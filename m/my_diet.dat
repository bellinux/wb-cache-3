60|$|One day I {{discovered}} an old prostrate tree, buried under a thick growth of creeper and fern, {{the wood of}} which was nearly or quite rotten, as I proved by thrusting my knife to the heft in it. No doubt it would contain grubs--those huge, white wood-borers which now formed an important item in <b>my</b> <b>diet.</b> On the following day I returned to the spot with a chopper and a bundle of wedges to split the trunk up, but had scarcely commenced operations when an animal, startled at my blows, rushed or rather wriggled from its hiding-place under the dead wood {{at a distance of}} a few yards from me. It was a robust, round-headed, short-legged creature, about as big as a good-sized cat, and clothed in a thick, greenish-brown fur. The ground all about was covered with creepers, binding the ferns, bushes, and old dead branches together; and in this confused tangle the animal scrambled and tore with a great show of energy, but really made very little progress; and all at once it flashed into my mind that it was a sloth--a common animal, but rarely seen on the ground--with no tree near to take refuge in. The shock of joy this discovery produced was great enough to unnerve me, and for some moments I stood trembling, hardly able to breathe; then recovering I hastened after it, and stunned it with a blow from my chopper on its round head.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR MOTHER,--This letter, {{which will}} be {{forwarded}} on our arrival at [...] Portsmouth, probably about the 4th of July, is begun about [...] twenty-three days after our departure from Malta. I have just been two [...] years (to a day, on the 2d of July) absent from England, and I return [...] to it with much the same feelings which prevailed on my departure, [...] viz. indifference; but within that apathy I certainly do not comprise [...] yourself, as I will prove by every means in my power. You will be good [...] enough to get my apartments ready at Newstead; but don't disturb [...] yourself, on any account, particularly mine, nor consider me in any [...] other light than as a visiter. I must only inform you {{that for a long}} [...] time I have been restricted to an entire vegetable diet, neither fish [...] nor flesh coming within my regimen; so I expect a powerful stock of [...] potatoes, greens, and biscuit; I drink no wine. I have two servants, [...] middle-aged men, and both Greeks. It is my intention to proceed first [...] to town, to see Mr. Hanson, and thence to Newstead, on my way to [...] Rochdale. I have only to beg you will not forget <b>my</b> <b>diet,</b> which it is [...] very necessary for me to observe.

60|$|This annual {{gathering}} of booksellers {{from all over}} America comes together ostensibly to eat and drink, but really to discuss, business; therefore I am required to, talk shop. I am required to furnish a statement of the indebtedness under which I lie to you gentlemen for your help in enabling me to earn my living. For something over forty years I have acquired my bread by print, beginning with The Innocents Abroad, followed at intervals of {{a year or so}} by Roughing It, Tom Sawyer, Gilded Age, and so on. For thirty-six years my books were sold by subscription. You are not interested in those years, but only in the four which have since followed. The books passed into the hands of my present publishers at the beginning of 1900, and you then became the providers of <b>my</b> <b>diet.</b> I think I may say, without flattering you, that you have done exceedingly well by me. Exceedingly well is not too strong a phrase, since the official statistics show that in four years you have sold twice as many volumes of my venerable books as my contract with my publishers bound you and them to sell in five years. To your sorrow you are aware that frequently, much too frequently, when a book gets to be five or ten years old its annual sale shrinks to two or three hundred copies, and after an added ten or twenty years ceases to sell. But you sell thousands of my moss-backed old books every year--the youngest of them being books that range from fifteen to twenty-seven years old, and the oldest reaching back to thirty-five and forty.|$|E
