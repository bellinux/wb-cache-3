5|$|Buses are an {{important}} part of the Northern transport <b>mix,</b> <b>with</b> bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.|$|E

5|$|Since Smallville began airing, {{a variety}} of {{merchandise}} connected with the series has been produced. Two soundtrack albums of songs from the show have been released. On February 25, 2003 Smallville: The Talon <b>Mix,</b> <b>with</b> a group of artists who licensed their music for the show, was issued. Smallville: The Metropolis <b>Mix,</b> <b>with</b> another group of artists, was released on November 8, 2005. In addition to the soundtracks, action figures, T-shirts, hats and posters have been produced. In December 2002 autographed Smallville merchandise was listed for auction on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity. In 2003, Titan Magazines began publishing a monthly Smallville magazine with cast and crew interviews, information on Smallville merchandise and photos. The 34th and final issue was published in November 2009.|$|E

5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot <b>mix</b> <b>with</b> genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{deals with}} the effect of {{salinity}} of groundwater on some properties of clayey soil. Properties obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> water containing different salt contents are compared with those obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (tap water). The tested samples {{were taken from the}} site of the Faculty of Engineering in Qena, South Valley University. Two sets of samples of the clay soil were tested. One was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (pure water clay soil) and the other was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty water added to it in ratios ranging from 20 % to 80 % (clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salt). The test results showed the effect of groundwater salinity on the tested samples. The plasticity index decreased from 26 for pure water clay soil to 24. 96 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The coefficient of consolidation increased from 0. 00196 for pure water clay soil to 0. 002744 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The California bearing ratio increased from 9. 75 % for pure water clay soil to 10. 15 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The optimum moisture content increased from 14. 25 % for pure water clay soil to 16. 5 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 100 % salt. Decrease in the maximum dry density is observed for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty when compared with pure water clay soil. A marked decrease was noticed for the value of the unconfined compressive strength. All the tests were carried out in the Soil Mechanics and Foundations Lab, Faculty of Engineering in Qena, South Valley University...|$|R

5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.

5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not <b>mix</b> <b>with</b> others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could <b>mix</b> <b>with</b> intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held {{as something of a}} hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally <b>mix</b> <b>with</b> water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E
5|$|Sea vessels were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to <b>mix</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the cement-stabilized soil can be improved {{by the use of}} seawater. Compressive strength test results show that the {{strength of}} cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater is 50 % greater than that <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater at the 90 th day. However, the application is limited because the expansion of the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater increases significantly. A kind of ultrafine silica fume was added into the cement-stabilized soil to inhibit swelling of the cement-stabilized soil with seawater. The expansion of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater by adding ultrafine silica fume is close to that of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater.

The mechanisms of adding ultrafine silica fume into the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater are revealed by several physical and chemical characterization parameters, such as specific gravity, unbound water content, surface morphology seen with SEM, and crystal products by X-ray diffraction tests.
