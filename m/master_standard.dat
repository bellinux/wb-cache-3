50|$|Krogius {{qualified}} {{for his first}} Soviet final by scoring 11.5/19, for a tied 5th-7th place, in the semi-final at Leningrad 1957. The final was at Riga 1958, URS-ch25, and he debuted strongly with 9.5/18 and a tied 9th-11th place; the winner was Mikhail Tal. Although he did not as yet earn an international title for this, it showed that he was of at least International <b>Master</b> <b>standard</b> by this time, because of the immense strength of the Soviet finals. He made his first appearances for the USSR in team matches against Bulgaria (Sofia 1957) and Yugoslavia (Zagreb 1958), scoring 50 percent in both. At Tbilisi for URS-ch26, he scored just 6.5/19 for 18th place; the winner was Petrosian. He improved at Leningrad for URS-ch27, scoring 10/19 for a tied 9th-10th place, as Viktor Korchnoi won.|$|E
50|$|Lipnitsky {{never got}} the chance to compete internationally in an {{individual}} tournament, missing out on the chance to earn international chess titles. Very few Soviet players {{got the chance to}} compete internationally during those years, and invitations were controlled by the USSR Chess Federation. In the Ukraine of his peak years, the region had more than 30 million people, and chess was very popular, with many strong players. By the chess standards of the 21st century, with Ukraine now an independent nation since 1991, Lipnitsky was certainly of International <b>Master</b> <b>standard,</b> and likely Grandmaster level. Lipnitsky achieved victories over most of the top Soviet players of his era during his peak years from 1948-56, including Paul Keres, Vasily Smyslov, Tigran Petrosian, Alexander Kotov, Yuri Averbakh, Igor Bondarevsky, Mark Taimanov, Efim Geller, Semyon Furman, Lev Aronin, Alexei Suetin, Ilya Kan, and Evgeny Vasiukov, among others. He had a wide opening repertoire with both colours, and his style was positional in nature, with tactics not dominating, but flowing from the situation.|$|E
40|$|Our paper {{deals with}} the use of {{mathematics}} when studying the physics of electromagnetism. We have concentrated on common electromagnetic concepts (magnetic field and flux) and their associated mathematical representation and arithmetical tools.

50|$|There is a three-level {{hierarchy}} of physical measurement standards. At {{the top of}} the tree are the <b>master</b> <b>standards</b> - these are known as primary standards. Primary standards are made to the highest metrological quality and are the definitive definition or realization of their unit of measure. Historically, units of measure were generally defined with reference to unique artifacts which were the legal basis of units of measure. A continuing trend in metrology is to eliminate as many as possible of the artifact standards and instead define practical units of measure in terms of fundamental physical constants, as demonstrated by standardized technique. One advantage of elimination of artifact standards is that inter-comparison of artifacts is no longer required. Another advantage would be that the loss or damage of the artifact standards would not disrupt the system of measures.|$|R

5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a <b>master</b> <b>standard</b> such as the international prototype meter. This bar of metal, like the , is maintained under controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures headquarters in France, {{which is one of}} the principal measurement standards laboratories of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as NIST), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as [...] "NIST traceable" [...] means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.|$|E
5000|$|About 88% of {{the people}} habitually speak the Isan {{language}} at home, while 11% say they speak both Isan and Central Thai among themselves, and only 1% speak Central Thai exclusively. [...] "Isan", [...] "Lao" [...] and [...] "Thai" [...] languages form a dialect continuum, {{in many cases the}} linguistic varieties do not coincide with the geographical and political boundaries. Defining and differentiating these three [...] "languages" [...] according to objective, linguistic criteria is impossible. The different terms are rather used for political and emotional reasons. In official contexts as well as in school and university classes, only Standard Thai is allowed. There are hardly any mass media publishing or broadcasting in Isan. Many Isan people, especially the younger and well-educated ones as well as those living in towns or outside their native region, <b>master</b> <b>standard</b> Thai on a native or near-native level. Some of them are even shy to speak their original language in public or in presence of Thais from other regions due to the low social prestige. Many Central Thais, but also some Isan speakers, associate Isan language with uneducateness and backwardness. Therefore, many Isan practice diglossia (i.e. Isan in familiar and informal contexts, standard Thai in public and official ones) or code-switching in their everyday lives.|$|E

40|$|From 2015, Australian {{universities}} will {{be required}} to demonstrate that their programmes explicitly teach and assess achievement of, knowledge and skills, and the application of both as specified by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). Over the last twenty years, the sector has applied significant effort and resources to embedding the development of skills through tertiary programmes.

The authors propose a 'massive open online course' (MOOC) approach to teaching and assessing AQF required skills. As an example, the paper identifies the skills MOOCs that would need to be developed by experts in each skill area for AQF level 9 masters by coursework programmes. The proposed MOOC would include assessment tasks and rubrics allowing students to develop and demonstrate achievement of the AQF required skills.
