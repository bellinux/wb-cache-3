500|$|On April 14, 2009, MTV News {{announced}} that Ellis had nearly finished {{the novel and}} it would be published in May 2010. At the time, Ellis revealed that all the novel's main characters would return. Prior to publication, Ellis had been convinced by his persuasive editor to remove some of the more graphic lines from Imperial Bedrooms torture scenes, which he later regretted. [...] "My most extreme act of self-censoring in Imperial Bedrooms," [...] he said, however, was to omit a three-line description of a silver wall, because he felt that Clay would never have written it. Ellis stated he had no plans to make changes to the book as it stands in a second edition. Months prior to the book's release, Ellis tweeted the first sentence of the novel, [...] "They had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about us." [...] The Random House website later announced the on sale date of June 22, 2010 in both hardback and paperback. With it, they released a picture of the book's cover and a short synopsis, which described the book as focusing on a middle-aged Clay, now a screenwriter, drawn back into his old circle. Amidst this, Clay begins dating a young actress with mysterious ties to Julian, Rip and a recently murdered Hollywood producer; his life begins to spin out of control. In Imperial Bedrooms, Los Angeles returns once again as the book's setting. It is, along with New York, one of the two major locations in Ellis' fiction.|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite this restriction, many {{media outlets}} refused {{to run the}} poster, or any ad that {{includes}} the word [...] "porno" [...] in the title, including a number of newspapers, TV stations, cable channels, and city governments, some of which responded to complaints about the ads at baseball stadiums and city bus stops. Many theaters displayed the film's title on their marquee as merely Zack and Miri. Weinstein Company marketing head Gary Faber stated that the ad was accepted {{in most of the}} outlets that were offered it, but that the studio would consider variations of the title for outlets that rejected it, including one version of the poster without the title that bears the slogan, [...] "Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> so outrageous that we can't even tell you the title." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times observed, [...] "In {{translating}} the novel into a film, the producer Ismail Merchant, his directing partner, James Ivory, and their favorite screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> that's an ambitious, profoundly ambiguous statement {{about their own}} passion for the cultivated, high-culture sensibility epitomized by James and E.M. Forster, {{as opposed to the}} cruder mass culture that has eclipsed these literary heroes [...] [...] [...] Much of the dialogue in Ms. Jhabvala's carefully wrought screenplay voices feelings that remain unspoken in the novel, and this is the movie's biggest problem. No matter how well the characters' thoughts have been translated into speech, the act of compressing their rich, complex inner lives into dialogue without resorting to voice-over narration inevitably tends to cheapen them and turn a drama about the revelation of hidden truths into the terser, more commonplace language of an intelligent soap opera." ...|$|E

Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to [...] "get girls", he says he created the site because he enjoys [...] "building things". However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, [...] "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right – like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own." ...|$|E
2500|$|A movie {{based on}} Zuckerberg and the {{founding}} years of Facebook, The Social Network {{was released on}} October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.

The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as [...] "big juicy fun" [...] rather than [...] "reportage". The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, [...] "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, [...] "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?" ...|$|E

Ebert also praised Vincent Gallo's performance and claimed that Alden Ehrenreich is [...] "the new Leonardo DiCaprio". Todd McCarthy of Variety gave the film a B+ judging that [...] "when Coppola finds creative nirvana, he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola [...] "has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true."

2500|$|After {{the film}} release in November, Akhil Rajendra Dwivedi, a script writer, sued Bhansali for Rs. 20million {{alleging that the}} {{director}} used his script without informing him.
