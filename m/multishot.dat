40|$|A lithium {{fluoride}} (LiF) crystal has been utilized {{as a new}} soft X-ray detector to image different biological samples at a high spatial resolution. This new type of image detector for X-ray microscopy has many interesting properties: high resolution (nanometer scale), permanent storage of images, the ability to clear the image and reuse the LiF crystal, and high contrast with greater dynamic range. Cells of the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas dysosmos and Chlorella sorokiniana, and pollen grains of Olea europea {{have been used as}} biological materials for imaging. The biological samples were imaged on LiF crystals by using the soft X-ray contact microscopy and contact micro-radiography techniques. The laser plasma soft X-ray source was generated using a Nd:YAG/Glass laser focused on a solid target. The X-ray energy range for image acquisition was in the water-window spectral range for single shot contact microscopy of very thin biological samples (single cells) and around 1 keV for <b>multishots</b> microradiography. The main aim {{of this article is to}} highlight the possibility of using a LiF crystal as a detector for the biological imaging using soft X-ray radiation and to demonstrate its ability to visualize the microstructure within living cells...|$|R

50|$|CO2 is {{commonly}} found in <b>multishot</b> airguns, from the cheapest plinkers to Olympic class target guns, though the latter are facing competition from regulated precharged pneumatics. CO2's advantage {{is that it is}} stored in a liquid form, rather than a gas, and as such provides a greater power density. The liquid also provides a constant pressure, the vapor pressure, {{as long as there is}} liquid remaining in the reservoir. The downside to CO2 is that it is dependent upon the vapor pressure, which changes significantly with temperature. This is of primary concern to outdoor shooters, who may shoot in widely varying temperatures, or for rapid fire shooters, as rapid release of the gas results in a rapid drop in the temperature of the liquid.|$|E

5000|$|An airbomb {{is a type}} of firework. It {{is simply}} a {{concentration}} of flashpowder in a paper case, that is ejected into the air with a black-powder lifting charge, ignited by a fuse. The flashpowder explodes in midair with a loud [...] "bang" [...] and a bright white flash. Single tube airbombs were banned in Britain in 2004, because they are classed as a cheap, nuisance firework. <b>Multishot</b> airbombs are still legal in Britain. The airbomb effect, a loud bang and flash, continues {{to be a part of}} many larger fireworks. Since 1 April 2008, any firework which contains at least one tube containing over 5% flashpowder will be classed under United Nations regulations as 1.3G, with stricter transportation and storage regulation. This effectively means that any firework containing a flashpowder effect will not be legally available for sale after this date. As such, manufacturers are replacing the [...] "bang" [...] with a crackle effect, or are using black-powder bursts. However these are more expensive and don't have the traditional [...] "flash" [...] effect.|$|E
50|$|The last type of {{pneumatic}} airgun is the precharged pneumatic. This {{is both an}} old and a new design; some of {{the earliest}} airguns, such as the model carried by Lewis and Clark, were of this type, as are many new cutting edge models. The precharged pneumatic uses an external source of compressed air, either an external pump or a high pressure reservoir such as a SCUBA tank, to fill a reservoir. The reservoir can be a small, single-shot one, such as in the Brocock Air Cartridge system, or a large, multi-shot tank. The key to top accuracy in a precharged pneumatic is a consistent pressure. With <b>multishot</b> systems (as are most), the pressure in the reservoir will drop with each shot fired, so the best way to achieve consistency is with a pressure regulator, which provides a steady, but lower, pressure at the valve, {{for as long as the}} reservoir pressure remains higher than the regulated pressure. Regulators are also generally adjustable, so a low pressure setting will provide many shots of lower power, while a high pressure setting will provide a few high power shots.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel {{engines are}} also {{produced}} with two significantly different injection locations: [...] "direct" [...] and [...] "indirect." [...] Indirect injection engines place the injector in a pre-combustion chamber in the head, which, due to thermal losses, generally require a [...] "glow plug" [...] {{to start and}} a very high compression ratio, usually between 21:1 and 23:1. Direct injection engines use a generally donut-shaped combustion chamber void {{on the top of}} the piston. Thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in DI engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio, generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most DI engines are closer to 17:1. The direct injection (DI) process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design and more robust construction. The lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn. Turbocharging is particularly suited to DI engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction. The increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency, not only from more complete combustion, but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated, by widening both power and efficiency curves. The violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise, but modern designs using [...] "split shot" [...] injectors or similar <b>multishot</b> processes have dramatically ameliorated this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery, which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt, and in most cases slightly cleaner, burn.{citation needed} ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To correct line-to-line {{delays and}} phase errors in echo-planar imaging (EPI). THEORY AND METHODS: EPI- {{trajectory}} auto-corrected image reconstruction (EPI-TrACR) is an iterative maximum-likelihood technique that exploits data redundancy provided by multiple receive coils between nearby lines of k-space to determine and correct line-to-line trajectory delays and phase errors that cause ghosting artifacts. EPI-TrACR {{was applied to}} in vivo data acquired at 7 Tesla across acceleration and <b>multishot</b> factors, and in a dynamic time series. The method was efficiently implemented using a segmented FFT and compared to a conventional calibrated reconstruction. RESULTS: Compared to conventional calibrated reconstructions, EPI-TrACR reduced ghosting up to moderate acceleration factors and across <b>multishot</b> factors. It also maintained low ghosting in a dynamic time series. Averaged over all cases, EPI-TrACR reduced root-mean-square ghosted signal outside the brain by 27 % compared to calibrated reconstruction. CONCLUSION: EPI-TrACR is effective in automatically correcting line-to-line delays and phase errors in <b>multishot,</b> accelerated, and dynamic EPI.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop new}} {{techniques}} {{for reducing the}} effects of microscopic and macroscopic patient motion in diffusion imaging acquired with high-resolution <b>multishot</b> echo-planar imaging. Theory: The previously reported multiplexed sensitivity encoding (MUSE) algorithm is extended to account for macroscopic pixel misregistrations, as well as motion-induced phase errors in a technique called augmented MUSE (AMUSE). Furthermore, to obtain more accurate quantitative diffusion-tensor imaging measures {{in the presence of}} subject motion, we also account for the altered diffusion encoding among shots arising from macroscopic motion. Methods: MUSE and AMUSE were evaluated on simulated and in vivo motion-corrupted <b>multishot</b> diffusion data. Evaluations were made both on the resulting imaging quality and estimated diffusion tensor metrics. Results: AMUSE was found to reduce image blurring resulting from macroscopic subject motion compared to MUSE but yielded inaccurate tensor estimations when neglecting the altered diffusion encoding. Including the altered diffusion encoding in AMUSE produced better estimations of diffusion tensors. Conclusion: The use of AMUSE allows for improved image quality and diffusion tensor accuracy in the presence of macroscopic subject motion during <b>multishot</b> diffusion imaging. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Half-Fourier RARE and <b>multishot</b> RARE imaging and helical CT were performed in 48 patients with 102 focal liver lesions and in three patients with diffuse metastatic liver disease. Images were compared qualitatively and quantitatively for image quality, lesion conspicuity, and ability to help differentiate solid lesions from hemangiomas. RESULTS: All half-Fourier RARE images were free of respiratory artifact. In the 48 patients with 102 focal lesions, CT, half-Fourier RARE, and <b>multishot</b> RARE images depicted 101, 99, and 90 lesions (99 %, 97 %, and 88 %), respectively. CT failed to depict focal lesions in one patient with diffuse metastatic liver disease. All techniques had high accuracy for distinction of hemangiomas from solid masses (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were between 0. 96 and 0. 99).

40|$|High-resolution {{functional}} MRI is {{a leading}} application for very high field (7 Tesla) human MR imaging. Though higher field strengths promise improvements in signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and BOLD contrast relative to fMRI at 3 Tesla, these benefits may be partially offset by accompanying increases in geometric distortion and other off-resonance effects. Such effects may be especially pronounced with the single-shot EPI pulse sequences typically used for fMRI at standard field strengths. As an alternative, one might consider <b>multishot</b> pulse sequences, which may lead to somewhat lower temporal SNR than standard EPI, but which are also often substantially less susceptible to off-resonance effects. Here we consider retinotopic mapping of human visual cortex as a practical test case by which to compare examples of these sequence types for high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla. We performed polar angle retinotopic mapping at each of 3 isotropic resolutions (2. 0, 1. 7, and 1. 1 mm) using both accelerated single-shot 2 D EPI and accelerated <b>multishot</b> 3 D gradient-echo pulse sequences. We found that single-shot EPI indeed led to greater temporal SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) than the <b>multishot</b> sequences. However, additional distortion correction in postprocessing was {{required in order to}} fully realize these advantages, particularly at higher resolutions.
