25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> amounts to very little.|$|E

But when he chooses, {{in the course of his}} economies, to economise at the expense of human life, when his economy involves the withholding from his employees of reasonable remuneration, or reasonable conditions of human existence, then, as I understand the Act, Parliament insists on the payment of the Excise duty.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition. The evidence for this is in <b>my</b> <b>view</b> very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E

25|$|The proper policy, in <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In <b>my</b> <b>view</b> our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different people who are still currently trying to tread their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks <b>my</b> <b>view</b> of the computer screen).|$|E
