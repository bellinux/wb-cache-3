5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower <b>mole</b> <b>fraction</b> solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Instrumented {{aircraft}} measuring air {{composition in}} the Uinta Basin, Utah, during February 2012 and January-February 2013 documented dramatically different atmospheric ozone (O 3) <b>mole</b> <b>fractions.</b> In 2012 O 3 remained near levels of ∼ 40 ppb in a well-mixed 500 – 1000 m deep boundary layer while in 2013, O 3 <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> > 140 ppb were measured {{in a shallow}} (∼ 200 m) boundary layer. In contrast to 2012 when <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> of emissions from {{oil and gas production}} such as methane (CH 4), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and combustion products such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) were moderately elevated, in winter 2013 very high <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> were observed. Snow cover in 2013 helped produce and maintain strong temperature inversions that capped a shallow cold pool layer. In 2012, O 3 and CH 4 and associated NMHCs <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> were not closely related. In 2013, O 3 <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> were correlated with CH 4 and a suite of NMHCs identifying the gas field as the primary source of the O 3 precursor NMHC emissions. In 2013 there was a strong positive correlation between CH 4 and CO 2 suggesting combustion from oil and natural gas processing activities. The presence of O 3 precursor NMHCs through the depth of the boundary layer in 2013 led to O 3 production throughout the layer. In 2013, O 3 <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> increased {{over the course of the}} week-long episodes indicating O 3 photochemical production was larger than dilution and deposition rates, while CH 4 <b>mole</b> <b>fractions</b> began to level off after 3 days indicative of some air being mixed out of the boundary layer. The plume of a coal-fired power plant located east of the main gas field was not an important contributor to O 3 or O 3 precursors in the boundary layer in 2013...|$|R

25|$|Solubility is {{commonly}} {{expressed as a}} concentration; for example, as g of solute per kg of solvent, g per dL (100mL) of solvent, molarity, molality, <b>mole</b> <b>fraction,</b> etc. The maximum equilibrium amount of solute that can dissolve per amount of solvent is the solubility of that solute in that solvent under the specified conditions. The advantage of expressing solubility in this manner is its simplicity, while the disadvantage {{is that it can}} strongly depend on the presence of other species in the solvent (for example, the common ion effect).|$|E

Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is very rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (this {{is about the same}} as the molecular or <b>mole</b> <b>fraction),</b> and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner (terrestrial) planets is that neon [...] is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason. It is also lighter than air, causing it to escape even from Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
