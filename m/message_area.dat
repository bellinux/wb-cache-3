50|$|The Arduino project {{provides}} the Arduino {{integrated development environment}} (IDE), which is a cross-platform application written in the programming language Java. It originated from the IDE for the languages Processing and Wiring. It includes a code editor with features such as text cutting and pasting, searching and replacing text, automatic indenting, brace matching, and syntax highlighting, and provides simple one-click mechanisms to compile and upload programs to an Arduino board. It also contains a <b>message</b> <b>area,</b> a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a hierarchy of operation menus.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC, Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted [...] "Color Your Own" [...] postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor. There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme [...] "From gratitude springs happiness". Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line. The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each - the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude ("What are we grateful for") on {{the upper part of the}} <b>message</b> <b>area</b> for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick an US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower <b>message</b> <b>area</b> and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.|$|E

50|$|The {{utilization}} {{of a natural}} metaphor, the concept of rooms devoted to topics, marked Citadel's main advancement over previous BBS packages {{in the area of}} organization. Messages are associated with rooms, to which the user moves in order to participate in discussions; similarly, a room could optionally give access to the underlying file system, permitting the organization of available files in an organic manner. Most installations permitted any user to create a room, resulting in a dynamic ebb and flow closer to true conversation than most other BBS packages achieved. Certain versions of Citadel extend the metaphor of rooms with “hallways” and/or “floors,” organizing groups of rooms according to system requirement. By contrast, previous bulletin board software emphasized the availability of files, with a single uncoupled <b>message</b> <b>area</b> that could only be read linearly, forward or backward.|$|E
50|$|The NES {{version is}} a port {{of the earlier}} {{computer}} versions. However, there are several differences between them: The NES version uses fewer screens than its homecomputer counterparts, even fewer sounds, and much simplified controls. While the original game uses units of soldiers in platoons which were upgradeable, the NES game condensed the battle elements to missiles and hover tanks against ground defenses, none {{of which can be}} upgraded. The <b>message</b> <b>area</b> is much larger in the other versions, and placed along the right hand side of the screen, compared to bottom center of the NES game. The NES game allows a single saved game to be stored, compared to up to four on the homecomputer games. In the NES version only credits are required to buy craft, whereas the original versions require the player to spend money, minerals, fuel and energy (though this varies depending on the difficulty level). Finally, the use of the docking bays is more complex in the computer games, and the other versions have a feature where an image of the face of the enemy grows clearer the closer the player is to defeating the game.|$|E

40|$|Wearing {{comfort of}} {{clothing}} {{is dependent on}} air permeability, moisture absorbency and wicking properties of fabric, which {{are related to the}} porosity of fabric. In this work, a plug-in is developed using Python script and incorporated in Abaqus/CAE for the prediction of porosity of plain weft knitted fabrics. The Plug-in is able to automatically generate 3 D solid and multifilament weft knitted fabric models and accurately determine the porosity of fabrics in two steps. In this work, plain weft knitted fabrics made of monofilament, multifilament and spun yarn made of staple fibers were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the developed plug-in. In the case of staple fiber yarn, intra yarn porosity was considered in the calculation of porosity. The first step is to develop a 3 D geometrical model of plain weft knitted fabric and the second step is to calculate the porosity of the fabric by using the geometrical parameter of 3 D weft knitted fabric model generated in step one. The predicted porosity of plain weft knitted fabric is extracted in the second step and is displayed in the <b>message</b> <b>area.</b> The predicted results obtained from the plug-in have been compared with the experimental results obtained from previously developed models; they agreed well...|$|E

30|$|Figure  5 b {{shows the}} {{comparison}} of data delivery ratio in the three algorithms {{in the case of}} different <b>message</b> coverage <b>area.</b> From the chart, we can see that data delivery ratio has a sharp decrease due to data collisions. This is because as the length of road increases, the <b>message</b> coverage <b>area</b> increases accordingly. So, that delay of messages increases and leads to message dropping. By comparison, the delivery ratio of DSV-BD has the slowest descending speed and is 7.90 % higher than that of epidemic and 8.91 % higher than that of UMB on average.|$|R

40|$|In {{distributed}} {{combinatorial optimization}} problems, dynamic programming algorithms like DPOP ([Petcu and Faltings, 2005]) require only a linear number of messages, thus generating low communication overheads. However, DPOP’s memory requirements are exponential in the induced {{width of the}} constraint graph, which may be prohibitive for problems with large width. We present MB-DPOP, a new hybrid algorithm that can operate with bounded memory. In areas of low width, MB-DPOP operates like standard DPOP (linear number of <b>messages).</b> <b>Areas</b> of high width are explored with bounded propagations using the idea of cycle-cuts [Dechter, 2003]. We introduce novel DFS-based mechanisms for determining the cycle-cutset, and for grouping cycle-cut nodes into clusters. We use caching ([Darwiche, 2001]) between clusters to reduce the complexity to exponential in {{the largest number of}} cycle cuts in a single cluster. We compare MB-DPOP with ADOPT [Modi et al., 2005], {{the current state of the}} art in distributed search with bounded memory. MB-DPOP consistently outperforms ADOPT on 3 problem domains, with respect to 3 metrics, providing speedups of up to 5 orders of magnitude. ...|$|R
