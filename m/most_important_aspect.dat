5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers {{must agree to}} a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him.

After the war, he obtained a regular commission. Already qualified as an aerial observer, he became a pilot in 1922. For many years he was an influential instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School. Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of air power. He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all of the factories. The doctrine which Wilson expounded later {{became the basis for}} AWPD-1, the Army Air Forces' strategic war plan developed in 1941.|$|E

25|$|This quote {{demonstrates}} Bowlby's {{entire career}} {{focusing on a}} child's early environmental experiences.

They could also call upon the B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Far Eastern Strategic Air Force.

25|$|When and how {{applications}} are taught varies from style to style. Today, many styles begin to teach new students {{by focusing on}} exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, {{in order to allow}} its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012 The Guardian {{reported}} that Al Jazeera's editorial independence came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped {{in at the}} last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the Syrian civil war include a speech by the leader of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.

The Guardian also said in September 2012 that Qatar had taken steps in recent years to consolidate control of Al Jazeera English.|$|E
25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of the routinization Hasidism {{underwent}} was {{the adoption}} of dynasticism. The first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the Besht was his grandson, Boruch of Medzhybizh, appointed 1782. He held a lavish court with Hershel of Ostropol as jester, and demanded the other Righteous acknowledge his supremacy. Upon the death of Menachem Nachum Twersky of Chernobyl, his son Mordechai Twersky succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye was defeated by his son, Dovber Schneuri, whose offspring retained the title for 181 years.|$|E
