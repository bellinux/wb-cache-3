40|$|Motivation: In {{chromatin}} immunoprecipitation {{followed by}} high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and other short read sequencing experiments, a considerable {{fraction of the}} short reads align to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads). Inferring the origin of multi-reads is critical for accurately mapping reads to repetitive regions. Current state-of-the-art <b>multi-read</b> allocation algorithms rely on the read counts in the local neighbourhood of the alignment locations and ignore the variation in the copy-numbers of these regions. Copy-number variation (CNV) can directly affect the read densities and, therefore, bias allocation of multi-reads. Results: We propose cnvCSEM (cnv-guided ChIP-Seq by Expectation-Maximization algorithm), a flexible framework that incorporates CNV in <b>multi-read</b> allocation. cnvCSEM eliminates the CNV bias in <b>multi-read</b> allocation by initializing the read allocation algorithm with CNV-aware initial values. Our data-driven simulations illustrate that cnvCSEM leads to higher read coverage with satisfactory accuracy and lower loss in read-depth recovery (estimation). We evaluate the biological relevance of the cnvCSEM allocated reads and the resultant peaks with the analysis of several ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Sequencing reads {{generated}} by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) {{must first be}} mapped back to the genome through alignment {{before they can be}} further analyzed. Current fast and memory-saving short-read mappers could give us a quick view of the transcriptome. However, they are neither designed for reads that span across splice junctions nor for repetitive reads, which can be mapped to multiple locations in the genome (<b>multi-reads).</b> Here, we describe a new software package: ABMapper, which is specifically designed for exploring all putative locations of reads that are mapped to splice junctions or repetitive in nature...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the <b>Multi-reading</b> digital literacy, an {{expression}} that synthesizes a new perspective of educational strategy to improve basic-skills in students, such as the reading literacy, and some transversal competences: the creative thought, the critical comprehension and the civicness using digital tools and languages. The starting point is the learning outcomes of the reading literacy in the OCDE 2009, according to which many European countries are below the average. The learning quality {{is connected to the}} teaching quality, that often corresponds to the adequacy and the effectiveness of teaching strategies adopted to improve these skills. Hence, in the Eurydice report 2012 it is reported that the diversity of reading materials seems to develop the reading proficiency, as well as the crossbreeding of more texts (images, sounds, words and so on) improves the “reading skills”. In this picture, the cross-media approach can become a strategy to stimulate the perception, the cognition, the emotions and the behaviour of young people, paying attention to the connections among language, meanings and human relationships to construct multilevel-texts, typical of convergent era. The cross-media behaviour is already widely spread in the consumption of young generations, so it has developed forms of simultaneous thought, based on synoptic inputs organized in chaotic way, and on the de-structuration of syntactic rules of the text. This kind of consumption progressively weakens the reflective, individualized and abstract thought, connected to memorization of knowledge coming from the traditional book. The cross-media as <b>multi-reading</b> strategy can balance these two thoughts (simultaneous and reflective) through the construction of educational paths on the learning to read, i. e. understanding what you read and using it as a tool for learning. The pupil understands rich and decontextualized knowledge of a word’s meaning, its relationship with other meanings and other words and its extension to metaphorical uses [1]. In this way, the cross-media contributes to develop the reading comprehension, that means: “intentional thinking during which meaning is constructed through interactions between the reader and the text” [2]. According to this reasoning, the knowledge perspectives not only come from the practice, the experience or technical skills (functional literacy), but from social and cultural capital built from the intergenerational exchange in the educational contexts. Hence, the literacy is transformed, it isn’t only a skill, but it is a critique, that means creative writing, critical reading and aware planning...|$|R
40|$|Oladipo Agboluaje {{is one of}} {{the third}} {{generation}} of playwrights of dual African and British heritage whose dramaturgies differ from the writings of first and second generation writers of African and Asian descents whose subjects and dramatic styles were shaped and defined primarily by their experiences of colonialism. Second generation writers among whom are Caryl Churchill, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Buchi Emecheta, Mustapha Mutura, Edgar White, Caryl Phillips, and Hanif Kureshs, set upon a different course, that of retrieving and re-writing pre-colonial, colonial, migrant, and dislocation experiences using the linguistic and narrative tropes of erstwhile colonisers as well as the hybridized languages they produced. Their works conveyed a radical and ideological fervour that was both essential in the development of post-colonialism as a literary and later subsequently as a multidisciplinary, <b>multi-reading</b> framework for analysing the political, social, economic, and literary developments of postcolonial societies. Since his debut on stage in the UK in 2003 Oladipo Agboluaje {{has become one of the}} most prolific of the third generation of Black British playwrights referred to here. This introduction to his plays, no less so the five in this volume; Early Morning, The Estate, The Christ of Coldharbour Lane, The Hounding of David Oluwale, and Iya-lle (The First Wife) can be grouped under a distinct category of postcolonial, postmodern writings on Nigerian-British diaspora experience...|$|R
40|$|Chromatin immunoprecipitation {{followed}} by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is rapidly replacing chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genome-wide tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip) as the preferred approach for mapping transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. The {{state of the}} art for analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome (uni-reads). This can lead to the omission of up to 30 % of alignable reads. We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads). Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT 1 and mouse GATA 1 ChIP-seq datasets, we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with unireads, and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. We investigate various genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected only by utilization of multi-reads via computational experiments. Overall, peaks from <b>multi-read</b> analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. We further validate a number of GATA 1 <b>multi-read</b> only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA 1. These computational and experimental results establish that <b>multi-read...</b>|$|E
40|$|Segmental duplications {{and other}} highly {{repetitive}} regions of genomes {{contribute significantly to}} cells' regulatory programs. Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50 - 100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves <b>multi-read</b> allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of <b>multi-read</b> allocation {{with a variety of}} data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM 12878 and K 562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments are {{an indispensable}} tool in bioinformatics. Many applications rely on accurate multiple alignments, including protein structure prediction, phylogeny and the modeling of binding sites. In this thesis we dissected and analyzed the crucial algorithms and data structures required to construct such a multiple alignment. Based upon that dissection, {{we present a}} novel graph-based multiple sequence alignment program and a new method for <b>multi-read</b> alignments occurring in assembly projects. The advantage of the graph-based alignment is that a single vertex can represent a single character, a large segment or even an abstract entity such as a gene. This {{gives rise to the}} opportunity to apply the consistencybased progressive alignment paradigm to alignments of genomic sequences. The proposed <b>multi-read</b> alignment method outperforms similar methods in terms of alignment quality and it is apparently one of the first methods that can readily be used for insert sequencing. An important aspect of this thesis was the design, the development and the integration of the essential multiple sequence alignment components in the SeqAn library. SeqAn is a software library for sequence analysis that provides the core algorithmic components required to analyze large-scale sequence data. SeqAn aims at bridging the current gap between algorithm theory and available practical implementations in bioinformatics. Hence, we always describe in conjunction to the theoretical development of the methods, the actual implementation of the data structures and algorithms in order to strengthen the use of SeqAn as an experimental platform for rapidly developing and testing applications. All presented methods are part of the open source SeqAn library that can be downloaded from our website, www. seqan. de...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a diffusion-based {{molecular}} {{communication channel}} between two nano-machines is considered. The {{effect of the}} amount of memory on performance is characterized, and a simple memory-limited decoder is proposed and its performance is shown to be close to that of the best possible imaginable decoder (without any restriction on the computational complexity or its functional form), using Genie-aided upper bounds. This effect is specialized for the case of Molecular Concentration Shift Keying; it is shown that a four-bits memory achieved nearly the same performance as infinite memory. Then a general class of threshold decoders is considered and shown not to be optimal for Poisson channel with memory, unless SNR is higher than a value specified in the paper. Another contribution is to show that receiver sampling at a rate higher than the transmission rate, i. e., a <b>multi-read</b> system, can significantly improve the performance. The associated decision rule for this system is shown to be a weighted sum of the samples during each symbol interval. The performance of the system is analyzed using the saddle point approximation. The best performance gains are achieved for an oversampling factor of three. Comment: Submitted to JSA...|$|E
40|$|As {{diminishing}} feature sizes {{drive down}} the energy for computations, the power budget for on-chip communication is steadily rising. Furthermore, {{the increasing number of}} cores is placing a huge performance burden on the network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write <b>Multi-Read</b> (MWMR) nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs. We then study explore the design space at the network level, by varying the waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3. 0 x or energy improvements of up to 1. 37 x over the base electronic network. Comment: 14 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
40|$|RNA Seq {{provides}} unparalleled {{levels of}} information about the transcriptome including precise expression levels over a wide dynamic range. It is essential to understand how technical variation impacts the quality and interpretability of results, how potential errors could be introduced by the protocol, how the source of RNA affects transcript detection, and how all of these variations can impact the conclusions drawn. Multiple human RNA samples were used to assess RNA fragmentation, RNA fractionation, cDNA synthesis, and single versus multiple tag counting. Though protocols employing polyA RNA selection generate the highest number of non-ribosomal reads and the most precise measurements for coding transcripts, such protocols were found to detect {{only a fraction of the}} non-ribosomal RNA in human cells. PolyA RNA excludes thousands of annotated and even more unannotated transcripts, resulting in an incomplete view of the transcriptome. Ribosomal-depleted RNA provides a more cost-effective method for generating complete transcriptome coverage. Expression measurements using single tag counting provided advantages for assessing gene expression and for detecting short RNAs relative to <b>multi-read</b> protocols. Detection of short RNAs was also hampered by RNA fragmentation. Thus, this work will help researchers choose from among a range of options when analyzing gene expression, each with its ow...|$|E
40|$|The {{simplicity}} of concurrent programming with Transactional Memory (TM) and its recent implementation in mainstream processors greatly motivates researchers and industry {{to investigate this}} field and propose new implementations and optimizations. However, {{there is still no}} standard C system library which a wide range of TM developers can adopt. TM application developers have been forced to avoid library calls inside of transactions or to execute them irrevocably (i. e. in serial order). In this paper, we present the first TM-aware system library, a complex software implementation integrated with TM principles and suited for software (STM), hardware (HTM) and hybrid TM (HyTM). The library we propose is derived from a modified lock-based implementation and can be used with the existing standard C API. In our work, we describe design challenges and code optimizations that would be specific to any TMbased system library or application. We argue about system call execution within transactions, highlighting the possibility of unexpected results from threads. For this reason we propose: (1) a mechanism for detecting conflicts over kernel data in user space, and (2) a new barrier to allow hybrid TM to be used effectively with system libraries. Our evaluation includes different TM implementations and the focus is on memory management and file operations since they are widely used in applications and require additional mechanisms for concurrent execution. We show the benefit we gain with our libc modifications providing parallel execution as much as possible. The library we propose shows high scalability when linked with STM and HTM. For file operations it shows on average a 1. 1, 2. 6 and 3. 7 x performance speedup for 8 cores using HyTM, STM and HTM, respectively (over a lock-based single-threaded execution). For a red-black tree it shows on average 3. 14 x performance speedup for 8 cores using STM (over a <b>multi-read</b> single-threaded execution). Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
