500|$|Nani celebrates with a [...] "mortal" [...] ("Leap of death"), {{similar to}} that of Obafemi Martins and Lomana LuaLua. The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child. For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety. Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has never spoken to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way. The conversations he has had with me are normal conversations, like he has with all players".|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and he was telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' {{or anything like that}} at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I was {{completely}} smitten. I remember thinking, “Why didn’t anybody tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> instrument?” I {{knew it was}} a gift, a revelation from the universe. I knew I had to play guitar. It was my salvation." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "All {{during this}} period, Dick was telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fabulous book called Planet of the Apes {{and that it}} was going to make a great movie. He said, [...] "I want you to play the ape, Dr. Zira." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Coming {{from the}} North, I knew I was totally ignorant," [...] Dolci wrote later. [...] "Looking all around me, I saw no streets, just mud and dust... I {{started working with}} masons and peasants, who kindly, gently, taught me their trades. That way my {{spectacles}} were no longer a barrier. Every day, all day, as the handle of hoe or shovel burned the blisters deeper, I learned more than any book could teach <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> people's struggle to exist..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his days}} in big band/swing music: [...] "It's really so long ago, one {{ought to be able}} to invoke a statute of limitations. I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. So I get calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who ask <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> period of my life as though it were the present. But I've moved on to other things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I shall," [...] she {{answered}} with a sad little smile. [...] "I look stronger than I am. Meanwhile you will come and tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> talisman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure," [...] she said, [...] "that {{you will not}} let me fall. You must be the {{wonderful}} person whom my daughter has told <b>me</b> <b>about.</b> Is <b>this</b> queer little place really your home?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2011 {{the company}} {{indicated}} that the price was being increased to US$149,000. Part of the price increase {{was due to the}} incorporation of optional features as standard, including the multi-function display, intercom and sun visors. About US$20,000 of the increase was to improve company profits on the aircraft. Russ Niles writing for AVweb noted [...] "The new price puts the Skycatcher at {{the upper end of the}} market for LSAs". The 30% price increase attracted aviation media attention. Paul Bertorelli writing for AVweb concluded [...] "Only one thing mystifies <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> decision. Cessna is the only LSA manufacturer well established with manufacturing in China. If a company with Cessna's economy of scale and marketing acumen can't make an LSA more affordable by building it in China, the notion of low-cost aircraft may very well be the myth that many people think it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Andrea Martin {{accepted}} the role, director René Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that {{working under the}} Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she'd ever done if she'd never worked under such makeup before. [...] Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he'd been so upfront with her. [...] Martin's makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. [...] Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup protheses. [...] Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they [...] "made a thin skin that went over one of [...] stock Ferengi heads [...] [...] They [...] made a new face for her, wrinkled, and did {{the backs of her}} hands." [...] The script for [...] "Family Business" [...] also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. [...] One take over Ishka's shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin's [...] "supple skin" [...] didn't match the character; Westmore and crew [...] "took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders", a process Martin didn't care for, saying, [...] "Boy, if you hadn't warned <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> I would be out the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966 a new French version, also by lyricist Michel Rivgauche, was {{recorded}} by Dalida as [...] "Parlez-Moi De Lui" [...] ("Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him"). <b>This</b> rendition slightly alters the original melody. This adaption {{was covered by}} Françoise Hardy in 1969.|$|R
