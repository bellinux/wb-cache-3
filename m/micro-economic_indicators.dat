In particular, a competing risks model is estimated taking into account the differences among variables leading firms to exit the market through bankruptcy, liquidation and inactivity. The determinants of financial distress for any exit route are identified {{on the basis of the}} influence on the hazard ratios of the significant variables selected for each state. Furthermore, the predictive performance of the competing-risks model over the single-risk framework is evaluated, with respect to different time windows, by means of some accuracy measures. The results reached on a sample of Italian firms provide support for the hypothesis that the factors influencing firms' way out strongly depend on the exit routes and highlighting the need to distinguish among them by means of a multiple-state approach...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} determinants of liquidity of commercial banks in the Republic of Serbia, observing the macroeconomic and banking-specific indicators, or <b>micro-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> which were analyzed by descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis from 2008 to 2014. The correlation for the observed variables is calculated from 140 samples for internal and external independent variables of impact to the dependent variable - liquidity measured by indicator of deposits. The subject of research is the process of optimization model reducing the factors of liquidity to variables that have the most significant impact on liquidity indicator measured by deposit potential. Results of the model show that liquidity of banks is dominantly determined by the size of banks assets. With growth of the assets, banks are exposed to a greater risk of liquidity. The increase in capital adequacy ratio has a positive effect on the liquidity of banks. Net interest margin is positively correlated with the indicator of deposit potential which indicates a negative impact on the liquidity of banks as well as the ratio of operating expenses to operating income...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{activity in}} the construction industry and following demand in especially built-in products triggered by apartment complexes makes Turkey an attractive country for investments. This report offers a comprehensive picture of the large household appliance market in Turkey, providing trends in household appliances production and consumption, imports and exports, as well as data on the supply structure and company profiles of the major household appliances manufacturers in Turkey. As far as the products are concerned, the report provides reference prices for refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, ovens, hoods and built-in ovens and hobs with estimated market shares for each product, together with an overview of the product trends in Turkey. The Turkish appliances industry has a distinct distribution network. The distribution section analyses the supply chain and the structure of independent distribution channels. The section is completed with an overview of large chains and malls. One section is dedicated to the driving forces behind demand containing <b>micro-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> and construction industry trends. Other factors are considered such as population and revenues. ...|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneInstitutions {{within the}} Farm Credit System (FCS) make risk-based lending {{decisions}}. As a primary lender to agriculture, these decisions {{are based on}} qualitative and quantitative procedures based on guidelines created {{for the purpose of}} measuring financial risk or the future probability that a loan will be in default of full repayment. As the risk increases, the cost to the FCS institution also increases to support a higher risk, higher probability of delinquency. Concentration risk, intrinsic risk, transaction risk, repayment risk, reputation risk are just a few examples of risk-based lending decisions. Under regulatory direction, FCS institutions have a charter to provide financing to agriculture’s food and fiber industries. The forest products industry is a large commodity borrower of risk-based financing within the FCS, specifically in the Pacific Northwest. Among other commodities, Northwest Farm Credit Services (Northwest FCS) supports the forest products industry through financial lending products. A majority of agricultural commodities reflect cycles of robust earnings and weak profits based on macro- and <b>micro-economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> The United States forest products industry had a period of strong earnings based primarily on the housing bubble between 2002 - 2007. With the U. S. economic recession beginning in 2008, the forest products industry also waned from 2008 - 2012. This impact resulted in financial stress for many forest product companies, both nationally and internationally. Due to the downturn in the forest products industry, regulators were quick to position the industry with high risk-based assumptions, thus putting pressure to Northwest FCS’ risk-guidelines in supporting that historical analysis accurately depicted industry risk. The purpose of this thesis is threefold: to study the correlation between different major commodity groups to better understand the value of a commodity concentration limit as a way to mitigate portfolio risk for Northwest FCS; to support analysis used by Northwest FCS and their ability to calculate the likelihood of financial stress; and provide customer-based feedback by way of a survey from forest products companies in the industry, as additional support to assumptions that were used to calculate certain subjective criteria for estimating risk. As one method to analyze financial risk, customer data was collected for the years ending 12 / 31 / 2008, 12 / 31 / 2011, and 12 / 31 / 2014. Statistical regression analysis was used to measure financial stress migration based on companies in the forest products industry. The regression analysis indicates financial measures of liquidity, leverage, and cash flow used for such calculated stress, specifically prior to the economic downturn of 2008, through the downturn of 2008 - 2012, and post-recovery of the forest products industry are correlated with measuring financial risk. As a risk mitigation tool, the board of directors that governs Northwest FCS hold a commodity concentration limit of fifteen percent (15 %) for the forest products industry. The customer survey provided information that allowed Northwest FCS to create subjective rating criteria for calculating risk. A guideline was created to assess subjective criteria provided by forest products customers on the same level based on the feedback provided which may be beneficial for understanding current results and potential future subjective risk associated within the industry...|$|E
