50|$|Typically a {{multi-tenant}} dwelling {{has either}} one <b>master</b> <b>meter</b> {{for the entire}} property or a meter for each building and the property {{is responsible for the}} entire utility bill. Submetering allows property owners who supply utilities to their tenants the ability to account for each tenant’s usage in measurable terms. By fairly billing each tenant for their portion, submetering promotes conservation and offsets the expense of bills generated from a <b>master</b> <b>meter,</b> maintenance and improvements for well water systems, lagoon, or septic systems. Submetering is legally allowable in most states and municipalities, but owners should consult a Utility Management Vendor for assistance with local and state compliance and regulations.|$|E
50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} <b>master</b> <b>meter</b> which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology <b>master</b> <b>meter</b> or weigh scale.|$|E
40|$|Jakarta is a {{city with}} {{unpredictable}} yet annual water shortages, both during the dry and wet season, which disproportionately affect the urban poor. One possible solution is to redevelop the existing water supply system which is now working {{in one of the}} largest slum area in Penjaringan, North Jakarta. This system is equipped with a large meter, the <b>Master</b> <b>Meter,</b> to record the communal water consumption and individual meters to record household consumptions. The Community Based Organization uses, operates, and maintains the system based on agreement with water users. Improvement of the <b>Master</b> <b>Meter</b> is achieved by harvesting uncollected rain water during the wet season with its high rainfall intensity, modifying the water storage system and improving the influent water quality. This paper aims to provide a preventive strategy in response to climate change and infrastructural failures based on a case study of community-based water supply project in Penjaringan, Jakarta...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{ecological}} footprint of households and mitigate anthropogenic climate change, policy makers need to understand which incentives drive household energy consumption. Economists tend to rely solely on financial instruments, but these might have unintended consequences on energy consumption through 'non-economic' channels. According to what we call the Hackett-Lutzenhiser hypothesis, the relation between households' cultural background and their energy consumption differs under different payment structures. The electricity consumption of households in the Netherlands is categorized according to two different payment structures: unit metered, where households pay for their private electricity consumption and <b>master</b> <b>metered,</b> where electricity costs are lump sum included in the rent. Our findings show that the range of variation in electricity consumption across cultural backgrounds is lower among unit <b>metered</b> than among <b>master</b> <b>metered</b> households, in line with the Hackett-Lutzenhiser hypothesis. The policy implication is that consumers' preferences cannot be simply taken as given, as is customary in standard economic models, but interact with the structure of financial incentives. Taxes and subsidies, or fixed and flexible rates in energy bills, not only change relative prices but may also interact with people's preferences...|$|R
2500|$|The private {{companies}} have specifically attempted {{to improve the}} supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. However, these attempts have been fairly limited. For example, Palyja has installed so-called <b>Master</b> <b>Meters,</b> from which residents in communities can connect themselves {{with the assistance of}} NGOs such as Mercy Corps. As of 2012, however, there were only 3 <b>Master</b> <b>Meters,</b> one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. The <b>Master</b> <b>Meters</b> provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. Piped connections were also expanded. One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an output-based aid grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a [...] "mafia" [...] of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials.|$|R

Nearly all of the public parking in the county is metered, or charged by a daily flat rate, common with parking garages. Nearly all single parking meters {{in the region have}} been removed and replaced with <b>master</b> <b>meters</b> that accept both cash and credit card. The Miami Parking Authority operates 11 garages, 86 surface lots, and over 9,100 public parking spaces within the approximately [...] city of Miami; adding to over 30,000 parking spaces in total. They enforce the streetside and surface lot parking meters and issue parking citations for violations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is methodologiesto {{estimate}} water loss in public watersupply systems in Florida as part of a water conservation plan. Urban water origi-nates at one or more sources, is transported to one or more treatment plants, is treated and distributed to customers throughout the water system, and then is used by the customer. The amount of water moving through the urban water system is measured at the source(s), the treatment plant(s), and the de-livery points to the customer. The frequency of measurement varies from hourly or daily at the <b>master</b> <b>meters</b> located at the source(s) and treatment plant(s) to typically monthly read-ings of customer water use. A portion of the water moving through this systemmay be lost or gained as measured by differences in meter readings. This paper addresses only losses or gains in the distribu-tion/transmission network. Because water is transported through this network under pres-sure, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that only losses will occur. If a gain occurs, it is caused by meter errors. By contrast, wastewater collec-tion networks typically experience gains in flows because of infiltration and inflow. This study was initiated as part of activi-ties of the Conserve Florida Water Clearing-house (www. conservefloridawater. org). Water loss is a required input to the Guide software that is used to evaluate water conservation pro-grams in Florida. A detailed description of the Guide is available at the Clearinghouse web site. The current version of the Guide allows the user to select from several options for esti-mating water loss. Questions arose as to the sources of variability in these methods and whether one method is preferable to others.

It relied on a very sensitive <b>master</b> gas <b>meter</b> equipped with a pulse meter, data logger, and software. The procedure involves two steps: decomposition and identification of the end uses. The technique is about 95 % accurate but the algorithms can still be confused by some relatively common situations. Further improvements in the software are expected to improve accuracy. The procedure was applied to over 600 homes in Tokyo, Japan. The aggregate data allow more accurate estimates of energy consumption by the major residential gas appliances {{in addition to their}} hourly load profiles. Key factors affecting energy demand by each gas appliance were obtained by combining the energy and demographic data. These data are essential for more accurate forecasting of gas consumption, system sizing, and other marketing activities. The system will not necessarily be as successful in America due to the presence of pilot lights, more appliances per household, and variable-rate gas appliances.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{research conducted}} towards {{the development of}} an objective model that predicts punch in musical signals. Punch is a term often used by engineers and producers when describing a particular perceptual sensation found in produced music. Music is often characterised by listeners as being punchier yet the term is subjective, in terms of its meaning and the subsequent auditory effect on the listener. An objective model of punch would therefore prove useful for both music classification purposes and as a possible further metric that could be employed in music production and <b>mastering</b> <b>metering</b> tools. The literature reviewed within this body of work encompasses both subjective and objective audio evaluation methods in addition to low-level signal extraction and measurement techniques. The review concludes that whilst there has {{been a great deal of}} work in the area of semantic description and audio quality measurement, low-level analysis with respect to the perception of punch remains largely unexplored. The project was completed in a number of phases each designed to investigate the perceptual effects resulting from manipulation of test stimuli. The rationale behind this testing was to establish the key low-level descriptors relating to the punch attribute with the aim of producing a final objective and perceptually based model. The listening tests in each phase were conducted according to the ITU-R BS 1534 - 1 recommendation. In producing an objective model for the prediction of punch, listener perception to the attribute shows a strong correlation to the signal onset times, octave frequency band, signal duration and dynamic range. The punch measure obtained using the model is named PM 95, where 95 indicates the upper percentile used in the measurement. Secondary measures were also obtained as a result of the iterative approach adopted. These are Inter-Band-Ratio (IBR), Transient to Steady-state Ratio (TSR) and Transient to Steady-state Ratio+Residual (TSR+R). These measures are useful in quantifying overall audio quality with respect to its dynamic range across frequency bands in addition to being a more reliable metric for defining the overall compression being applied to a piece of music. In addition, the latter two measures proposed may be useful in highlighting perceptual masking artefacts. The completed perceptual punch model was validated using the scores obtained from a large scale and independently conducted forced pairwise comparison test using expert listeners and a wide range of musical stimuli. From the results obtained, the PM 95 measure showed a ‘very strong’ positive correlation with listener punch perception. Both r and rho coefficients (0. 849 and 0. 833) being significant at the 0. 01 level (2 -tailed). The PM 95 M measure, which is the PM 95 measure divided by the mean value of punch frames also correlated very well with the perceptual punch scale having both r and rho coefficients (0. 707 and - 0. 750) being significant at the 0. 05 level (2 -tailed). A real-time implementation of the punch model (and other measures proposed in this thesis) could be utilised as extensions to the metrics currently being used in Music Information Retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. A flutter {{analysis}} of the new prototype 18 -meter glass glider, the JS 1 Revelation, was performed. The analysis was conducted in two main parts, a modal analysis done by a ground vibration test, followed by a flutter prediction. A ground vibration test {{was performed on the}} glider in two configurations: with no water ballast and with water ballast in the wings. For each of these cases the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd symmetric and anti-symmetric wing bending modes and wing torsion modes were extracted as well as fin, stabilizer and fuselage modes. All of these modes were extracted in the frequency range 1 Hz - 32 Hz. The natural frequency, modal damping and mode shape of each mode are among the modal results. The flutter prediction was done with the software code SAF (Subsonic Aerodynamic Flutter). SAF makes use of a panel model of the glider and utilized the doublet lattice method and p-k flutter solution method. So far, results in the form of damping vs. velocity and frequency vs. velocity graphs indicated stability of main surface modes in the velocity range up to 1. 2 VD up to an altitude of 8000 <b>meters.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
