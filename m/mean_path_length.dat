5000|$|The {{shortcut}} {{model is}} useful for studying the dimension dependence of different processes. The processes studied include the behaviour of the power law potential {{as a function of}} the dimension, the behaviour of self-avoiding random walks, and the scaling of the <b>mean</b> <b>path</b> <b>length.</b> It may be useful to compare the shortcut model with the small-world network, since the definitions have a lot of similarity. In the small-world network also one starts with a regular lattice and adds shortcuts with probability [...] However, the shortcuts are not constrained to connect to a node a fixed distance ahead. Instead, the other end of the shortcut can connect to any randomly chosen node. As a result, the small world model tends to a random graph rather than a two-dimensional graph as the shortcut probability is increased.|$|E
50|$|Kåre Bremer, using rbcL {{sequences}} and the <b>mean</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> {{method for}} estimating divergence times, estimated {{the age of}} the monocot crown group (i.e. the time at which the ancestor of today's Acorus diverged {{from the rest of the}} group) as 134 million years. Similarly, Wikström et al., using Sanderson's non-parametric rate smoothing approach, obtained ages of 127-141 million years for the crown group of monocots. All these estimates have large error ranges (usually 15-20%), and Wikström et al. used only a single calibration point, namely the split between Fagales and Cucurbitales, which was set to 84 Ma, in the late Santonian period. Early molecular clock studies using strict clock models had estimated the monocot crown age to 200 ± 20 million years ago or 160 ± 16 million years, while studies using relaxed clocks have obtained 135-131 million years or 133.8 to 124 million years. Bremer's estimate of 134 million years has been used as a secondary calibration point in other analyses. Some estimates place the emergence of the monocots as far back as 150 mya in the Jurassic period.|$|E

25|$|The {{validity}} of the continuum assumption {{is dependent on the}} density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the <b>mean</b> free <b>path</b> <b>length</b> must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the <b>mean</b> free <b>path</b> <b>length</b> is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the <b>mean</b> free <b>path</b> <b>length.</b> For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000ft/90km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit. In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.|$|R

The study shows that the performance of this type of network topology is desirable and is comparable to other types of multihop systems. It may be considered as a candidate for optical Metropolitan Area Networks. The optical implementation and design criteria are also discussed in the thesis. It shows that such networks are feasible with today's lightwave technology and can also be easily adapted to the more advanced technique in the future...|$|E

40|$|A self-consistent model {{describing}} the interstellar propagation of Galactic cosmic radiation is developed using low-energy {{measurements and calculations}} {{of the effects of}} interstellar propagation and solar modulation. The source ratio H- 1 /He- 4 at constant energy per nucleon is determined to be 12. 2 + or - 1. 5, and the <b>mean</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> for an exponential path length weighting function required to account for the data is 7. 2 + or - 1. 0 g/sq cm. The measured H- 2 /He- 4 and He- 3 /He- 4 ratios do not vary by more than about 30 percent over the solar cycle. The behavior of the ratios during the solar cycle reflects the energy dependence of the local interstellar ratios, and leads to an energy dependence of the <b>mean</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> below 1 GeV per nucleon weaker than that inferred from boron/carbon.

40|$|Abstract—The attack graph is an {{abstraction}} that reveals the ways an attacker can leverage vulnerabilities {{in a network}} to violate a security policy. When used with attack graph-based security metrics, the attack graph {{may be used to}} quantitatively assess securityrelevant aspects of a network. The Shortest Path metric, the Number of Paths metric, and the <b>Mean</b> of <b>Path</b> <b>Lengths</b> metric are three attack graph-based security metrics that can extract security-relevant information. However, one’s usage of these metrics can lead to misleading results. The Shortest Path metric and the <b>Mean</b> of <b>Path</b> <b>Lengths</b> metric fail to adequately account for the number of ways an attacker may violate a security policy. The Number of Paths metric fails to adequately account for the attack effort associated with the attack paths. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a complimentary suite of attack graph-based security metrics and specify an algorithm for combining the usage of these metrics. We present simulated results that suggest that our approach reaches a conclusion about which of two attack graphs correspond to a network that is most secure in many instances.
