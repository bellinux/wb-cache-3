5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the <b>misstatements.</b> Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of <b>misstatements</b> made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} difference with paper based assurance {{is the concept}} of material <b>misstatement.</b> Material <b>misstatement</b> concerns the accuracy of the audit opinion on a financial statement or filing as a whole. An XBRL report contains a collection of individually identifiable business facts. The facts are building blocks of an XBRL report. Material <b>misstatement</b> in an XBRL report concerns the individually identifiable business facts.|$|R

40|$|Auditing {{standards}} direct auditors {{to consider}} business risk and {{other risk factors}} when they evaluate the overall risk of material <b>misstatement</b> during the planning phase of an audit. Large audit firms generally use either a strategic-systems approach (SSA) or a transaction-focused approach (TFA) to evaluate <b>misstatement</b> risk. This study used data from a laboratory experiment to examine whether (1) being trained to use either SSA or TFA and (2) analyzing information organized in an SSA or TFA format influence {{the extent to which}} auditors integrate knowledge of business risk into their judgment about the likelihood of financial <b>misstatement.</b> Only auditors trained to use SSA who analyzed information provided in an SSA format effectively integrated business risk assessments with their assessment of the risk of material <b>misstatement.</b> ...|$|R

The joint program of the WAA and AF of L was said to include payment of union scale for all skilled workers, a minimum payment of $30 per week for all workers on relief, and provision for collective bargaining for all workers on work-relief projects.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scaliger had made {{numerous}} enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, {{and most of}} all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness , he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the <b>misstatements</b> of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} firms' values and accounting numbers for 72 firms that adopted fresh start reporting (FSR) upon their emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It focuses {{on the effects of}} a <b>misstatement</b> in the reporting choice of the initial fresh start value of equity on the association between firms' values and accounting numbers reported subsequently. Using a security valuation model, I derive an explicit relation between firms' values and a measure of the <b>misstatement</b> in the fresh start equity. This model provides a theoretical value for a coefficient associating the <b>misstatement</b> with firms' values under the null hypothesis that investors accurately undo the effects of the <b>misstatement</b> on subsequently reported numbers. I estimate this model for eight quarters after the adoption of FSR. The results of the regressions suggest that even two years after the emergence from Chapter 11 and the adoption of FSR, investors unravel the effects of the initial <b>misstatement</b> on book values and earnings reported subsequent to the adoption of FSR. The results also suggest that while investors appear to adjust for these effects, the magnitude of the adjustment is constant over time (in contrast to the predicted pattern of this adjustment). 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} certain audit committee characteristics identified by the Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees (BRC) on the likelihood of financial <b>misstatement.</b> We examine 83 firms which misstated financial reports in the period 1991 - 1999, together with a matched pairs control group of similar size. We find that independence of the committee is significantly negatively related to <b>misstatement,</b> but {{that the size of}} the committee and the financial expertise of the audit committee members are not significant. We use a preliminary proxy (number of meetings) to represent the extent of audit committee compliance with BRC recommendations related to committee activities. This proxy is significantly, negatively related to <b>misstatement.</b> We also find, in contrast to Beasley (1996), that the characteristics of the overall committee (independence, director tenure and outside directorships, shareholdings and board size) are not related to financial <b>misstatement.</b> 1 Introductio...|$|R

500|$|A 2011 {{biography}} by Pearlman {{describes a}} tumultuous personal life {{very different from}} his positive public image. According to Pearlman's biography, Payton was a consistent adulterer, and a multiple drug user. His drug use began with painkillers provided {{to him by the}} Bears to cope with the punishment he absorbed during games, and continued after his football career ended. Payton did not cope well with life after his career, especially with issues of boredom and loneliness. His wife and family contend that the book is filled with factual <b>misstatements,</b> and paints too bleak a picture of his life. However, many reviewers of Pearlman's work have found it to have been [...] "exhaustively" [...] researched and documented by hundreds of interviews.

500|$|With the Cabinet still {{divided between}} adherents of Green and Harkness, Diefenbaker {{made a speech}} in the Commons on January 25 that Fleming (by then Minister of Justice) termed [...] "a model of obfuscation". Harkness was {{initially}} convinced that Diefenbaker was saying that he would support nuclear warheads in Canada. After talking to the press, he realized that {{his view of the}} speech was not universally shared, and he asked Diefenbaker for clarification. Diefenbaker, however, continued to try to avoid taking a firm position. On January 30, the US State Department issued a press release suggesting that Diefenbaker had made <b>misstatements</b> in his Commons speech. For the first time ever, Canada recalled its ambassador to Washington as a diplomatic protest. Though all parties condemned the State Department action, the three parties outside the government demanded that Diefenbaker take a stand on the nuclear weapon issue.|$|E
500|$|On 23 June 2008, Winehouse's {{publicist}} corrected earlier <b>misstatements</b> by Mitch Winehouse {{that his}} daughter had early stage emphysema, instead claiming she had signs of what could lead to early-stage emphysema. Mitch Winehouse had also stated {{that his daughter}}'s lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity {{and that she had}} an irregular heartbeat. He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine. The singer's father also reported that doctors had warned Winehouse that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die. In a radio interview, Mitch Winehouse said the singer was responding [...] "fabulously" [...] to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches. British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted this type of condition could be managed with treatment. Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but [...] "heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely." [...] Norman H. Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would lead to a more rapid decline in lung function.|$|E
