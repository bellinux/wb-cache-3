5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
5|$|Terrorism <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> {{affected}} the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games {{were held in}} Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September {{in what is now}} known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five terrorists also perished.|$|E

5|$|The Terminator and the T-1000 {{converge}} on John {{in a shopping}} mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah {{in order to get}} to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity. Sarah learns that the man <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will form the basis for Skynet.|$|E
5|$|Nasmyth {{was also}} a highly {{influential}} teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included Andrew Wilson (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist Hugh William Williams (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845). Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work Fast Castle from Below (1824). Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of Walter Scott. Knox's Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that {{grew up in the}} Trossachs {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake in 1810. He {{was also a}}mong the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow. Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works of the views from the top of Ben Lomond, which played a part in opening up the Highlands as a spectacle that would be taken up by artists in the second half of the century.|$|E

Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are thought to <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> target the etiology of NMDA neurotoxicity. Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, and muscimol.|$|E

Richard Mulcahy became a leader of Fine Gael in 1948, but never became Taoiseach because of his role in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Prices and {{quantities}} {{have been}} described as the <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to David Courtemanche, two incumbent councillors were also defeated — notably, both represented wards {{outside of the}} pre-2001 city boundaries, and hence may have been vulnerable {{in part because of}} the amalgamation referendum controversy. The councillors whose wards were <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> affected by the Kingsway, Lily Creek and South End sewer tunnel controversies were all re-elected. Two wards, both in the old city, had no incumbent councillor running for reelection.|$|E

25|$|While the Louisville riots of 1968 {{had many}} causes (<b>most</b> <b>directly,</b> {{the spread of}} false rumors and bottles being thrown into the crowd) the crowd where the riot began had {{gathered}} to protest the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. As the crowd became unruly, police attempts to disperse it were ineffective, {{but this was a}} common problem police departments of the day had.|$|E

25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>directly,</b> {{criticism}} of communism was not tolerated. This included any criticisms {{of communism in}} general, as well as discussion of the contemporary regimes of the GDR and the Soviet Union, and usually of other Soviet-allied states. It also included discussion of the Stasi's activities and methods. Similarly, ideas which were sympathetic of capitalism or fascism, which were seen as the two enemies of communism, were not allowed. Any idea which encouraged resistance to the government, such as conscientious objection, {{was not to be}} discussed.|$|E

This force served in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, driving out the Confederate force in the Arizona Territory and defending New Mexico Territory and the southern overland route to California and operating against the Apache, Navajo, Comanche and other tribes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{few of the}} new administration's {{programs}} succeeded. Major {{difficulties with}} the stabilization and reform programs were caused {{in part by the}} superficial nature of many of the administration's actions and by its inability to secure political support. Moreover, the stabilization plan failed because of management errors coupled with defensive actions by segments of society that would be <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> hurt by the plan. Confidence in the government was also eroded {{as a result of the}} liquidity freeze combined with an alienated industrial sector who had not been consulted in the plan.|$|E

25|$|Computer {{operating}} systems provide {{different levels of}} access to resources. A protection ring {{is one of two}} or more hierarchical levels or layers of privilege within the architecture of a computer system. This is generally hardware-enforced by some CPU architectures that provide different CPU modes at the hardware or microcode level. Rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most privileged (most trusted, usually numbered zero) to least privileged (least trusted, usually with the highest ring number). On most {{operating systems}}, Ring 0 is the level with the most privileges and interacts <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> with the physical hardware such as the CPU and memory.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1651, the English {{government}} {{had sought to}} regulate trade in the American colonies. On October 9, the Navigation Acts were passed to ensure that trade enriched only Britain, barring trade with other nations. Some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists, but the political friction which the acts triggered was more serious, as the merchants <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> affected were most politically active. King Philip's War ended in 1678, {{and much of it}} was fought without significant assistance from England. This contributed {{to the development of a}} unique identity, separate from that of Britain.|$|E
25|$|Japanese hip hop (also {{known as}} J-rap, J-hip hop or J-hop) {{is said to}} have begun when Hiroshi Fujiwara {{returned}} to Japan and started playing hip hop records in the early 1980s. Japanese hip hop generally tends to be <b>most</b> <b>directly</b> influenced by old school hip hop, taking from the era's catchy beats, dance culture, and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. As a result, hip hop stands {{as one of the most}} commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan, and the line between it and pop music is frequently blurred.|$|E
