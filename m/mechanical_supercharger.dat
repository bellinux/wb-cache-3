40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} and optimization of a SI high performance engine, {{to be used in}} Formula SAE/Student competitions. The base engine is a single cylinder Yamaha 660 cc motorcycle unit, rated at about 48 HP at 6000 rpm. Besides the reduction of engine capacity to 600 cc and the mounting of the required restrictor, <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharging</b> has been adopted in order to boost performance. The fluid-dynamic optimization of the engine system has been performed by means of 1 D-CFD simulation, coupled to a single-objective genetic algorithm, developed by the authors. The optimization results have been compared to the ones obtained by a well known commercial optimization software, finding a good agreement. Experiments at the brake dynamometer have been carried out, in order to support engine modeling and to demonstrate the reliability of the optimization proces...|$|R
50|$|Design {{of a new}} Allison V-1710-E9 {{was also}} underway. This version, which had the {{military}} designation of V-1710-47, used a two-stage <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> to increase the engine power at altitude. However, this engine went through so many design changes that it ended up being almost identical to the later V-1710-93 which was fitted in the XP-63A.|$|E
50|$|The Allison V-1710 was {{the only}} {{indigenous}} U.S.-developed V12 liquid-cooled engine to see service during World War II. A sturdy design, it lacked an advanced <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> until 1943. Although versions with a turbosupercharger provided excellent performance at high altitude in the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the turbosupercharger and its ductwork were too bulky to fit into typical single-engine fighters. While a good performer at low altitudes, without adequate supercharging, the Allison's high-altitude performance was lacking.|$|E
5000|$|The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row {{air-cooled}} radial engine. Each row {{of seven}} air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's [...] "corncob" [...] nickname. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 {{so that the}} tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.|$|E
40|$|Supercharging is an {{effective}} method, which increases power and torque of combustion engines. Supercharging means, that the inlet air is compressed and pushed into the engine chambers. Compressed air has higher density, so more fuel could be added. Supercharged engine has better fuel consumption and produce lower emisions then naturaly aspired engine with the same power. The air could be compressed by a gas driven turbocharger or a <b>mechanical</b> driven <b>supercharger.</b> These devices and their modifications are described in this book...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the technical approach for converting a Caterpillar 3406 natural gas spark ignited engine into HCCI mode. The paper describes {{all stages of}} the process, starting with a preliminary analysis that determined that the engine can be operated by preheating the intake air with a heat exchanger that recovers energy from the exhaust gases. This heat exchanger plays a dual role, since it is also used for starting the engine. For start-up, the heat exchanger is preheated with a natural gas burner. The engine is therefore started in HCCI mode, avoiding the need to handle the potentially difficult transition from SI or diesel mode to HCCI. The fueling system was modified by replacing the natural gas carburetor with a liquid petroleum gas (LPG) carburetor. This modification sets an upper limit for the equivalence ratio at {phi} {approx} 0. 4, which is ideal for HCCI operation and guarantees that the engine will not fail due to knock. Equivalence ratio can be reduced below 0. 4 for low load operation with an electronic control valve. Intake boosting has been a challenge, as commercially available turbochargers are not a good match for the engine, due to the low HCCI exhaust temperature. Commercial introduction of HCCI engines for stationary power will therefore require the development of turbochargers designed specifically for this mode of operation. Considering that no appropriate off-the-shelf turbocharger for HCCI engines exists at this time, we are investigating <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharging</b> options, which will deliver the required boost pressure (3 bar absolute intake) {{at the expense of}} some reduction in the output power and efficiency. An appropriate turbocharger can later be installed for improved performance when it becomes available or when a custom turbocharger is developed. The engine is now running in HCCI mode and producing power in an essentially naturally aspirated mode. Current work focuses on developing an automatic controller for obtaining consistent combustion in the 6 cylinders. The engine will then be tested for 1000 hours to demonstrate durability. This paper presents intermediate progress towards development of an HCCI engine for stationary power generation and next steps towards achieving the project goals...|$|R
40|$|We study compactified pure gauge/gravitational {{theories}} with gauge-fixing {{terms and}} show that these theories possess quantum mechanical SUSY-like symmetries between unphysical degrees of freedom. These residual symmetries are global symmetries and generated by quantum <b>mechanical</b> N= 2 <b>supercharges.</b> Also, we establish new one-parameter family of gauge choices for higher-dimensional gravity, and calculate as a check of its validity one graviton exchange amplitude in the lowest tree-level approximation. We confirm that the result is indeed ξ-independent and the cancellation of the ξ-dependence is ensured by the residual symmetries. We also give a simple interpretation of the vDVZ-discontinuity, which arises in the lowest tree-level approximation, from the supersymmetric point of view. Comment: REVTeX 4, 17 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1942, the {{increasing}} number of USAAF bombing raids and intelligence coming in about the new American B-29 bomber led the Luftwaffe to envisage a pressing need for an effective high-altitude interceptor. Messerschmitt adapted the Me 155 design again to meet this requirement, merging the design with an in-house study originally designated Me 409, then later Bf 109ST; the new aircraft received the designation Me 155B. The engine was to be the DB 628, which was basically a DB 605A with a two-stage <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> with an induction cooler. A pressurized cabin was to be provided. It was estimated that a service ceiling of 14,097 m (46,250 ft) could be attained.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier {{the same}} year Nowkuński created the GR-760 high-efficiency {{air-cooled}} radial engine. [...] Used {{in a number of}} sports planes (notably the RWD 9), the engine won the Challenge International de Tourisme 1934 {{and a number of other}} tournaments. When tasked with designing a larger, more powerful engine for warplanes, Nowkuński decided to study the Farman 12bis and Ranger V-770 V engines. His new design, the Foka (Polish for seal) drew from both Nowkuński's earlier designs and the promising French and American constructions of the epoch. Similar to Ranger V-770, Foka had only 8 cylinders in an inverted-V configuration and also featured a reduction drive and <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> allowing for up to [...] at 4000 revolutions.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{before the}} Nomad I was running, its successor, the Nomad II (E.145) Nomad 6, {{had already been}} designed. In this version an extra stage {{was added to the}} axial compressor/supercharger, {{eliminating}} the separate centrifugal part and the intercooler. The turbine (which also received an additional stage) was now only used to drive the compressor, and feed back any excess power to the main shaft using a hydraulic clutch; the separate propeller from the turbine was deleted, just as the whole of the [...] "afterburner" [...] system with its valves etc. So the system was now like a combination of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger,</b> and a turbocharger without any need for bypass. The result was smaller and considerably simpler: a single engine driving a single propeller. Overall about 1000 lb was taken off the weight. The wet liners of the cylinders of the Nomad I were changed for dry liners.While the Nomad II was undergoing testing, a prototype Avro Shackleton was lent to Napier as a testbed. The engine proved bulky, like the Nomad I before it, and in the meantime several dummy engines were used on the Shackleton for various tests.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{turbocharging}} and supercharging an engine {{is referred to}} as twincharging. The Delta S4 was the first such example of this technology. Contemporary turbochargers were inefficient, as they did not produce boost at low RPMs. This phenomenon, known as turbo lag, negatively affects driveability, an important aspect of a rally car. Superchargers do not suffer from lag as they are powered directly from the engine's crankshaft, rather than by the exhaust gases. However, because of this direct <b>mechanical</b> connection, the <b>supercharger</b> presents a significant parasitic load to the engine at higher RPMs. Lancia designed their twincharger system so the supercharger provides instantaneous boost in the lower RPM range, switching to the turbocharger for more efficient higher RPM engine operation.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian 1931 Schneider Trophy entrant, the Macchi M.C.72, {{required}} an engine of 2,300 horsepower (1,700 kW) with {{the capability of}} producing up to 2,800 horsepower (2,090 kW) while having a weight of not more than 840 kilograms (1,850 lb). The contract was awarded to Fiat, but as their most powerful V engine to that date was the 1,000-horsepower (750 kW) 12-cylinder Fiat AS.5 that had also been used for Schneider Trophy racing, the company faced a difficult challenge. The novel solution was to couple two AS.5 V12 engines in tandem to produce a V-24 with each engine independently driving one {{of a pair of}} contra-rotating propellers through co-axial shafts. Except for sharing a common <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger,</b> the unit was more a [...] "tandem V12" [...] than a true V24, which would require all cylinders to power a single crankshaft, rather than dual crankshafts rotating in opposite directions with independent crank and driveshafts, or at least to have both cranks geared together to drive a single output. The rear engine drove the front propeller through a reduction gearbox, located between the two engines, up to a shaft that passed between the cylinder banks of the reverse-mounted forward engine. The latter's crankshaft drive faced rearwards and drove the rearmost propeller in a likewise manner, but instead via a hollow shaft passing between the cylinder banks through which the rear engine driveshaft passed. [...] A large rear-mounted mechanical centrifugal supercharger was used to boost the engine, with the fuel/air mixture being delivered to the cylinders through a manifold that was centrally mounted between the cylinder banks of both engines.|$|E
40|$|To ensure many {{production}} processes are used compressors of various types, including turbochargers, which produce compressed air. The actual performance values of turbochargers used in highlands are {{significantly different from}} the certified values, and parameters of compressed air do not always guarantee the smooth and efficient functioning for consumers. The paper presents research results of the turbochargers of 4 CI 425 MX 4 type, a series of "CENTAC", manufactured by INGERSOL – RAND Company. The research has been conducted in industrial highland conditions in difficult climatic environment. There were almost no investigations of turbochargers running in highland conditions. The combination of low atmospheric pressure with high temperature of the intake air causes the abnormal operating conditions of a turbocharger. Only N. M. Barannikov in his paper shows the results of theoretical studies of such operating conditions, but as to the practical research, there is no information at all. To normalize the turbocharger operation an option of the mechanical pressurization in the suction pipe is adopted. As a result of theoretical research, a TurboMAX blower MAX 500 was chosen as a supercharger. The next stage of theoretical research was to construct characteristics of the turbocharger 4 CI 425 MX 4 with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>supercharger</b> in the suction pipe. The boost reduces to the minimum the time of using additional compressors when parameters of the intake air are changed and ensures the smooth and efficient functioning for consumers. To verify the results of theoretical studies, namely, the technique for recalculation of the turbocharger characteristics under the real conditions of suction, were carried out the experimental researches. The average error between experimental and theoretical data is 2, 9783 %, which confirms the validity of the technique used for reduction of the turbocharger characteristics to those under the real conditions of suction. </p...|$|E
