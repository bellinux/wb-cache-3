Histological review performed by a reference pathologist left 99 cases for study; 84 cases and 2070 population controls were interviewed. The industries most closely associated (a twofold or more odds ratio [OR]) with SBC taking into account a 10 -year time lag after exposure were, among women, employment in wholesale industry of food and beverages (OR, 8. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], [1. 9 to 34. 9]) and among men, <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> bodies (OR, 5. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 22. 4), footwear (OR, 3. 9 : 95 % CI, 0. 9 to 16. 1), and metal structures (OR, 3. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 0 to 10. 4).

The Herfindahl–Hirschman market concentration index indicates that Turkey diversified its export market by exchanging with different countries so as to not to concentrate solely on a few markets. Conversely, Sakarya has increased its diversification in export markets since 2011 to mitigate the negative impacts of the global crisis and corresponding decreases in European demand. The Herfindahl–Hirchman product concentration index shows that diversification in Turkey’s export sectors and products increased considerably between 2002 and 2014. The study also shows that the dependency of Turkey’s export pattern on the automotive sector is very low, and that exported sectors and products are well-diversified. In contrast, export product diversification in Sakarya has remained at almost {{at the same level}} during the same period.

In the period 2001 - 2010 the industry was faced with significant inputs of foreign direct investments {{that have led to}} stimulating the development of the economy. This paper examines the efficiency an d productivity of enterprises (more than 250 employees) in machinery industry which are part of a emerging markets. In the machinery industry there are companies that deal with the cars manufacture, machinery and equipment and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their components. Techniques selected for evaluation of progress efficiency and changing productivity studied are Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). This methodology allows a direct comparison between firms within t he same industry and shows how intense inputs are used in a production system from which we want to realize a high level of output. The used program to calculate indicators of productivity and efficiency frontier was DEAP 2. 1. (Data Envelopment Analysis Computer) developed by the Centre for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis of the University of New England. Analysis of positive or negative trends in the efficiency and productivity of enterprises in the studied period reveals information about the sources of existing inefficient. This paper is mainly aimed at measuring the technical efficiency and productivity change in the machinery industry in Romania between 2001 - 2010 and as secondary objective to determine the inefficient sources in industry.

This study aimed to identify occupational clustering of cases SBA as a systematic approach to new hypotheses on the aetiology of this disease.  METHODS—A European multicentre case-control study was conducted in 1995 - 7, inclusive. Incident cases aged 35 - 69 years with SBA (n= 168) were recruited before acceptance by a pathologist. Altogether 107  cases and 3915  controls were accepted, of which 79  cases, 579  colon cancer controls, and 2070  population controls were interviewed.  RESULTS—The strongest industrial risk factors for SBA taking account of 10  years' exposure lag were dry cleaning, manufacture of workwear, mixed farming (women), and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> (men). A significantly increased risk of SBA (odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)) was found among men employed as building caretakers, OR 6. 7  (1. 7  to 26. 0) and women employed as housekeepers, OR 2. 2  (1. 1  to 4. 9); general farm labourers, OR 4. 7  (1. 8  to 12. 2); dockers, OR 2. 9  (1. 0  to 8. 2); dry cleaners or launderers, OR 4. 1  (1. 2  to 13. 6); and textile workers (sewers or embroiders), OR 2. 6  (1. 0  to 6. 8). For the last four groups, together with welders OR 2. 7  (1. 1  to 6. 6) (men) an exposure-response pattern was found when calculating the ORs for jobs held 1 - 5 years and > 5 years, with never having held the job as reference. The ORs (95 % CIs) for 1 - 5 years and > 5 years were 4. 3  (0. 4  to 44. 0) and 3. 5  (0. 9  to 13. 7), 3. 0  (0. 3  to 26. 2) and 4. 3  (0. 9  to 21. 2), 4. 6  (0. 4  to 48. 1) and 11. 0  (2. 0  to 60. 4), 1. 3  (0. 2  to 11. 0) and 5. 8  (2. 0  to 17. 2), and 2. 8  (0. 3  to 23. 8) and 4. 6  (1. 3  to 16. 6), respectively, for each of these occupations. Among welders, people performing semiautomatic arc welding (MIG/MAG) were identified as a high risk group (OR 5. 0  (1. 3  to 19. 6)).  CONCLUSIONS—This explorative study suggests an increased occurrence of SBA in certain occupations, which needs further evaluation.    Keywords: small intestine; adenocarcinoma; occupational risk factor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on China Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts (WT/DS 342 /AB/R, 15 December 2008). This dispute {{concerns}} {{a set of}} regulatory measures imposing a 25 % 'charge' on imported automobile parts used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> in China. The main legal question in this case consisted {{of the nature of}} this charge as either a border charge subject to China's tariff concessions or an internal charge, subject to the basic nondiscrimination requirement of GATT Article III. In our report, we examine the reasoning of the Appellate Body relating to the difference between these two types of charges. We discuss the role and relevance of this distinction in the GATT/WTO legal system in general, and for the purposes of resolving this dispute in particular. We also address the important systemic question relating to the review of a Member's domestic laws for purposes of determining their GATT/WTO consistency. This was an important issue in this case, as China claimed that the Panel misunderstood the meaning of the relevant Decree and requested the Appellate Body to review the Panel's erroneous reading of this Decree. We discuss the Appellate Body's reasoning relating to the review of domestic laws by Panels and the Appellate Body and express concern over the distinction drawn by the Appellate Body between legal and factual elements of relevance in the interpretation of such laws. The 'economic bone' in this case is less straightforward to split than the legal one. In legal terms, the Appellate Body's decision is a time-consistent one, but, in economic terms, it is not clear if it is also a welfare-optimal one. The main reason is that many questions relevant to the case were left unaddressed by the Appellate Body. Due to the lack of factual evidence to substantiate its allegations, the Panel's ruling remains rather speculative on certain accounts. For this purpose, we engage in our own examination of the facts, using mainly a unique dataset of Chinese firm-level data. We analyze issues of ownership in China's car industry, the growth of the import-competing Chinese industry over time, the elasticity of the demand for cars, and duty pass-through, etc. The purpose is to verify more closely who 'benefits' and who 'loses' from the Chinese import duty so as to understand the economic incentives involved. In this respect, we attempt to determine whether the economics support the conclusion that China pursued a beggar-thy-neighbor policy in the car-part industry...|$|E

40|$|The image {{segmentation}} algorithm {{is the most}} challenging step and requires more computer processing power than the boundary filtering, and the Cullen et al's method, which used the Cullen et al's method to determine the electrodes tip width automatically in the automotive industry in real time. Spot welding is used extensively in the automotive industry. The quality of an individual spot weld {{is a major concern}} due to the heavy reliance on their use in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The main parameters that control the quality of a spot weld are current, voltage, welding force, welding time, and the quality of welding electrodes. The condition of the welding electrodes plays a major part in determining the quality of a spot weld. For example, excessive electrode wear can occur during the welding process and can cause weakening in the weld nuggets. As the number of welds increases, the electrode tip wears down and so the contact area between electrode tip and work piece increases. In order to determine the quality of the welding electrodes, a machine vision approach is employed, where images of the electrode tips in real time are captured and are processed using various image-processing algorithms. These algorithms can be used to automatically measure the electrode tip width and hence assess the quality of the electrodes tip in real time. The quality of two types of spot welding electrode tips, namely flat-shaped and dome-shaped tips, is assessed here using image processing techniques. For each tip type, a database of 250 images is used to test the performance of the tested algorithms. Also the tip width in these 250 images is determined manually by counting the number of pixels using an image editor such as Microsoft Paint. An excellent agreement is found between these manual and automatic methods. The tip width for an electrode is measured by first grabbing an image showing the electrode. The electrode in the image is then extracted using an {{image segmentation}} algorithm. Then the boundary of the electrode is determined and filtered. The Cullen et aI's method is subsequently applied, which uses the filtered boundary to determine the tip width. A number of image segmentation and boundary filtering algorithms have been used to determine the tip width automatically. For flat tip electrode, the combination of the region growing image segmentation, Minimum Perimeter Polygon, and Cull en et al's techniques was capable of automatically determining the tip width for 250 images with a root mean square error of 7. 5 % of the tip width. For dome-shaped electrodes, the combination of the Snake segmentation algorithm, Fourier transform, and the Cullen et al's method was capable of automatically determining the tip width for 250 images with a root mean square error of 2. 9 % of the tip width. The author has proposed and built an active illumination system that captures a backlit image of the electrode's shadow, this system has different camera with same time then above. The image is then processed using a simple image segmentation method, such as the Canny filtering algorithm to locate the boundary of the electrodes tip. Then the boundary is processed using Minimum-Perimeter Polygon approach and Cull en et aI's method to automatically determine the tip width for 200 experiments images. The proposed system is capable of determining the tip width automatically with a root mean square error of 3. 2 % of the total tip width for flat tips and 3 % for dome tips.
