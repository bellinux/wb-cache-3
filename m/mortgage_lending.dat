Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{building}} societies actively {{compete with}} banks for most consumer banking services, especially <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> and savings accounts, and regulations permit {{up to half}} of their lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages.

Further, in Australia, building societies also compete with retail banks and offer the full range of banking services to consumers.|$|E
25|$|After {{conducting}} {{a research project}} that documented a dramatic decrease in <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> between 1968 and 1972, activists launched the Jamaica Plain Community Investment Plan. The plan called upon local citizens to pledge to move their savings accounts to a local institution that would guarantee to invest that money in mortgages within Jamaica Plain. The plan eventually generated five hundred thousand dollars in pledges. In 1975 a contract was signed with the Jamaica Plain Cooperative Bank to implement the Community Investment plan.|$|E

The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibit {{discrimination on the basis}} of race, sex, or other personal characteristics. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires that financial institutions publicly disclose <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> and application data.

25|$|By 1970, central Jamaica Plain was {{considered}} to be in a state of decline. The intrusion of the Southwest Corridor coupled with and possibly contributing to a decision by Boston banks to cut back <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> (redline) there began a cycle of disinvestment which led to the deterioration of the housing stock, slumlording and abandonment particularly in the central neighborhood along the edges of the corridor. In some cases, homeowners who could not sell {{due to a lack of}} buyer financing simply walked away from older homes along the corridor's periphery. Urban Edge, founded as a non-profit real estate firm in 1974, found it necessary to recruit volunteer tenants to physically take possession of empty properties to prevent vandalism and arson. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the average life span of an abandoned building was approximately one week. Windows were broken, copper plumbing was stripped out, and buildings were torched.|$|E

2500|$|On May 10, 2009, Goldman Sachs {{agreed to}} pay up to $60 million to end an {{investigation}} by the Massachusetts attorney general's office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state. The settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of 714 Massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by Goldman Sachs. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, said it was [...] "pleased to have resolved this matter," [...] and declined to comment further.

2500|$|Instead of {{deploying}} their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting {{mortgage rates}} {{with reference to}} market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead {{of the advantages of}} a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), [...] "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; [...] "... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990s, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour".|$|E

That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders. Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product. In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI). In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.|$|R
2500|$|A {{building}} {{society is a}} financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending.</b> Building societies exist in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, [...] and used to exist in Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They are similar to credit unions in organisation, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, {{the purpose of a}} {{building society}} is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. The term [...] "building society" [...] first arose in the 18th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups.|$|E
2500|$|In verbal negotiations, Feger {{thereafter}} promised [...] "…to {{safeguard the}} Liechtenstein {{character of the}} bank {{both in terms of}} its corporate bodies and the employment of local residents." [...] On 22 March 1956, he submitted a set of regulations specifying that the organisation and business activities of the proposed bank were not to compete with the Landesbank. In response, the government ultimately granted the concession on 4 April 1956, whereby those regulations were deemed {{an integral part of the}} approval. They were binding on Guido Feger as a person and dictated that the bank may accept no savings deposits, conduct no foreign currency exchange and not grant loans (including <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending).</b> Thus in the early years, the bank had to concentrate almost entirely on non-domestic activities. However, in building up its business, VP Bank was able to benefit from the relationships that ATU had already fostered since 1929 with banks, financial intermediaries and private clients in Switzerland and elsewhere abroad.|$|E

[...] In 2012 the Mortgage Banking unit reported net income of $3.3 billion, widely divergent from the previous year's net loss of $2.1 billion. J.D.

2500|$|According to American Enterprise Institute fellow Edward Pinto, Bank of America {{reported}} in 2008 that its CRA portfolio, which constituted 7% of its owned residential mortgages, {{was responsible for}} 29 percent of its losses. He charged that [...] "approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences ... characteristics that indicated high credit risk", yet, per the standards used by the various government agencies to evaluate CRA performance at the time, were not counted as [...] "subprime" [...] because borrower credit worthiness was not considered. Krugman argues that Pinto's category of [...] "other high-risk mortgages" [...] incorrectly includes loans that were not high-risk, that instead were like traditional conforming mortgages. Gene Epstein of Barron's disputed Krugman's claims {{and those of the}} article he cited as erroneous and misleading. Another CRA critic, Joseph Fried, concedes that [...] "some of this CRA subprime lending might have taken place, {{even in the absence of}} CRA. For that reason, the direct impact of CRA on the volume of subprime lending is not certain." [...] A study by the economists, Agarwal, Benmelich, and Bergman, found that banks undergoing CRA-related regulatory exams took additional <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> risk.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mortgage}} valuation will {{be required}} by any mortgage lender {{as a condition of}} obtaining a mortgage loan. [...] The homebuyer may take the option to instruct the same surveyor to carry out a [...] "RICS HomeBuyer Report" [...] or a [...] "RICS Building Survey" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "Structural Survey"), usually at additional cost. [...] When the surveyor is instructed in this combined role, the mortgage valuation is still produced for the lender, and the HomeBuyer Report or Building Survey is additionally prepared for the borrower. [...] This arrangement can avoid the potential conflict of interest where the surveyor has as client both the lender and the borrower in the transaction. [...] Because of the ethics and professional liability division, borrowers should note that the lender's survey is produced solely for the lender and the surveyor will not extend any liability for loss or omission to the borrower. [...] Since reform of the RICS Red Book of valuation practice in recent years, the definition of a mortgage valuation has been deleted. [...] It is now a market valuation which is the same definition given to the valuation in the RICS HomeBuyer Report. [...] Before it was removed from the RICS Red Book the valuation for <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> had different criteria from the market valuation.|$|E
