Therefore only in special cases this distance <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of sets <b>a</b> metric space.|$|R

The usage differs from standing orders, as payment amounts are not fixed and payments need not be periodical (i.e. payments can be of any amount and can be casual or periodic).|$|R
