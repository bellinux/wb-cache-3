5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The rate of supernovae in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Given that the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> has never {{collided}} with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> but has a visible star count of only 1% of the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} {{the nature of the}} <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> as well as the significant Doppler shift.|$|E

5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> However, some <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> was not detectable.|$|E
5|$|Only three <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E

5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E

5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20.

5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E
50|$|From a {{viewpoint}} in the LMC, the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> total {{apparent magnitude}} would be −2.0—over 14 times {{brighter than the}} LMC appears to us on Earth—and it would span about 36° across the sky, the width of over 70 full moons. Furthermore, because of the LMC's high galactic latitude, an observer there would get an oblique view of the entire galaxy, free from the interference of interstellar dust that makes studying in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> plane difficult from Earth. The Small Magellanic Cloud would be about magnitude 0.6, substantially brighter than the LMC appears to us.|$|R
50|$|Further {{efforts to}} see behind the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way’s</b> ZOA {{such as the}} ALFAZOA and ALFALFA surveys {{may be able to}} perform more {{accurate}} measurements and place better constraints on the parameters of the void in the future. The surveys, conducted using the Arecibo radio telescope, will attempt to look for light from distant galaxies that has been redshifted to a wavelength that will stand out in comparison to the noise caused by the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way’s</b> Zone of Avoidance. However, these surveys have limited range in the north-south (declination) direction, due to operation constraints of the Arecibo telescope.|$|R

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
