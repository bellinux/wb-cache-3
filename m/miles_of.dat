5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began.

The last 160 <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total.
