25|$|Visual SourceSafe: Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is {{a source}} control {{software}} package oriented towards small software-development projects. The SourceSafe database is a multi-user, <b>multi-process</b> file-system database, using the Windows file system database primitives to provide locking and sharing support. All versions are multi-user, using SMB (file server) networking. However, with Visual SourceSafe 2005, other client–server modes were added, Lan Booster and VSS Internet (which used HTTP/HTTPS). Visual SourceSafe 6.0 was available as a stand-alone product and was included with Visual Studio 6.0, and other products such as Office Developer Edition. Visual SourceSafe 2005 was available as a stand-alone product and included with the 2005 Team Suite. Team Foundation Server has superseded VSS as Microsoft's recommended platform for source control.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory that}} has been used to explain the {{mechanisms}} of prospective memory is the <b>multi-process</b> model proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005). This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active monitoring process but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval.|$|E
25|$|A <b>multi-process</b> {{architecture}} is implemented in Chrome where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed process isolation, and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully {{gaining access to}} one application gains access to no others, and failure in one instance results in a Sad Tab screen of death, similar to the well-known Sad Mac, but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat over time as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations. This architecture was adopted in Safari and Firefox.|$|E

This often turns transactions into distributed ones, if they themselves need to span <b>multi-processes.</b> In these cases most local concurrency control techniques do not scale well.|$|R

Purpose: The present study examines the association between social constraints and depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors, and the mechanism underling this association. A <b>multi-processes</b> model is tested to examine the mediating roles of ambivalence over emotional expression (AEE), avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support in the association between social constraints and depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors. Methods: Ninety-six Chinese American breast cancer survivors were recruited from Chinese community organizations. They {{were asked to complete}} a questionnaire package that assessed social constraints, AEE, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, social support, depressive symptoms, and demographic information. Path analysis was conducted to test the hypothesized model. Results: The overall and specific indirect effects of social constraints on depressive symptoms through AEE, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support are significant. When the mediators are controlled for, the direct effect of social constraints on depressive symptoms is no longer significant. Conclusions: A <b>multi-processes</b> model of social constraints and depressive symptoms is tested in a sample of Chinese American breast cancer survivors. The findings suggest that the existence of multiple pathways, through which social constraints may associate with depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors.

40|$|Introduction As part of Alvey project IKBS 90, a {{software}} architecture {{has been developed}} that couples a concurrent logic programming or CLP engine with a multi-threaded Prolog engine. Concurrency among mutually invoking Prolog and CLP computations is sustained partly through and-parallel execution of CLP computations on the CLP engine, and partly by executing multiple Prolog processes and a CLP engine under Unix on a multi-processor or a uni-processor. Communication among the multiple computations is realised by message passing, enabling the architecture to be <b>multi-processed</b> with a low degree of contention for shared memory. The coupled architecture supports multi-user knowledge based systems without compromising on the expressive power and performance of Prolog and CLP languages, and without diminishing the capacity for multiprocessing at a task apposite grain of parallelism.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} interface of NUClear, a new hybrid message-passing architecture for embodied humanoid robotics. NUClear is modular, has low latency, and promotes functional and expandable software design. It greatly reduces the latency for messages passed between modules as the message routes are established at compile time. It also reduces the number of functions that must be written using a system called co-messages, which aids in dealing with multiple simultaneous data. NUClear has primarily been evaluated on a humanoid robotic soccer platform and on a robotic boat platform. Evaluations show that NUClear requires fewer callbacks and cache variables over existing message-passing architectures. NUClear does have limitations when applying these techniques on <b>multi-processed</b> systems. It performs best in lower power systems where computational resources are limited.

In addition, it is well know that with technology scaling, current electrical technology will face fundamental sig-naling limitation that will make it increasingly difficult to meet the bandwidth and latency requirements of future NoCs. One potential solution for overcoming these limitations of electrical interconnects is the inclusion of optical components. Optical interconnects can provide higher bandwidth, reduce power dissipation, and enable increased wiring simplification.

The constituent particle species {{are assumed to}} satisfy various thermodynamical statistics. The gas of bags is probed to study the phase transition for a nuclear matter in the extreme conditions. These bags are interpreted as the Hagedorn states {{and they are the}} highly excited hadronic states which are produced below the phase transition point to the quark-gluon plasma. The hadronic density of states has the Gross-Witten critical point and exhibits a third order phase transition from a hadronic phase dominated by the discrete low-lying hadronic mass spectrum particles to another hadronic phase dominated by the continuous Hagedorn states. The Hagedorn threshold production is found just above the highest known experimental discrete low-lying hadronic mass spectrum. The subsequent Hagedorn phase undergoes a first order deconfinement phase transition to an explosive quark-gluon plasma. The role of the chiral phase transition in the phases of the discrete low-lying mass spectrum and the continuous Hagedorn mass spectrum is also considered. It is found crucial in the phase transition diagram. Alternate scenarios are briefly discussed for the Hagedorn gas undergoes a higher order phase transition through <b>multi-processes</b> of internal color-flavor structure modification.
