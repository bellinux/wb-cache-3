5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced {{by the fact that}} he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Society {{throughout}} Europe {{was disturbed}} by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined {{from a high of}} 90 to closer to 50 per cent {{by the end of the}} period. Landlords also became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry.|$|E

25|$|During {{the later}} {{half of the}} Joseon dynasty (1392–1897), many {{scholars}} became disenchanted with Sinocentrism and became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> Korea's uniqueness and independence. This trend {{became known as the}} silhak ("pragmatic learning") movement. The most important pre-1895 precursor to the rise of nationalist historiography was the erosion of Sinocentrism during the silhak movement.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{like other}} post-industrial nations, the United States saw {{increased}} health consciousness among persons of higher social status. Persons of higher status {{are less likely}} to smoke, more likely to exercise regularly, and be <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> their diet. Additionally, poorer Americans are more likely to consume lower quality, processed foods. One can therefore conclude that low socio-economic status contributes to a person's likelihood of being obese.|$|E

25|$|Fine Gael's {{proposals}} have sometimes been criticised mostly by smaller political groupings in Ireland, and {{by some of}} the trade unions, who have raised the idea that the party's solutions are <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> business interests than the interests of the worker. The SIPTU trade union has stated its opposition to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny's assertion, in response to Ireland's economic crisis, that the national wage agreement should be suspended. Kenny's comments had support however and the party attributes its significant rise in polls in 2008 to this.|$|E
25|$|The Napoleonic Wars sent Norway into an {{economic}} crisis, as {{nearly all the}} merchants had gone bankrupt during the blockade. Recovery was difficult because of export tariffs and the country experienced high inflation. The Norwegian speciedaler was established as a currency by the Bank of Norway when it was established in 1816, financed through a silver tax which lasted until 1842. Under threat of a coup d'état by Carl Johan, Norway reluctantly paid the debt stated in the Treaty of Kiel, despite never having ratified it. Constitution Day on 17 May became an important political rally every year; in 1829 the Swedish governor-general Baltzar von Platen resigned after he used force against demonstrators in the Battle of the Square. The {{first half of the}} century was dominated by the ca. 2,000 officials, as there were few bourgeois and no aristocracy following an 1821 decision to abolish nobility. From the 1832 election, farmers became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> electing themselves, resulting in a majority of farmers in Parliament. This resulted in rural tax cuts and higher import tariffs, shifting the tax burden to the cities. They also passed the Local Committees Act, which established elected municipal councils from 1838. Cultural expression from the 1840s to the 1870s was dominated by the romantic nationalism, which emphasized the uniqueness of Norway.|$|E

Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition. [...] In 1968 Miss Whitlam wrote: 'Ours is a world where each year we become <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> how quickly and radically our environment is changing. [...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E
500|$|It remains disputed to {{this day}} how the Anglo-German {{cooperation}} on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as {{to the source of}} the initiative. In mid-1901, with the distraction of the Boxer Rebellion gone, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral Otto von Diederichs was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor was unconvinced about the military action. Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with Vineta and Falke sent to the Venezuelan coast. In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier [...] ) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government. [...] Complicating matters were rumours [...] "rampant in the United States and in England" [...] that Germany wanted Margarita Island as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser SMS Vineta had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be. In late 1901, the British Foreign Office became concerned that Britain would look bad if it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible common action, initially receiving a negative response. By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action. The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British [...] "after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in Somalia".|$|E

2500|$|God Speaks takes a {{strictly}} nondualist approach {{in explaining the}} universe and its purpose, carefully clarifying and syncretising terms as it takes the reader through the spiritual journey of the atma (soul) through its imagined evolution, reincarnation, and involution, to its goal, its origin, of Paramatma (Over-soul). The journey winds up being one from God-unconscious ("Beyond Beyond State of God") to God-conscious ("Beyond State of God"). Cohen summarizes, [...] "In elaborate detail he explains the universe is an arena where infinite existence, identifying with the apparently limited soul, becomes more and <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> its oneness with itself as the Over-Soul." ...|$|E

Bernard Lewis, the British historian, refers to the musician {{as an example of a}} Middle Eastern, who has understood to meet the influence of the Western culture on the basis of equal collaboration. Bashir sought and found new possibilities of musical expression by standing up for the traditions of [...] "his" [...] music and by dealing with older forms.|$|E

2500|$|The medical {{terminology}} {{applied to}} experiences during early pregnancy {{has changed over}} time. Before the 1980s, health professionals used the phrase [...] "spontaneous abortion" [...] for a miscarriage and [...] "induced abortion" [...] for a termination of the pregnancy. In the late 1980s and 1990s, doctors became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> their language in relation to early pregnancy loss. Some medical authors advocated change to use of [...] "miscarriage" [...] instead of [...] "spontaneous abortion" [...] because they argued this would more respectful and help ease a distressing experience. The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s. In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Audre Lorde {{started a}} visiting {{professorship}} in West Berlin at the Free University of Berlin. She was invited by FU lecturer Dagmar Schultz who {{met her at}} the UN [...] "World Women's Conference" [...] in Copenhagen in 1980. While Lorde was in Germany she made {{a significant impact on}} the women there and was a big part of the start of the Afro-German movement. The term Afro-German was created by Lorde and some Black German women as a nod to African-American. During her many trips to Germany, Lorde touched many women's lives including May Ayim, Ika Hügel-Marshall, and Hegal Emde. All of these women decided to start writing after they met Audre Lorde. Instead of fighting systemic issues through violence, Lorde thought that language was a powerful form of resistance and encouraged the women of Germany to speak up instead of fight back. Her impact on Germany reached more than just Afro-German women. Many white women and men found Lorde's work to be very beneficial to their own lives, too. They started to put their privilege and power into question and became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> intersectional lives.|$|E
