500|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) are {{a developing}} technology that clinicians hope {{will one day}} bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology {{has the potential to}} help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single <b>monitoring</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

5000|$|NSMS {{technology}} was patented {{as early as}} 1949, [...] with many improvements patented since that date. Some recent US practitioners believe that NSMS was first developed in 1980, by major aircraft engine OEMs (and the US Air Force). [...] It may be envisioned as a replacement technology to rotating strain gauges, however it is currently used as an essential complement to strain gauges. The technology is widely used for turbo-machinery development and high cycle fatigue (HCF) troubleshooting. Due to the direct blade observation, external mounting and inherent serviceability of the sensors, NSMS has been used since at least 2006 as a long term health <b>monitoring</b> <b>method.</b> [...] More recently, multiple practitioners are becoming active in this application of the technology.|$|E

50|$|The extreme {{sensitivity}} of SQUIDs makes them ideal for studies in biology. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), for example, uses measurements from {{an array of}} SQUIDs to make inferences about neural activity inside brains. Because SQUIDs can operate at acquisition rates {{much higher than the}} highest temporal frequency of interest in the signals emitted by the brain (kHz), MEG achieves good temporal resolution. Another area where SQUIDs are used is magnetogastrography, which is concerned with recording the weak magnetic fields of the stomach. A novel application of SQUIDs is the magnetic marker <b>monitoring</b> <b>method,</b> which is used to trace the path of orally applied drugs. In the clinical environment SQUIDs are used in cardiology for magnetic field imaging (MFI), which detects the magnetic field of the heart for diagnosis and risk stratification.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} and application variables {{that affect the}} selection of the optimal level <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> for industrial and commercial processes. The selection criteria include the physical: phase (liquid, solid or slurry), temperature, pressure or vacuum, chemistry, dielectric constant of medium, density (specific gravity) of medium, agitation (action), acoustical or electrical noise, vibration, mechanical shock, tank or bin size and shape. Also important are the application constraints: price, accuracy, appearance, response rate, ease of calibration or programming, physical size and mounting of the instrument, monitoring or control of continuous or discrete (point) levels.In short, level sensors are one of the very important sensors and play very important role in a variety of consumer/ industrial applications. As with other types of sensors, level sensors are available or can be designed using a variety of sensing principles. Selection of an appropriate type of sensor suiting to the application requirement is very important.|$|E
