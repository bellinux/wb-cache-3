5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond <b>material</b> <b>that</b> is used {{to simulate}} {{the appearance of a}} diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Bonham's Auction House sold a large {{archive of}} Welles's <b>material</b> <b>that</b> had {{once belonged to}} the film's {{executive}} producer Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Most of the material was from Chimes at Midnight, and included Welles's original artwork, photographs and memos. This collection was later donated to the University of Michigan for scholarly study.|$|E
5000|$|Explosive {{materials}} may {{be categorized}} by {{the speed at}} which they expand. <b>Materials</b> <b>that</b> detonate (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the speed of sound) are said to be [...] "high explosives" [...] and <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> deflagrate are said to be [...] "low explosives". Explosives may also be categorized by their sensitivity. Sensitive <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are primary explosives and <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> are relatively insensitive are secondary or tertiary explosives.|$|R

5|$|Like Patanjali's Yogasutras, the Yoga Yajnavalkya {{describes}} the eight components of yoga; however, it has different goals. The text contains additional <b>material</b> <b>that</b> is {{not found in}} Yogasutras, such as the concept of kundalini. The Yoga Yajnavalkya contains {{one of the most}} comprehensive discussion of yoga components such as the Pranayama, Pratyahara Dhyana, and Dharana.|$|E
5000|$|In the Bamana language, Kasobané means [...] "prison is finished, we are free" [...] {{which signifies}} the Groupe's {{avoidance}} of <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> are not {{their own and}} the use of <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> are naturally occurring in Mali instead.|$|R
40|$|The two {{principle}} {{objectives are}} to develop <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> superconduct at higher temperatures and {{to better understand}} the mechanisms behind high temperature superconductivity.

50|$|The Drucker {{stability}} postulates {{are often}} invoked in nonlinear finite element analysis. <b>Materials</b> <b>that</b> satisfy these criteria are generally well-suited for numerical analysis, while <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> fail to satisfy this criterion {{are likely to}} present difficulties (i.e. non-uniqueness or singularity) during the solution process.|$|R
5|$|The Romans made durable {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for load-bearing walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic <b>material</b> <b>that</b> {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E
5|$|The drift theory {{holds that}} the organic {{material}} did not form in or near its present location. Rather, it asserts that the <b>material</b> <b>that</b> would become a coal ball was transported from another location {{by means of a}} flood or a storm.|$|E

5|$|A 3-CD {{set of the}} Tertiary Phase was {{released}} in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio. A 2-CD set of the Quandary Phase {{was released}} {{at the end of}} May 2005, and a 2-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include <b>material</b> <b>that</b> was originally cut for reasons of timing.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of <b>material</b> <b>that</b> is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks {{to give effect to}} the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous <b>material</b> <b>that</b> bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich <b>material</b> <b>that</b> makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. Further observations are necessary to confirm the nature of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for <b>material</b> <b>that</b> presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a <b>material</b> <b>that</b> resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
50|$|Nanophase {{ceramics}} are ceramics <b>that</b> are nanophase <b>materials</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>materials</b> <b>that</b> have grain sizes under 100 nanometers).They {{have the}} potential for superplastic deformation. Because of the small grain size and added grain boundaries properties such as ductility, hardness, and reactivity see drastic changes from ceramics with larger grains.|$|R

5|$|Feeling {{restricted}} by his experiences as an R sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's Greenwich Village, {{which had a}} vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and <b>material</b> <b>that</b> he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go, as John Hammond Jr.'s backing group.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding <b>material</b> <b>that</b> will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a <b>material</b> <b>that</b> is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E
