5|$|On July 2007, Konami re-released all the {{mainline}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid {{games on}} the PS and PS2, along with the PSP game <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid: Portable Ops, individually {{and as part of}} a limited edition box set in Japan commemorating the 20th anniversary of the original <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear.</b> This edition of <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 3 features the first disc from the Subsistence version and a new second disc containing only the MSX2 <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> games, lacking <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Online (due to the discontinuation of its servers), as well as all the other content that was present in Subsistences original second disc (Snake vs. Monkey, Duel Mode and Secret Theater). A similar box set was released for the North American market on March 2008, titled <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid: The Essential Collection, which includes the first disc of <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 3: Subsistence along with the original <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid and <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 2: Substance, but lacks the second disc with the MSX2 games from the Japanese 20th Anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|A bonus {{documentary}} DVD video titled <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Saga Vol. 1 was bundled with pre-orders for Subsistence in North America {{and with}} the European Platinum reissue of Snake Eater released in Germany on March 23, 2006. The disc includes a five-part, 30-minute featurette about the entire <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series interspersed with an interview of Hideo Kojima, as well as trailers for various current <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> games.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 3: Snake Eater is an action-adventure stealth {{video game}} {{produced}} by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan for the PlayStation 2. It {{was released in}} late 2004 in North America and Japan, then in early 2005 in Europe and Australia. It was the fifth <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> game {{written and directed by}} Hideo Kojima and serves as a prequel to the previous installments.|$|E
50|$|In a pre-release interview, {{director}} Hideo Kojima {{stated that}} the Gekko are not the game's titular <b>Metal</b> <b>Gears,</b> stating {{that they are more}} like a jeep or a tank compared to the conventional <b>Metal</b> <b>Gears</b> such as REX and RAY.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014, an {{estimated}} 80% of all gearing produced worldwide {{is produced by}} net shape molding.Molded gearing is usually either powder metallurgy or plastic. Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection molded plastic and die cast <b>metal</b> <b>gears),</b> but powdered <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> require sintering and sand castings or investment castings require gear cutting or other machining to finish them. The {{most common form of}} gear cutting is hobbing, but gear shaping, milling, and broaching also exist. 3D printing as a production method is expanding rapidly. For <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used.|$|R
50|$|Gears are {{commonly}} made from metal, plastic, and wood. Although gear cutting {{is a substantial}} industry, many <b>metal</b> and plastic <b>gears</b> are made without cutting, by processes such as die casting or injection molding. Some <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> made with powder metallurgy require subsequent machining, whereas others are complete after sintering. Likewise, <b>metal</b> or plastic <b>gears</b> made with additive manufacturing {{may or may not}} require finishing by cutting, depending on application.|$|R
5|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> is a stealth action {{video game}} series created by Hideo Kojima and {{developed}} {{and published by}} Konami. The series debuted in Japan on July 12, 1987 with <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> {{and is one of}} Konami's best-selling franchises, with over 26.5 million units sold. The games take place in a semi-fictional universe with stories that involve a special forces agent (Solid Snake in most games) who is forced to destroy the latest incarnation of the superweapon <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear,</b> as well as having to rescue various hostages and neutralize certain renegade units in the process. <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> titles have been released on numerous video game consoles, handheld game consoles, and personal computer platforms. Related novels, comics, and other dramatizations have also been released. A few of the series' main characters have also appeared in other Konami games.|$|E
5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E
5|$|A novelization of <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid: Snake Eater, {{written by}} Satoshi Hase, was {{published}} by Kadokawa Shoten in Japan on January 25, 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Paul Moody {{substituted}} leather belting for <b>metal</b> <b>gearing</b> {{to transfer}} {{power from the}} main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S.|$|R
25|$|The {{final step}} towards today's tiple {{takes place in}} the switch from a wooden machine head to a {{mechanical}} one with <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> allowing the player to find the correct tuning not unlike today's guitars.|$|R
5000|$|Omitted {{from this}} {{taxonomy}} is the [...] "zeroth-generation" [...] computer based on <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> (such as the IBM 407) or mechanical relays (such as the Mark I), and the post-third-generation computers based on Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits.|$|R
5|$|A {{remake of}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid, titled <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid: The Twin Snakes, was {{developed}} by Silicon Knights {{under the supervision of}} Hideo Kojima and released for the GameCube in North America, Japan, and Europe in March 2004. While Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights, its cutscenes were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing bullet time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively. While the storyline and settings of the game were unchanged (although a select few lines of dialog were re-written more closely resembling the original Japanese version), a variety of gameplay features from Sons of Liberty were added such as the first person aiming and hanging from bars on walls. Another change in the English voice acting was the reduction of Mei Ling's, Naomi's and Nastasha's accents, as well as the recasting of Gray Fox from Greg Eagles, who still reprises the role of the DARPA chief, to Rob Paulsen. The graphics were also updated to match those of <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid was a {{commercial}} success, shipping over six million copies worldwide. It {{became one of}} the most rented games and topped sales charts in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The PC {{version of}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Asia in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports {{the use of a}} keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The PC version is simply labelled <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid on the packaging, but the actual game uses the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid: Integral logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content. The biggest change was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus eliminating the need for a stand-alone third disc.|$|E

50|$|His goal is {{to create}} robots with exaggerated movements, and to do that he prefers small, tough servos with <b>metal</b> <b>gears,</b> using the best {{hardware}} he can afford. The form, or outer shell, can be made in two ways: traditionally-sculpted molds which are vacuum sealed, or through the use of CAD software and a rapid prototyping machine (3D printer technology).|$|R
50|$|The Newcomen {{steam engine}} was first used, to pump {{water from a}} mine, in 1712. John Smeaton {{introduced}} <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> and axles to water wheels {{in the mid to}} last half of the 18th century. Smeaton also conducted a scientific investigation into the design of water wheels which led to significant efficiency increases. The Industrial Revolution started mainly with textile machinery, such as the spinning jenny (1764) and water frame (1768).|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the emphasis is on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|E
5|$|A novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid was written by Raymond Benson and published by Del Rey. The American paperback edition was published on May 27, 2008, and the British Edition on June 5, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Another World was {{innovative}} {{in its use}} of cinematic {{effects in}} both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced {{a number of other}} video games and designers, inspiring such titles as Flashback, Ico, <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid, and Silent Hill.|$|E

50|$|Nippon Kogaku chose {{an unusually}} high {{standard}} of workmanship for amateur level SLRs. It kept using high strength alloy parts, hardened <b>metal</b> <b>gearing,</b> ball bearing joints and gold plated electrical switches, all made to precise tolerances and largely hand assembled, in the Nikon compact F-series. As a result, the Nikon FE could endure conditions that would cause virtually all other contemporary non-professional level SLRs to break down. A higher price was considered a fair trade for impressive durability.|$|R
50|$|Released in April 2008. This Savage {{includes}} a new K5.9 (.36) motor with aluminum tuned pipe and a stretched chassis. Several {{changes have been}} made to improve on the truck, including stronger diff gears, steel spur gear, uprated driveshafts, thicker chassis, <b>metal</b> <b>geared</b> steering servo, aluminum clutch shoes, 3-speed gearbox as stock, and much more. New wheels and tires and a new body complete the truck, which is RTR and comes with a rechargeable receiver pack and charger.|$|R
5|$|Considered {{one of the}} {{greatest}} video games of all time, <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid 3: Snake Eater received praise for its story, gameplay, graphics, setting, characters, and ending, as well as departing from the series' conventions. Snake Eater was a commercial success, having sold 3.6 million copies worldwide by August 2005.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear),</b> the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E

50|$|Both Nikon's F2 and the Nikkormats were prized {{for their}} {{toughness}} and reliability. Nippon Kogaku wanted to distill these qualities {{into a new}} smaller and lighter design. Nippon Kogaku continued with their unusually high standard of workmanship for amateur level SLRs. For the FM this meant the use of high strength machined metal parts, hardened <b>metal</b> <b>gears,</b> a bearing-mounted film and shutter transport, and a camera assembled to precise tolerances. As a result, the Nikon FM {{is one of the}} most reliable 35mm SLR designs ever built.|$|R
5|$|Snake {{enters the}} {{facility}} via an air vent and locates the first hostage, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson. Anderson reveals that <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> REX can be deactivated {{with a secret}} detonation override code, but dies of a heart attack. Colonel Campbell's niece Meryl Silverburgh, held hostage in an adjoining cell, helps Snake escape. Snake locates another hostage, ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave a PAL card that might prevent the launch, but he too dies of a sudden heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> Online service for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of red team or blue team, respectively). According to <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> and Rumble Roses. However, the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> development team at the time refused to work with them. Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series Dead or Alive, the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E
5|$|Video game {{director}} Hideo Kojima {{has also}} cited 2001: A Space Odyssey as his favorite movie {{of all time}} and is frequently referenced in the <b>Metal</b> <b>Gear</b> series; Otacon is named after Hal and Solid Snake's real name is Dave.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of a material for high volume, low cost gears requires careful consideration of all the requirements and the processes used to manufacture the gears. The wrong choice in material selection could very well {{mean the difference between}} success and failure. A summary of the cost that might be expected for different materials and processes is presented; {{it can be seen that}} the cost can span nearly three order of magnitudes from the molded plastic gear to the machined gear with stamped and powder <b>metal</b> <b>gears</b> falling in between these extremes...|$|R
