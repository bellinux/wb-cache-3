25|$|Some {{pieces are}} limited to moving one square at a time. If a {{friendly}} piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its {{subsequent}} GM E platform stablemates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado, the Riviera was initially a standard front engine/rear-wheel drive platform, only becoming {{front wheel drive}} starting in 1979 {{as part of a}} sweeping <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction by the American automobile industry.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{hired to}} teach design classes (in the College of Agriculture), it was Arneson who {{established}} the ceramic sculpture {{program for the}} Art Department.

25|$|The queen, dragon king, dragon horse, chariots, rook, bishop, side flier, {{movers and}} lance can move {{any number of}} squares along a {{straight}} line, limited by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opponent's piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square, and removing it from the board. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction at all.|$|E
25|$|The 'sliding defence' {{requires}} that gaps are left at either {{edge of the}} field {{at the end of the}} defensive line, which aims to squeeze more players around the area of play. This allows the line to be at its strongest around the position of play, thus leaving the attacking side less opportunity to run through the line. Should the attacking side move the ball towards one {{edge of the field}} in an attempt to go around the defensive line, then the entire defensive line will <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction; this is known as sliding.|$|E
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} empty squares along a {{straight}} line, limited only by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction at all.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been criticized for the {{loophole}} it creates in the perjury statutes as essentially allowing a witness to lie without consequences.

50|$|The merger {{came after}} {{proposals}} {{to form a}} powerful financial holding within the Basque context put forward by like savings banks in the Basque Autonomous Community failed to materialize.

50|$|Typically {{the chain}} {{reaction}} takes less than 1 μs (100 shakes), {{during which time}} the bullet travels only 0.3 mm. Although the chain reaction is slower when the supercriticality is low, it still happens in a time so short that the bullet hardly <b>moves</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time.|$|R
25|$|The kings, drunken elephants, blind tigers, ferocious leopards, {{reclining}} dragons, Chinese cocks, old monkeys, evil wolves, generals, angry boars, cat swords, coiled serpents, dark spirits, Devas, go betweens and pawns only move one square at a time. If an opponent's piece {{occupies a}} square {{that is a}} possible destination for the moving piece, the opponent's piece may be captured by placing the moving piece on that square, and removing the opponent's piece from the board. If a friendly piece (that is, a piece controlled by the same player) occupies the square, the moving piece may not <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.|$|E
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} empty squares along a {{straight}} orthogonal or diagonal line, limited only by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction at all.|$|E
25|$|Like most plesiosaurs, and {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to many common media depictions, Elasmosaurus was incapable of raising anything more than its head above the water. The weight of its long neck placed the center of gravity behind the front flippers. Thus Elasmosaurus could only have raised its head and neck above the water if in shallow water, where it could rest its body on the bottom. The weight of the neck, the limited musculature, and the limited movement between the vertebrae would have prevented Elasmosaurus from raising its head and neck very high as well. The head and shoulders of the Elasmosaurus most likely acted as a rudder. If the animal moved the anterior part of the body in a certain direction, it would cause {{the rest of the body}} to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. Thus, Elasmosaurus could not have swum in one direction while moving its head and neck either horizontally or vertically in a different direction.|$|E
60|$|In October {{came the}} startling news that Berlin itself was threatened, {{and that a}} force, said to be fifteen {{thousand}} strong, under General Haddick, was in rapid motion towards it. Prince Maurice was ordered to hasten to its defence, and the king also <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.|$|R
2500|$|One of the 14th-century Oxford Calculators, William Heytesbury, lacking {{differential}} calculus {{and the concept}} of limits, proposed to measure instantaneous speed [...] "by the path that would be described by [...] if... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> given instant".|$|R
50|$|Moll {{then left}} the band after {{disagreements}} with the other members, {{and was replaced by}} Daniel Louis. With the popularity of disco in the mid-1970s, Barrabás <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction and produced a number of minor hits. They disbanded in 1978, and Arbex moved fully towards writing and producing music for other artists.|$|R
500|$|Burton became {{attached}} as director, while producer Denise Di Novi {{and writer}} Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of {{his plans to}} direct Catwoman or an adaptation of [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, [...] "Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened {{may not have been}} my best logistical <b>move,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." [...] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry.|$|E
500|$|Three {{proposals}} for minority representation in Parliament {{had been considered}} by a 1966 Constitutional Commission chaired by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. The first {{was to have a}} committee of representatives of minorities that would elect three persons from amongst its members to represent minorities in Parliament. However, this was rejected as the Commission felt that it would be an inappropriate and retrogressive <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> unelected members {{should not be allowed to}} dilute the elected chamber. The second proposal, which was to have proportional representation, was also rejected on the grounds that it would intensify party politics along racial lines and eventually [...] "perpetuate and accentuate racial differences". This would then make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a single homogeneous community out of the many races that form the population of the Republic. The third proposal was to have an upper house in Parliament composed of members elected or nominated to represent the racial, linguistic and religious minorities in Singapore. However, this was rejected as being backward-looking since politicians should attain a seat in Parliament through taking part in elections.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure {{said there was a}} great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction to demonstrate Pam was trying to figure out what she wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{control system}} uses two buttons for movement, keeping the player on a 2-D axis, despite the 3D arena. Pressing the left button <b>moves</b> the {{character}} <b>in</b> the left direction, pressing the right <b>moves</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> respective direction. Double tapping each button produces a dash in each corresponding direction for evasion and closing distance. Pressing both buttons makes the character block.|$|R

500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

5|$|Though more seats {{had been}} added to the synagogue by {{narrowing}} the aisles, as a result of Sparger's innovations Beth Elohim outgrew its Pearl Street building, and a new one was sought. After a three-year search, in 1885 Beth Elohim purchased the building of the Congregational Church at 305 State Street (near Hoyt) for $28,000 (today $), and <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|R
