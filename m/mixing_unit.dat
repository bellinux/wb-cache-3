We pose a conjecture concerning characterizations of such <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs, verify parts of it in general, and prove it completely for diamond-free graphs. In particular, we characterize diamond-free <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs {{by means of an}} infinite family of forbidden induced subgraphs, and we show that a diamond-free graph is <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval if and only if it has intersection representations using unit intervals such that all ends of the intervals are integral...|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{helicopter}} {{has three}} flight control inputs—the cyclic stick, the collective lever, and the anti-torque pedals. [...] Depending on {{the complexity of}} the helicopter, the cyclic and collective may be linked together by a <b>mixing</b> <b>unit,</b> a mechanical or hydraulic device that combines the inputs from both and then sends along the [...] "mixed" [...] input to the control surfaces to achieve the desired result. The manual throttle may also be considered a flight control because it is needed to maintain rotor speed on smaller helicopters without governors. The governors also help the pilot control the collective pitch on the helicopter's main rotors, to keep a stable, more accurate flight.|$|E

The primary cause of the accident was found to be a failure in the flight control systems, specifically a separation of the fore/aft bellcrank from the pitch control linkages in the aircraft's <b>mixing</b> <b>unit.</b> The failure in the flight control systems was ultimately found to be caused by systematic errors and deficiencies in the maintenance program employed by 817 Squadron {{at the time of the}} accident.

40|$|Abstract. A new SVLX {{static mixer}} is {{original}} {{designed by the}} author with the structure of alternative connection of the SV static <b>mixing</b> <b>unit</b> and cross shaped stationary helical fin. The two-phase flow is sheared, separated, impinged and rotated by SV static <b>mixing</b> <b>unit,</b> as well as whirled by the cross shaped stationary helical fin. Hence the mixer efficiency is enhanced. The most advantage of this design is the mixer efficiency is more enhanced with none applied force. Followed by the static mixer structure illustration, the preliminary analysis of the two-phase flow field is carried out, which provides some proofs for the selection and optimization of the new SVLX static mixer structural parameters...|$|E

40|$|A new and novel {{continuous}} mixer for rub-ber compounds {{has been developed}} in a co-operation between the Rubber Process Engineering Centre at Loughborough Uni-versity and Carter Bros (Rochdale) Ltd. The mixing conditions can be adjusted {{over a wide range}} from the control panel to suit the rubber compound, with the aim of combining the versatility of the internal mixer with the inherent energy efficiency and consistency of a continuous system. The new mixer comprises two main ele-ments, a compactor/feeder and a single-rotor <b>mixing</b> <b>unit.</b> In the compactor/feeder a particulate pre-blend is converted to a continuum (the incorporation stage) and is then metered the <b>mixing</b> <b>unit,</b> where it is subjected first to distributive mixing and subsequently to dispersive mixing. Separa-tion of the distributive and dispersive mix-ing functions allows the latter to be opti-mised to apply local, high intensity stresses to the rubber compound. A prototype with a maximum output of 150 kg/h has been built. Results to date confirm that a low rubber temperature in combination with good filler dispersion and energy efficiency is attain-able.
