25|$|At {{the age of}} 26, {{around the}} time {{he was elected to the}} Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the Ferme générale, a tax farming {{financial}} company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme générale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a wall around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city.

25|$|Riker and Ordeshook {{developed}} the modern understanding of D. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: {{complying with the}} social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision. Other political scientists have since added other <b>motivators</b> and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions. All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, {{making it difficult to}} discover exactly why people choose to vote.|$|E
25|$|Motivation is {{the driving}} force of desire behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary <b>motivators.</b> Within economics, motivation is often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|E
