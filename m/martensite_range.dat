40|$|Abstract:- It {{has been}} shown that the deep cold {{treatment}} of steel parts, especially made of tool steels, results in additional strengthening (superstrengthening) of material and essentially reduces the tool deterioration. The essential effect is reached if the deep cold treatment and austenite-to-martensite transformation coincide. This is explained by the creation of extremely high density of dislocations in the material, while these dislocations are frozen and do not accumulate at the boundaries of grains in the form of potential microcracks. The uniform distribution and dislocation freezing result in the release of nano-carbides. Long holding at the low temperature results in fastening (capturing) dislocations with atoms of carbon and other alloy elements. The high density of dislocations and their uniform distribution is the cause of high strength and plasticity of material and their wear resistance. To get stable results of cryogen treatment of steel parts, thermal and physical bases for the control of phase transformations have been developed, which include two-step cooling. At the first step the part is cooled to the martensite start temperature. At the second step, depending on the material, the part is intensively cooled within the <b>martensite</b> <b>range</b> or deeply cold-treated. This approach allows to obtain stable and reliable results...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{the plastic}} flow {{properties}} of transforming metastable austenite, stable austenite, and <b>martensite</b> over a <b>range</b> of temperatures and strain rates allows quantitative estimates of (a) the static-hardening effect of the two-phase mixture and (b) the dynamic-softening effect of the transformation as a deformation mechanism. A constitutive relation is derived predicting the flow behavior of metastable austenite from the strain-induced transformation kinetics and the flow properties of the two separate phases...|$|R
40|$|The impact {{strength}} of hardened Type 410 stainless steel {{is known to}} be adversely af-fected when the steel is tempered between 750 and 1050 F. However, a desirable com-bination of other properties may be obtained by tempering within this range. An investigation was performed {{to determine the extent of}} improvement in {{impact strength}} that may result from certain variations in heat-treating procedures. The hard-ening operation was studied thoroughly, and a large number of commercial heats was in-cluded in the program to establish the consistency of results. It was found that the cooling rate through the <b>martensite</b> transformation <b>range</b> has a significant effect upon the impact properties after subsequent tempering. Rapid cool-ing such as that which occurs during oil quenching is detrimental, but air cooling of 0. 4 -in-diameter bar samples was sufficiently slow to bring about a marked improvement. This improvement was present for samples tempered at all temperatures through 1000 F with the greatest degree of improvement occurring for samples tempered in the range of 700 to 900 F. No improvement was observed for samples tempered at 1100 F and above. Martempering procedures are particularly suited for taking advantage of this phe-nomenon...|$|R
40|$|For {{low-carbon}} V-Nb micro-alloyed steel, {{dual phase}} ferrite-martensitic microstructures were prepared with a variable <b>martensite</b> fraction, which <b>ranged</b> from Vm 20 to 88 %. By measuring {{the temperature in}} the sample centre, the parameters of intercritical annealing and the relationship between Vm and the intercritical annealing temperature 720 °C <= t <= 850 °C were determined. By analysing the microstructure, the strength and plastic properties of this dual phase steel, the preparation method of dual phase ferrite-martensitic steels was tested. Dual phase ferrite-martensitic microstructures at Vm above 53 % formed continuous martensite areas. A change of the microstructure type as compared with the state with Vm < 53 % resulted in a change of the increase of RpO 2 and Rm. With growing Vm the strength properties increased and the plastic properties decreased. Fractures after uniaxial loading had a ductile pit morphology. On extraction carbon replicas, changes of precipitation of fine disperse precipitates were studied on the normalized state and the intercritically annealed state...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} problem of how to reduce the prime cost of Grade Q 125 Group 4 casing and tubing {{according}} to API 5 CT and proposes process solutions to resolve it, consisting in the enhancement of series of mechanical properties without chemical alloying of steel with expensive elements such as chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and boron. During the investigation the process parameters of 9 MnSi 5 low-alloy steel heat treatment were developed, which confirmed the efficiency of this technology providing high values of strength and yield strengths which are minimum 931 MPa and 862 MPa respectively; at the same time maintaining the required cold resistance and resistance to hydrogen cracking of pipe. The suggested process parameters were based on heat cycle quenching with heating in induction furnace up to 1050 – 1100 °С, 880 – 900 °С and 740 – 780 °С accordingly at each cycle and cooling rate in each case equal to 50 °С/sec, during which the uniform <b>martensite</b> grain size <b>ranging</b> from 5 to 10 micron was obtained...|$|R
40|$|International audienceModel dual-phase microstructures were {{developed}} to decouple the effect of martensite volume fraction and martensite hardness on the plastic behavior of dual-phase steels. The <b>martensite</b> volume fraction <b>ranges</b> from 11 % to 37 %, involving two levels of martensite hardness. The yield strength and tensile strength increase with increasing martensite volume fraction, while the uniform elongation decreases. The martensite hardness has a weak impact on the initial yield strength, but it significantly affects the flow behavior for sufficiently large martensite volume fraction. Increasing the hardness of the martensite leads to higher tensile strength combined with only a limited impact on uniform elongation, resulting in an improved strength/ductility balance. The experimental results are successfully captured using finite element based micromechanical analysis. Among others, periodic cell calculations show very good predictive capabilities of the overall plastic response when the stage-IV hardening of the ferrite is taken into account. Our numerical analysis reveals that an accurate description of the elasto-plastic behavior of the martensite {{is a key element}} to rationalize the mechanical behavior of DP steels. This modeling approach provides a framework for designing dual-phase steels with optimized plastic flow properties...|$|R
