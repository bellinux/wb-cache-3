40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study {{about the use}} of visualizations in corporate presentations. We interviewed nine executive managers of a leading technology company about how they create business presentations for different meetings and different audiences. Thereby, we focused on which visualization types they normally use and whether they would accept new forms of visualizations such as information graphics, which are currently very popular. Due to the explorative character of the study, we used the grounded theory approach. Results show that design principles or effective visualizations are not known to the most interviewees. The interviewees rated corporate design, use of <b>master</b> <b>layout,</b> and templates higher than individually designed slides. The most popular visualization types managers use in presentations are bar and pie charts. The term "information graphic" was not known. Our conclusion leads to the following hypothesis: If a company wants to change or improve its communication, it will have to become aware of the power of visual storytelling and start an "iconic turn"...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This {{paper was}} {{motivated}} {{by the absence of}} a government examination of and professional interest in planning conditions as a means of development control in Hong Kong. Proposes to examine this situation. Design/methodology/approach - The research objective is achieved by a field survey and legal analysis of its findings. The field survey of all the 60 residential development projects in Hong Kong under comprehensive development area zoning subject to conditional planning permissions from 1998 to 2000 involving 119 planning applications was conducted to assess factual compliance with planning conditions. Findings - The findings show that, while most physical planning obligations have been duly fulfilled in these projects, the non-depositing of <b>master</b> <b>layout</b> plans for development poses actual and potential public domain problems of planning enforcement, building permission, conveyancing and property management. The major problems of non-compliance are property purchasers being unable to fully appreciate the environment of a development when making a decision to buy; subsequent titles defects, unauthorised building works and operations. Suggestions are made to close the loopholes in planning law and to introduce a formal channel for retrospective rectification {{in the light of the}} social consequences of non-compliance. Originality/value - This paper is the first serious attempt to evaluate the importance of compliance with planning conditions in Hong Kong and its analysis should be of interest not only to local policy makers and professional people in particular, but also to researchers in comparative development control in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a Future Factory concept for Metso Mining and Construction (Tampere) Inc. and calculate its operational and financial benefits in comparison to current operations. Future Factory concept involves both the design of the factory layout and the operational systems, which includes the amount of workforce required. The role of manufacturing operations has become more and more demanding during the past decades. Today, production environment must be flexible, highly productive and still maintain its low assembly cost and high product quality. Metso Mining and Construction Corporation’s Tampere factory plant has developed to the state it is now during its 100 years of history. This master’s thesis has been made to introduce a totally new concept of manufacturing and support factory’s long-term development plan. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part, theoretical background, which consists of three themes, is designed to support the second, empirical part. Firstly, the theoretical background introduces the basic manufacturing philosophies related to Toyota Production System (TPS) and Lean, which were designed to illustrate the best practices for manufacturing operation. Secondly, the design procedure of a new factory layout was researched in order to define a systematic approach to a new layout creation. Finally, the theoretical framework suggests ways to evaluate the newly created layout’s performance compared to the current operations. In addition, benchmarking to corporations having similar assembly operations were made in order to find new ideas outside the company. The empirical part of this thesis uses the created framework to reach the defined objectives. As a result, the thesis introduces a new <b>master</b> <b>layout</b> for Tampere CSE manufacturing, which covers all the designed operations. The calculations indicate a significant improvement not only in the operational performance related to production lead time, but also in the factory’s cost structure. Furthermore, the designed Future Factory concept reveals a strong potential in current operations and the human productivity involved. As a conclusion, the Future Factory master plan suggests key drivers to support the operational change, which are partially feasible in current facilities...|$|E

The study discovered that despite several policies and programmes of the successive governments in Nigeria on urban development such as the promulgation of planning laws like the Town and Country Planning ordinance of 1946, Land Use Act to control issuance of permits for housing construction, The Urban and Regional Planning Act to streamline the responsibilities of each level of government on physical planning and preparation of Physical Development plans such as <b>Master</b> plans, <b>Layout</b> plans and Land Use plans, Urban Renewal plans, Zoning of land use, and other Development control principles, which can be classified as policy issues, urban degeneration has continued to increase. The study attributes this to massive population increase in the urban areas, For example the residents of urban centers in Nigeria in 1950 were less that 15 % of the population and by 1975, and this proportion rose to 23. 4 % and in year 2000 was 43. 3 %. Nigerian urban population growth rate of 4. 8 % annually was markedly higher than growth rate of 1. 2 % in Developed countries. This has created several problems some of which are expansion of squatter settlements, increased poverty and a widening gap between the rich and poor, growing insecurity and rising crime rates, inadequate and deteriorating buildin...|$|R
2500|$|Nintendo World Report's Daniel Bloodworth {{thought the}} Grand Prix mode, {{which should be}} the focus of the game, is [...] "woefully lacking". Bloodworth criticized track length of the first 3 cups; he clocked-in at [...] per lap and {{finished}} three cups within 20 minutes on standard difficulty. He concluded [...] "combined with the low difficulty and re-used environments and music, it all ends up feeling rather unsatisfying." [...] While the fourth cup is more difficult, Bloodworth was taken back by its sudden spike in difficulty—even when playing every cup on Expert or Master. Also, many of its courses were rehashes from the first F-Zero game and GP Legend. During Siliconera's playtest, they praised Climaxs track design and varying levels of difficulty between courses—easier courses are relatively straight compared to later ones which require honed drifting skill. They mentioned the game demanded players to have quick reflexes and <b>master</b> the track <b>layout</b> on difficulties beyond novice since the AI-controlled opponents are unforgivable. Siliconera noted players have to be proficient at both types of speed boosting. Bloodworth explained a properly timed double speed boost can substantially alter the momentum of a race. Compared to GP Legends controls, Siliconera thought the spin attack [...] "is a neat trick to use, that adds a new element to the game." [...] Bloodworth liked the personalized button configurations, especially since vehicles feel stiffer and the game does not allow players to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed.|$|R
40|$|Spot defects {{represent}} the main challenge for enhancement of semiconductor manufacturing yield. As a result, the yield of modern integrated circuits {{is associated with}} the layout sensitivity to defects. The term “layout sensitivity” is defined as the ratio of “critical area”, i. e. part of the layout in which a defect must be placed to cause a functional failure of the device, to the overall layout area. Semiconductor yield models are traditionally based on the analysis of the “critical area”. Such models give accurate results; however, critical area analysis requires massive computations that render these models effort and time consuming. The stochastic method of yield modeling presents a much faster and easier approach. This thesis contributes to the stochastic method of yield modeling by offer-ing an efficient model that predicts the layout sensitivity to defects using very basic lay-out information. The model has some imperative applications that can expedite the yield analysis and prediction for modern VLSI designs. The prime application is pre-layout yield prediction. Using the proposed model, yield prediction can be performed even before starting the costly phase of layout design. Another application is yield forecasting and prediction of defect density requirements for future manufacturing technologies not yet developed. Fi-nally, the simplicity of the model allows its use during automatic cells placement to enhance the yield. A “yield-aware automatic cells placement tool” is implemented. This thesis tackles also the subject of semiconductors reliability. We derive a model that predicts the layout sensitivity to interconnect “narrow defects”, i. e., missing material defect causing the formation of a narrow site in the victim interconnect without resulting in a disconnection in a signal path. Narrow defects favor electromigration, a major inter-connect failure mechanism, that makes narrow interconnects very likely to cause functional failure during operation in the field. The model is used to estimate the average number of narrowing defects in the <b>layout.</b> <b>Master</b> of Science in Computer EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Dimple plate heat {{exchangers}} are {{a new type of}} welded compact plate {{heat exchangers}}. The dimple plates increase the turbulence of the fluid flowing over the plate, increasing the efficiency of the heat exchanger without increasing pressure drop over the heat exchanger. The compact design of the heat exchanger makes it possible to install the heat exchanger at the top of condenser columns, reducing the footprint area of the column by replacing standard shell and tube condensers {{at the foot of the}} column. After the implementation of these condensers in 2008, Sasol experienced failures of 12 column-top dimple plate condensers in unit 300. In these cases damage was observed at the weld between the plates and the bottom header. One possible reason for the damage was vibration caused by the flow over the dimple plates. The characteristics of flow-induced vibrations in dimple {{plate heat exchangers}} were studied in the scientific literature. It was, however, found that although the effect of dimples on channel walls had been wellresearched, the fluid-elastic vibration of the bluff body containing the dimples had not been sufficiently studied. A simple aerodynamic model was constructed to determine the characteristics of the combination of vibration caused by the bluff body (plate) and the flow over the dimples on the plate. The experiment showed the generation of two flow-induced vibration amplitudes. The structure of the heat exchanger was modelled by using mass, stiffness and damping elements. With certain assumptions the model was reduced to a two degrees of freedom system that simulated the most prominent vibration direction. This model was used to simulate the effect of design changes to the response of the structure to a range of forcing frequencies. An experimental model of the column-top condensers was constructed and the response due to different vibration frequencies was measured. The measured results were compared with the theoretically predicted values for cases with the current design and the cases where the vibration-control concept was implemented. This validated the theoretical model and the mathematical simulation as a tool to design vibrationcontrol systems for real heat exchangers. With the replacement of the very stiff mounts that are used in current designs with soft rubber mounts, the dynamic forces on the internal plates was reduced by up to 97. 8 % for certain forcing frequencies. The deflection of the internal plates is a main cause of stress in the plates and, more importantly, the weld fillets connecting the bottom of the plates to a common header. This repeated stress can easily cause fatigue failure in the welds. By therefore reducing the amplitude of vibration of the heat exchangers, the onset of fatigue failure will be substantially delayed, increasing the reliable lifetime of the column-top condenser. This concept is not only limited to dimple plate heat exchangers. The oscillating stress in any internal component can, therefore, be reduced by isolating the whole system with soft rubber mounts of a determined stiffness and <b>layout.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wind has}} become one of the fastest growing {{renewable}} energy sources over the last twenty years. It has the advantage of having great energy generating capabilities, which may be of good value for the energy companies. Due to the constantly increasing power demand, the trend today is towards larger components, more complex control systems and locations further away from shore. As the wind farms are supplying more customers, the need for reliable electrical systems becomes critical. Studies conducted in the area of offshore wind and reliability may therefore be very interesting. In this <b>master</b> thesis, five <b>layouts</b> with reserve connections have been compared with an existing offshore wind farm, Sheringham Shoal, located on the east coast of England. The wind farm is installed with 88 turbines and has a total capacity of 316. 8 MW. It has two export cables connected to different offshore substation platforms, each at 132 kV, and several inter array cables at 33 kV. No reserve connections between the radials are installed, and the benefits of investing in such connections are therefore investigated. A reliability analysis is conducted to find the expected power delivery for each layout. The Relrad methodology is introduced and discussed, and used to find the energy not delivered to shore and the annual system availability index for the layouts. In reliability analyses done for regular distribution systems, the energy not supplied (ENS) to the load points is found. This index would have to be modified, due to the consideration of the load points in this master thesis, looking at each turbine as a negative load point consuming negative power. To fit the wind system analyzed, the previous index is modified and set to energy not delivered (END) from the load points. In addition to the reliability analysis, a power flow analysis is carried out to investigate if the power flows occurring during failures are manageable. If the power is exceeding the cable capacity, actions have to be taken if the reserve connections are to be installed. To find the most profitable reserve connection investments, an economic analysis is also conducted. The potential income from the saved energy is compared with the additional investment cost, and a profit for each layout is calculated. The result shows that for the three first layouts analyzed (Layout 1 - 3), the expected energy delivered to shore has increased compared with the radial system, and the profits are positive. The two remaining layouts (Layout 4 and 5) have a significant increase in the expected energy delivered to shore compared with all previous layouts, and are much more reliable. Layout 4 however, is discarded as a result of the power flow analysis and Layout 5 has, as for now, a negative profit. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results are very much depending on the failure rates and repair times given to the reliability analysis, in addition to the energy price used in the economic analysis. Layout 2, with four reserve connections installed, is found to be the best layout of the ones analyzed in this master thesis. In this layout, the reliability has increased and the profits are high, and is proven to be a good alternative for the existing Sheringham Shoal. In addition to investing in reserve connections, a control system should be installed to prevent the power flow from exceeding the cable capacity. The reliability analysis do also show that in future systems, a connection between the two offshore platforms should be considered because of the significant reduction of energy not delivered to shore. If the energy price increases both Layout 1 and 5 becomes more profitable, and are therefore good alternatives to the one suggested in the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm...|$|R
