40|$|Problem statement: <b>Metering</b> and <b>charging</b> {{are basic}} {{accounting}} functions {{that are essential}} for commercial usage of web services. Current charging and accounting schemes primarily involve users being charged flat or based on the connection/session time. Accounting management of web services should provide for <b>metering,</b> <b>charging,</b> accounting, billing, payment and auditing. We have extended our earlier work, a Policy based Accounting for Web Services (WS-PACT), to develop a generic and comprehensive charging policy that can cater to different charging patterns. WS-PACT provides a flexible model to meet the varying billing and payment needs of service providers. Approach: Policies are expressed in WS-Policy and policy query facility has been developed using XQuery. Results: Users can use the query facility to obtain the charges being levied and can decide on which services to use by taking into account their preferred spending limits and payment patterns. Conclusion: We have implemented and tested the charging policy and query facility with a sample application...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look more closely at {{incentives}} for a landlord to use individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> of heat and water. This paper also aims to look at the possible reasons for the differences in use of individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> between Sweden and Germany. Design/methodology/approach – The research in this paper is based on a questionnaire and interviews with landlords, in Sweden, using individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging.</b> Findings – The two main incentives for the landlords in the survey to use individual metering are the possibility to save energy and the possibility to create a fair allocation of heating cost between tenants. Sweden has a long history of heat and water included in the rent leading to a possibly tougher transition to individual metering. Originality/value – To see the overall picture and understand the purpose of individual metering is important to avoid conflicts between landlords and tenants. The paper aids this process.

50|$|The {{primary action}} {{takes place on}} the top screen with all meters, map, {{character}} messages and choices at the bottom. Players control the Cosmos X2 to stop the alien invasion and travel to its source. The Cosmos X2 has a special Alignment system that allows it to change between two chosen alignments at will. The player has several meters to watch. One <b>meter</b> is the <b>Charge</b> <b>meter</b> which automatically <b>charges</b> the X2’s Shield ability; if the player is hit while this <b>meter</b> is <b>charging</b> or is fully <b>charged,</b> then the <b>meter</b> will reset. Another meter is the Level-Up meter which increases when the player reaches {{a certain number of}} points. The level-ups are randomized and range from weapon upgrades to missile upgrades. The ship has an energy meter that, when depleted when one alignment is equipped, will allow the player to use the other alignment until they complete the stage. If both of the player’s alignment energy meters are drained, then the ship is destroyed and the game is over.|$|R

40|$|Using unique {{survey data}} of 10, 000 {{households}} from 10 OECD countries, we identify the driving factors of household adoption of water-efficient equipment by estimating Probit models of a household's probability {{to invest in}} such equipment. The {{results indicate that the}} adoption of water-efficient equipment is the most strongly affected by ownership status, by being <b>metered</b> and <b>charged</b> a volumetric charge on water consumption, and by behavioural factors. Environmental attitudes are strong predictors of adoption of water-efficient equipment, with a marginal effect that exceeds ownership status in some cases. In terms of policy, we find that households that were both <b>metered</b> and <b>charged</b> for their water individually had a much higher probability to invest in water-efficient equipment compared to households that were not charged for their water...|$|R

All characters feature at least two Ultra Combos. However, only one Ultra can be selected {{at a time in}} a way similar to the Super Arts system in the Street Fighter III series. To Use a Super Combo or an Ultra Combo, the respective meters have to be full. The Ultra combo <b>meter</b> <b>charges</b> up when the player gets hit and so it can also be called a Revenge Meter. The Ultra Combo meter is the one right next to the Super Combo meter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—If environments {{offering}} {{facilities for}} service com-position {{are to be}} commercially successful {{then it will be}} im-portant that service providers can avail of efficient, automated processes by which composed services can be <b>metered,</b> <b>charged</b> and billed for. In many industries, for example telecommunica-tions, sophisticated systems are employed to provide usage and content based charging for services. In these systems charging schemes are typically manually configured and verified prior to services being made available to customers. For composed services we require a more dynamic charging approach, in which charging schemes for composed services can be auto-matically generated and deployed. In this paper we describe a framework that meets this need. In it, charging schemes for services making up a composed services are collected, consolidated and deployed onto multiple rating engines, which then coordinate to calculate a charge for an composed service invocation.

40|$|The study aims {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} in apartment buildings where individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> of heat is applied. The {{aim is to}} develop planning and design for individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> in apartment buildings. The study is based on literature review, interviews and case study that include analysis of existing documents. Interviews were carried out with the property developer and the involved consultants who planned the apartment building Yasuragi. To investigate the differences the condominium association has noted in heat consumption between flats, the debit values of the heat were used to discern which houses that were furthest from the average consumption. On these flats there were temperature measurements and thermal photo shoots made for discriminating behavior and possible construction techniques which could be the explanation for the heat spread. Boverket shows that the consumption of heat can be reduced by 10 - 20 % after insertion of individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> in an apartment block. Heat spread {{is a problem with}} individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> of heat. The spread of heat consumption in Yasuragi depends on heat hikes, transmission losses, external heat sources, thermal bridges and the user’s behavior. The consultant does not plan and design in the current situation to ensure that all flats will be fully equal with respect to external heat sources. They work to make the best possible plan solutions and to make room for all the systems and to get the systems to work. Since the property developer has no requirements or take initiative on IMD-system to the apartments to be equivalent, there are development opportunities in the current situation. The thesis has reported deficiencies in the design stage and provides improvement suggestions to the actors projecting apartment buildings where the IMD applies. It can also be regarded as a knowledge base for developers. To develop the planning stage, the developer and consultants should have experience and better knowledge of how the system is affected by various factors, as well as the design gets to impact upon the final heat consumption. The property developer may require the consultants that they should describe and take into account that each apartment will function equally. Further studies are recommended to investigate whether it is better to build apartment buildings in wooden frames where the individual <b>metering</b> and <b>charging</b> will be applied to reduce the appearance of heat hikes between apartments. The condominium association could through a survey chart the behavior of the residents of the housing...|$|R
