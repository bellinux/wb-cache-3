40|$|ArticleThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Economic efficiency has recently become one of the primary objectives of water management decisions. In particular, as vulnerability of freshwater systems has become evident and there is a trend for water supply managers to look towards water demand management, identifying the cost of such measures is increasingly becoming important. In England and Wales, Part G of the Building Regulations requires that water consumption of a new dwelling should not be more than 125 litres/capita. day. However, while compliance with this is determined by the water use characteristics of the installed <b>micro-components</b> (WCs, showers, basin taps, kitchen taps, baths, dishwashers and washing machines), the cost to consumers resulting from installing water efficient <b>micro-components</b> is not clear. This paper evaluates the potential economic implications of water saving <b>micro-components,</b> assessed from the consumers’ perspective. A methodology has been developed and implemented to assess the cost effectiveness of several types of water efficient <b>micro-components.</b> A range of cost assessment methods were applied, and critically reviewed comparing their outcomes. It was found that conventional cost assessment methods are unsuitable for identifying the least cost options to consumers. Of the applied methods, the modified annualised 34 assessment method appears to be relatively a better option. The work was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and its support is thankfully acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This review covers {{three aspects}} of PCR-based {{microfluidic}} chip assays: sample preparation, target amplifi-cation, and product detection.

In order to accomplish these essential assays without human intervention between individual steps, the <b>micro-components</b> for fluid manipulation become critical. We there-fore summarize and discuss components such as microvalves (for fluid regulation), pumps (for fluid driving) andmixers (for blending fluids).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an innovative {{mechanism for the}} singularization of micro-spheres, which can be effectively employed in a diverse range of robotized applications in micro-electronics and micro-mechanics. Many miniaturized devices are currently being developed and consist of different <b>micro-components</b> to be precisely assembled. The demanding product and process requirements can be met by automating the assembly phases, which include sorting and feeding the <b>micro-components.</b> Therefore, accurate, high-throughput, and modular mechanisms and tools able to supply a number of <b>micro-components,</b> or even a single element for the subsequent operations, play a significant role. In this context, this work focused {{on the development of}} a novel strategy for separating a single component from an unstructured stock of identical parts, in particular of micro-spheres with diameters of 0. 2 – 1 mm. Suitable expedients were considered to overcome the adhesive effects that can become significant at the micro-scale due to the very small size and low mass of the micro-spheres. The paper describes the operating principle and the actuation strategies of the mechanism. The design {{and the development of a}} prototype for singularizing micro-spheres with a diameter of 0. 6 mm are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the results of experimental singularization tests demonstrate the method effectiveness and the mechanism performance...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Anthropogenic climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of modern times posing significant risks to natural resources and the environment. Socio-economic change, severe droughts, and environmental concerns focus attention upon sustainability of water supplies {{and the ability of}} water utilities to meet competing demands worldwide. The 2012 Climate Change Risk Assessment identified water security {{as one of the most}} significant climate threats facing the UK. It is now recognised that household water demand management could offer a low regret adaptation measure (both financially and environmentally) given large uncertainties about future climate and non-climatic pressures. This thesis uses Anglian Water Services (AWS) Golden 100 dataset to explore the climate sensitivity of historic <b>micro-component</b> water-use. This work contributes to a larger integrated assessment of the South-East England water system under the EPSRC Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate Coordination Network (ARCC CN). The Golden 100 is a metered record of 100 households daily water consumption by basin, bath, dishwasher, external, kitchen sink, shower, WC and washing machine use. The archive also includes socio-economic information for each household, dates of the year and daily time series of observed minimum temperature, maximum temperature, sunshine hours, soil moisture deficit, concurrent, and antecedent rainfall amounts. The methodology developed within this research provides a portable approach to error trapping, formatting and mining large, complex water sector datasets, for exploring the relative sensitivities of <b>micro-component</b> metered water-use to weather/non-weather variables. This research recognises both the importance of the choice to use a <b>micro-component</b> and the volume used. As such, logistic and linear generalised regression techniques are employed to explore the relative sensitivity of these two aspects of water-use to climatic and non-climatic variables. The 2009 UK Climate Projections (UKCP 09) projections and climate analogues are then used to bound a climate sensitivity analysis of the most weather-sensitive micro-components using temperature and rainfall scenarios for the 2050 s and 2080 s. This research provides empirical evidence that the most weather sensitive micro-components are external and shower water-use. A key contribution of this research to existing knowledge is the non-linear response of likelihood and volume of external water-use to average air temperatures. There is an abrupt increase in the likelihood of external water-use on days above 15 ºC. Climate sensitivity analysis further suggests that by the 2080 s, under a hotter/drier climate, average unmetered households could be 8...|$|E
