40|$|European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a {{keystone}} species for biodiversity in boreal forests. However, large aspen {{have largely been}} removed from <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (≥ 20 cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11400 ha, 36000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots. The average volumes of mature living and dead aspen were 4. 0 and 1. 3 m 3 /ha in continuous old-growth forests and 0. 2 and 0. 6 m 3 /ha in <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> respectively. These results indicate that large aspen trees in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> are {{a legacy of the}} past, when forest landscapes were less intensively managed. We conclude that the long-term persistence of aspen in protected areas can only be secured by means of restoration measures that create gaps large enough for regeneration to occur. More emphasis should be given to sparing aspen during thinning and to retaining mature aspen during regeneration cutting in <b>managed</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
500|$|The park's attractions include {{naturalized}} plantings {{that are}} inspired by the landscape that grew on the disused tracks, and views {{of the city and}} the Hudson River. The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon.

40|$|Although {{protected}} areas {{are central to}} global biodiversity conservation, off-reserve forests are increasingly recognized as potentially important {{for the long term}} conservation of biota, particularly in less-developed countries where communities rely directly on resources from natural areas. We assessed the conservation value of differently <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> for birds in lowland tropical forests of Nepal. In particular, we explored whether their conservation value was additional or complementary to those of formal {{protected areas}}. Using data collected from 112 sites in protected areas (n = 31), state <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> (n = 37) and community <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> (n = 44), we assessed how bird species richness, abundance, diversity and community composition varied among tenures. Although sites in protected areas had the greatest species diversity, community <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> supported a complementary assemblage. Of 124 species recorded, only 45 % were common to all management tenures. Overall, the distinctiveness and richness of species in sites in forests outside of protected areas contributed substantially to regional avifaunal diversity. These results highlight the potentially critical role of appropriately <b>managed</b> community <b>forests.</b> The maintenance of diverse bird assemblages in forest regions depends on complementary management of forests both outside and inside the established protected areas...|$|R

40|$|What makes virgin forests better forests? Biodiversity {{evaluation}} {{depends on}} the value systems of the stakeholders involved. Indicators for conservation value, ecosystem functions, wilderness, uniqueness, or species richness may not correlate, or even correlate negatively. Based on arthropod data from a comparative study in two types of virgin forests in core areas of the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve in Ukraine and <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> in Switzerland with matching tree species composition, several biodiversity aspects and their underlying value systems are presented and discussed. There {{were no significant differences}} in species richness between virgin and <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b> Most arthropod groups tended to be more divers in <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> while saproxylic beetles, and fungi, millipedes and molluscs were more divers in virgin forests. The most obvious assets of virgin forests in terms of biodiversity values are wilderness and uniqueness. The conservation value, focussing on rare and threatened species, seems to be of lesser importance in Central European virgin forests. Other values of forest biodiversity such as species richness and ecosystem functions are unsuitable for valorising virgin forests in comparison to <b>managed</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study reviews carbon {{stocks and}} carbon {{dynamics}} {{in different types}} of forest land in Italy: ordinary <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> forest plantations, old growth forests, and trees outside forests. Forest management, combined with global environmental changes, increases the capacity of carbon uptake of ordinary <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b> Forest plantations, particularly the ones subject to short-rotation forestry systems,potentially have high soil carbon accumulation, especially in agricultural lands. Old growth forests, recently discovered as a carbon sink, cover a significant surface area in Italy. Moreover, the trees outside forests may represent a sensible carbon stock, especially {{in the context of}} urban environments. Our study points out the management actions that can be implemented in Italy to increase the carbon stocks of different forest ecosystems, such as increasing the mean annual increment in <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> enhancement of the national network of old growth forests, and expansion of forest plantations in suitable areas. These aspects have important implications after the recent recognition of the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector in the EU target within the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework...|$|R

40|$|Lesson One from <b>Managing</b> <b>forests</b> {{as common}} {{property}}: Common property of forests {{does not mean}} Access for All. The common property approach is being propounded as a responsible method of sustainable forest management. Yet, as these case studies from India, Zimbabwe and East Asia point out, access to forest resources must be regulated, to avoid over-exploitation. The book reviews common property as a system of governance, and examines traditional systems that have survived or disappeared. Its tentative analysis of the factors for success or failure emphasises the need for 'ownership' and strong local institutions, as well as enforceable legislation. <b>Managing</b> <b>forests</b> as common property.

30|$|In Fennoscandia, it {{has been}} shown how the loss of natural {{structural}} elements in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> has led to the decline of biodiversity (Auvinen et al. 2007; Kuuluvainen and Siitonen 2013). For example, in Finnish <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> the decline of dead wood amounts is estimated to be the main cause of species becoming threatened for one-third of the threatened forest species (over 500 species) (Rassi et al. 2010). In Finnish <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> there are on average 4 – 6  m 3 ∙ha−[*] 1 of dead wood, which is less than 10 % of natural levels (Siitonen 2001). Obviously such low levels of dead wood are below the threshold of species that demand more natural deadwood habitat conditions (Nordén et al. 2013). The national and European Union -level ambitions to increase forest biomass harvesting to replace fossil fuels would likely lead to further decline in dead wood and related diversity in forests, as well as the forest carbon store and sink in short term at least (Helmisaari et al. 2014; EASAC 2017). Notably the dead wood levels in the <b>managed</b> boreal <b>forests</b> of eastern Canada are much higher compared with Fennoscandia, apparently due to differences in management and natural legacies (Table 1). However, these natural legacies of dead wood will probably decay and diminish with time and intensifying management, as has happened in Fennoscandian <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
