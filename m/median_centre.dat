40|$|A new {{gradient}} operator for greyscale {{images is}} proposed, {{the output of}} {{which is based on}} the <b>median</b> <b>centred</b> difference of the intensities within a local mask. The operator is a simplified form of the robust colour morphological gradient and, as such, is robust to impulsive noise and provides well-localised gradient estimates. A quantitative evaluation using simulated images shows that the new operator is particularly suitable for the watershed transform, producing significantly better watershed segmentation results than conventional edge operators such as the morphological gradient and the Sobel...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT i. e., I(X) =X. The result Y {{of a set}} or {{function}} X filtered by an open-closing is denoted as: Y=ϕγ(X). We define the following group of transformations as composite morphological filters (CMFs) : In this paper, two pairs of dual morphological filters, the composite morphological filters (CMFs) are introduced. They have distinctive properties comparing with other similar morphological operations. CMFs are used to construct a directional morphological filter in impulsive noise removal procedures. It is proven that it has better noise-removal and detail-preserving abilities than classical morphological filters and other non-linear filters such as <b>median</b> or <b>centre</b> weighted <b>median</b> based filters. A threshold scheme is added to improve the final filtering performances. (1) ϕ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Image {{filtering}} {{techniques are}} widely used in removing noises in images. But representation of data is becoming popular day by day using compound images. So, noise removal is necessary to maintain {{the quality of the}} compound images. Noise can be added to the compound images during image acquisition, image capturing or image transmission. Different literature study shows that many filtering techniques are presented to remove noise or improve the quality of the corrupted images. This paper deals with the performance study of Median, Relaxed <b>median,</b> Wiener, <b>Centre</b> weighted <b>median</b> and Averaging filters to remove Salt and pepper, Gaussian and Speckle noise in the compound images. This paper proposes relaxed median filter performs better for compound images...|$|R

This is {{a parliamentary}} monitoring tool {{focused on the}} Romanian Chamber of Deputies and organised around four dimensions: Members of the Chamber and their work, Public Policy domains, Parliamentary Party Groups (PPGs) and Data Export. The application tracks the policy specialisation and the engagement in local interest representation of each MP and enables users to compare the activity of their representatives (one-to-one and one-to-all). Moreover, Parlament Transparent allows specialised NGOs and ordinary citizens {{to keep track of}} the latest legislative developments in 15 policy areas.

40|$|A super-mean filter (SUMF) is {{proposed}} to remove high density salt & pepper noise from digital images. The proposed filter works in two stages, {{in the first}} stage the noisy pixels are detected and in the second stage each noisy pixel is replaced by the mean value of noise free pixel of 2 × 2 matrix. Extensive simulation and experimental results shows that the proposed filter works well consistently for suppressing the salt & pepper noise. The performance of proposed filter is compared with the other existing filters, standard <b>median</b> filter(SMF), <b>centre</b> weighted <b>median</b> filter (CWMF), progressive switching median filter (PSMF), open-close sequence filter (OCSF), decision based algorithm (DBA), modified decision based unsymmetric trimmed median filter (MDBUTMF).
