2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was <b>mousseline.</b> The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E

60|$|Ida {{was in her}} boudoir, a {{tiny little}} tapestried room, as neat and dainty as herself, with low walls hung with Imari plaques and with pretty little Swiss {{brackets}} bearing blue Kaga ware, or the pure white Coalport china.

A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and {{springing}} down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light <b>mousseline</b> de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.|$|E

Mrs. Hasluck was the type of woman to have escaped observation, even had the wedding been her own; that she was present at her daughter's, [...] "becomingly dressed in grey veiling spotted white, with an encrustation of <b>mousseline</b> de soie," [...] I learnt the next day from the Morning Post. Old Hasluck himself had to be fetched every time he was wanted. At the conclusion of the ceremony, seeking him, I found him sitting on the stairs leading to the crypt.|$|E

50|$|Custard-based buttercream (also {{known as}} German buttercream, light buttercream, crème <b>mousseline,</b> and Bavarian buttercream) is {{prepared}} by beating together a thick type of custard called pastry cream and softened butter, {{and may be}} additionally sweetened with extra confectioners' sugar.

50|$|Muslin (AmE: Muslin gauze) from French <b>mousseline,</b> from Italian mussolina, from Mussolo ‘Mosul’ (Mosul, Iraq, where European traders {{are said}} to have first {{encountered}} the cloth). Although this view has the fabric named after the city where Europeans first encountered it (Mosul), the fabric is believed to have originated in Dhakeshwari, now Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh. In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman made note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhmi in Arabic). Bengali muslin was traded throughout the Muslim world, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. In many Islamic regions, such as in Central Asia, the cloth was named Daka, after the city of Dhaka.|$|E
5000|$|In US usage, {{there are}} four basic styles of forcemeat. Straight forcemeats are {{produced}} by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat.

[...] Country-style forcemeats are a combination of pork, pork fat, often {{with the addition of}} pork liver and garnish ingredients. The finished product has a coarse texture.The third style is gratin which has a portion of the main protein browned; the French term gratin connotes a [...] "grated" [...] product that is browned. The final style is <b>mousseline,</b> which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from veal, poultry, fish, or shellfish. The resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat.|$|E

La Tante Claire moved to The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, London in 1998, with the former site being sold to become the flagship restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. During his time at La Tante Claire, Koffmann worked with several eminent chefs, including Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing and Tom Kitchin. He did not get on with Wareing, who made his feelings felt about Koffmann in Simon Wright's book Tough Cookies, saying of Koffmann, [...] "Three-star kitchen! This guy didn't tell you anything. He didn't {{tell you what the}} lunch menu was, he didn't tell you where to get anything… You didn't know if you were coming or going… I could not click with the man.", although more recently Wareing speaks better of Koffmann, saying [...] "Koffmann is a complete thoroughbred.

50|$|A consommé is made {{by adding}} a mixture of ground meats, {{together}} with mirepoix (a combination of carrots, celery, and onion), tomatoes, and egg whites into either bouillon or stock. The key to making a high quality consommé is simmering; the act of simmering, combined with frequent stirring, brings impurities {{to the surface of}} the liquid, which are further drawn out due to the presence of acid from the tomatoes. Eventually, the solids begin to congeal at the surface of the liquid, forming a 'raft', which is caused by the proteins in the egg whites. Once the 'raft' begins to form, the heat is reduced, and the consommé is simmered at a lower heat until it reaches the desired flavor, which usually takes anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour. The resulting concoction is a clear liquid that has either a rich amber colour (for beef or veal consommé) or a very pale yellow colour (for poultry consommé). It is then carefully drawn from the pot and passed again through a filter to ensure its purity, and is then put through a lengthy process where all of the visible fat is skimmed from the surface. To ensure total purification, the consommé can be refrigerated, which draws out remaining fat, which can easily be skimmed off with a cheesecloth. Alternatively, the consommé can be placed in a wide, shallow container such as a sauté pan or large bowl and wide strips of parchment paper can be dragged along the surface; the tiny amounts of remaining fat adhere to the parchment, leaving the consommé perfectly de-greased. Cartilage and tendons should be left on the meat because of the gelatin they contain, which enhances the mouthfeel of the soup. If beef or veal is used, shin meat is ideal because it is very low in fat and very high in gristle, and although it is undesirable for most other purposes, it is near essential for the flavour of the consommé. The meat is best if it is ground very fine, as if for a <b>mousseline.</b>|$|E
