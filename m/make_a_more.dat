5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s CDOT began {{considering}} {{plans for a}} replacement bridge. The major issue was whether a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> direct connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred. It remained {{to decide whether to}} have a signalized intersection or a roundabout at the intersection of Sixth Street and Laurel Avenue.|$|E

Companies could apply for OT work or could be conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E

Luxembourg hosts the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the European Investment Bank. Strasbourg hosts the office of the European Ombudsman. The other agencies are spread across Europe and since the 2004 enlargement, there has been a drive to locate more agencies in the new member-states to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> equal distribution.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
