25|$|The BAe 146 was {{the second}} {{aircraft}}, after the Concorde, to use carbon brakes. The aircraft features a low amount of composite material, used {{in parts of the}} secondary structure only. Initial production aircraft featured a conventional cockpit and <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> controls. At launch, the onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) consumed only half the fuel and weighed only a third as much as other contemporary models.|$|E
25|$|A {{fly-by-wire}} (FBW) system replaces <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> {{control of}} an aircraft {{with an electronic}} interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems {{are part of the}} field known as avionics.|$|E
25|$|Before {{boarding}} the simulators, each rider {{is assigned}} an on-board role (navigator, pilot, commander, or engineer) and given two tasks to perform during the mission (pressing a specific button when prompted). For example, {{one of the}} commander's buttons initiates the rocket's first-stage separation, and the other activates <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> control. The spacecraft's on-board self-automated pilot will perform each task if the rider does not respond {{to his or her}} prompt from Mission Control or if there is no one to perform the task. Also featured are various labeled buttons and switches which the rider may play with but do nothing; they are only there to add to the realism aspect of the ride.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the KC-767 has <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> {{controls}} with an unrestricted flight envelope. [...] The Boeing tanker officially {{received the}} KC-767A designation from the U.S. DoD in 2002 and {{that appeared in}} the 2004 edition of the DoD Model Designation report.|$|E

2500|$|The NTSB further {{determined}} that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness of the pilot flying's actions {{around the time of}} the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance. [...] Lack of compliance with standard operating procedures and crew resource management were cited as additional factors.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 February 2007, Boeing {{announced}} it was offering the KC-767 Advanced Tanker for the KC-X Tanker competition. Boeing stated that for KC-X's requirements, the KC-767 was a better fit than the KC-777. On 11 April 2007, Boeing submitted its KC-767 tanker proposal to U.S. Air Force. The KC-767 Advanced Tanker offered for this KC-X round {{was based on the}} in-development 767-200LRF (Long Range Freighter), rather than the -200ER on which Italian and Japanese KC-767 aircraft are based differing by combining the -200ER fuselage, -300F wing, gear, cargo door and floor, -400ER digital flightdeck and flaps, uprated engines, and [...] "sixth-generation" [...] fly-by-wire fuel delivery boom. The KC-767 uses <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> control, allowing unrestricted maneuverability to avoid threats anywhere in the flight envelope.|$|E
2500|$|The crew made {{no attempt}} to balance the airplane’s fuel load after the No. 1 engine failed. [...] The DC-6 is {{equipped}} with four main fuel tanks that serve individual engines, while a network of valves allow fuel to be transferred from one engine’s tank to feed other engines. The crew did not cross feed fuel from the tank serving the failed engine to balance the plane's weight as recommended in the flight operations <b>manual.</b> <b>Flight</b> 157 had flown for almost three hours with the No. 1 engine out, and the CAB concluded that the No. 1 main fuel tank was holding about 1,400lbs (635kg) more gasoline than the other three main tanks when the plane arrived at Love Field. The investigators primarily attributed the left wing’s sharp drop to the excessive weight of the fuel at its outboard end.|$|E

2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; <b>manual</b> <b>flight</b> mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway {{and whether or not they}} were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.|$|E
