5000|$|The last {{development}} of M42 lenses was {{the introduction of}} a link between camera and lens to transmit the lens aperture setting, which allowed light metering with the aperture remaining wide open. The means of doing this was not standardised, Praktica's method was to use an electrical connection which transmitted a variable resistance value to the camera's metering circuit. Asahi Pentax developed an additional lever on the lens which operated a variable resistor in the camera mount. These mechanisms spurred the use of electronic shutters linked to the metering circuit, allowing for automated shutter speed selection by the camera (aperture priority). M42 cameras with wide open <b>metering</b> <b>facility</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|Canon's sudden {{switch from}} professionally {{oriented}} SLR cameras to advanced amateur cameras happened in March 1964 {{when they left}} the Canon Canonflex range and launched the Canon FX with the FL lens mount. It has a built in CdS exposure meter with a circular window on the right-hand camera front. The Canon FP without exposure meter was added later the same year. The cameras were well built, but the metering technology was several years behind the Minolta SR-7 which pioneered that technology in 1962. Then just half a year later, in the spring of 1965 Canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable Pellix. The new camera featured the much-expected TTL exposure <b>metering</b> <b>facility,</b> albeit employing the stop-down metering method.|$|E
50|$|The Chiayi {{waterway}} {{was constructed}} between July 1911 and March 1914 {{as part of}} the city waterway facilities. The room which houses the <b>metering</b> <b>facility</b> to measure the water flow was built in 1910 as the Water Meter Room. In 1954, water plants around Chiayi County (which then include Chiayi City at that time) were combined into the Chiayi Water Plant, with the exception of Puzi Water Plant. The Water Meter Room was then also renamed as Water Source Water Meter Room. The land where the meter room is located belongs to the forestry industry and {{due to the lack of}} access road to the room building, it was covered with plants and trees. However, due to the road widening nearby the structure, the meter room was revealed.|$|E

50|$|The {{design is}} based on the {{innovative}} Minolta SR-7 model V camera of 1962, but the principal design is inherited from the original 1958 Minolta SR-2. The SR-T 101 however, has several significant features apart from the TTL meter. The most significant one is perhaps the full aperture <b>metering</b> <b>facility,</b> automatically compensating for the at any time fitted lens' maximum aperture, a feature it took twelve more years for Nikon to accomplish. Full aperture TTL metering was commercially first realised in the brilliant Tokyo Kogaku Topcon RE Super, a feature first realised in a screw mount camera by the introduction of the Olympus Kogaku Olympus FTL, their first full frame 35mm SLR in 1971, but which was abandoned one year later in favour of the remarkable OM system.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{development}} in gas industry has caused gradual increase {{of natural gas}} demand in the Malaysian market, which indirectly has drawn peopleâ€™s attention {{to the price of}} natural gas and the accuracy gas measuring devices. The price of natural gas is a matter of supply and demand, while the determination of the accuracy of gas measuring devices is a matter of technology that is to be discussed in this paper. The aspect of calibration is a paramount factor in determining the accuracy of any measuring device.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} soft sensor to {{estimate}} phase flow rates utilizing common measurements {{in oil and}} gas production wells. The developed system addresses the limited production monitoring due to using common <b>metering</b> <b>facilities.</b> It offers a cost-effective solution to meet real-time monitoring demands, reduces operational and maintenance costs, and acts as a back-up to multiphase flow meters. The soft sensor is developed using feed-forward neural network, and generalization and network complexity are regulated using K-fold cross-validation and early stopping technique. The soft sensor is validated using actual well test data from producing wells, and model performance is analyzed using cumulative deviation and cumulative flow plots. The developed soft sensor shows promising performance with a mean absolute percent error of around 4 % and less than 10 % deviation for 90 % of the samples...|$|R
