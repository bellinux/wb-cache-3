About 4.5 km long, it stretches in north-south direction. It lies on the sandy terrain between Danube and Tisza rivers, at the borderline of Bačka loessial plateau. Its northern part is wider and swampy, while the southern part is embedded into loess, with shores 3-4 m high. The bottom of the lake is made of <b>watertight</b> <b>layer</b> of white clay, covered with mud. The water is shallow, with the average depth of just 1 m and reaching the maximum depth of 2.25 m. The lake freezes up to three months a year, and in the summer its temperature can reach as high as [...]|$|R
40|$|In brief, {{the rules}} for {{building}} watertight masonry are given in this paper as follows: 1. All the joints should be grouted completely; each brick should be surrounded by an unbroken <b>watertight</b> <b>layer</b> of mortar. 2. The brick should have a water suction of between 10 and 30 gm. when one of its flat sides is immersed 3 mm. in water for one minute. More porous facing bricks must be soaked. 3. A mortar, which has a high cement content and which is mixed in a mixer at the building site, should be used. A suitable mixture, in parts by volume, is as follows: 1 cement + 1 lime + 6 - 7 sand or 1 cement + 1 / 2 lime + 4. 5 - 5 sand. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies and}} the repair works that were carried out on the railway bridge of Monts Reials in Sòller, which is the main city in the north-west coast of Mallorca, are described. The bridge {{presents}} five barrel vaults spanning eight meters with a width of 3. 6 m and a depth of 0. 60 m. The bridge was in a general good condition except for the first arch which presented some significant cracks, including very wide transversal cracks close to the abutments and spalling of the brick fabric just under the key of the arch. The assessment of the arch included the review of design documentation, full geometrical characterization of the arch, dynamic load tests and finite element analysis to check {{the capacity of the}} arch and interpret the causes of the damage. Repair works consisted of grouting of the arch ring, particularly in the cracks, repointing of the intrados of the barrel vault and the voussoirs and a <b>watertight</b> <b>layer</b> on the extrados.

50|$|Coventry {{used her}} 4.5-inch gun and small arms against the attacking aircraft. The port Oerlikon 20 mm cannon jammed, leaving the ship with only rifles and machine guns to defend herself. Coventry {{was struck by}} three bombs just above the water line on the port side. One of the bombs {{exploded}} beneath the computer room, destroying it and the nearby operations room, incapacitating almost all senior officers. The other entered the forward engine room, exploding beneath the junior ratings dining room where the first aid party was stationed, and the ship immediately began listing to port. The latter hit caused critical damage as it breached the bulkhead between the forward and aft engine rooms, exposing the largest open space in the ship to uncontrollable flooding. Given {{the design of the}} ship, with <b>multiple</b> <b>watertight</b> compartments, two hits virtually anywhere else might have been just survivable. The third bomb did not explode.|$|R
40|$|Water ingress in {{transportation}} tunnels {{not only will}} shorten the durability of concrete lining and reduce the function of establishments in the tunnel, but also will worsen the tunnel surrounding {{so much that the}} traffic will be greatly affected. In this situation, therefore, high maintenance costs are compulsory. In many cases, a perfect appearance is strongly recommended to take measures in order to prevent leakage. However, in China, tunnel waterproof requirements and standards for various special uses are considerably different, such that the basis which engineers apply to design in water-control is insufficient. Especially in montanic region, unpleasant geological condition confines engineers in working out more reasonable methods to stop water seepage, even leakage. In this paper, the current waterproofing requirements and measures in different special tunnels adopted in China are reviewed. The limitations of the popular methods in several practical cases applied to prevent water leakage, such as watertight lining, drainage system, as well as grouting, are analyzed at length. Then, some available measures, regarding concrete lining, <b>watertight</b> <b>layer,</b> drainage establishments as well as casting watertight concrete, are proposed, which we think indispensable for tunnel engineering to efficiently control water seepage and even completely prevent water leakage. In the end, to analyze the seepage field in montanic tunnels, the finite element and boundary element coupling analysis method is presented. As an example, the seepage field in Zhenwushan tunnel of Chongqing is simulated. The calculation results coincide with the in-situ data well, and provide credible evidence for the waterproof measures which will be taken in that tunnel project. The method presented in this paper will save expenditures for surveying measures and will enable more reasonable and reliable waterproofing measures to be taken.

5000|$|The {{industrial}} revolution {{made possible the}} use of new materials and designs that radically altered shipbuilding. Iron was gradually adopted in ship construction, initially in discrete areas in a wooden hull needing greater strength, (e.g. as deck knees, hanging knees, knee riders and the other sharp joints, ones in which a curved, progressive joint could not be achieved). Then, {{in the form of}} plates riveted together and made watertight, it was used to form the hull itself. Initially copying wooden construction traditions with a frame over which the hull was fastened, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] of 1843 was the first radical new design, being built entirely of wrought iron. Despite her success, and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull, compared to a copper sheathed counterpart, there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles. As a result, composite construction remained the dominant approach where fast ships were required, with wooden timbers laid over an iron frame (Cutty Sark is a famous example). Later Great Britains iron hull was sheathed in wood to enable it to carry a copper-based sheathing. Brunel's [...] represented the next great development in shipbuilding. Built in association with John Scott Russell, it used longitudinal s for strength, inner and outer hulls, and bulkheads to form <b>multiple</b> <b>watertight</b> compartments. Steel also supplanted wrought iron when it became readily available {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century, providing great savings when compared with iron in cost and weight. Wood continued to be favored for the decks.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District {{approved}} {{additional funding}} for the Milwaukee Public Library to construct a green roof. The new green roof replaces the roof built in 1986. The green roof uses a <b>watertight</b> membrane, protective <b>layer,</b> insulation, a filter layer, soil and vegetation to create a roof system. In addition, photovoltaic cells have been installed to convert solar energy into direct current electricity. The green roof is expected to reduce polluted stormwater runoff, urban heat islands and improve air quality. In the long term, Milwaukee is expected to benefit from reduced costs for water treatment systems and infrastructure. Public tours of the green roof are available on a seasonal basis.|$|R
25|$|The {{floor of}} the tank was {{watertight}} due to finely fitted bricks and mud laid on edge {{with a kind of}} plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more <b>watertight,</b> a thick <b>layer</b> of bitumen (waterproof tar) was laid along the sides of the pool and presumably also on the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns had stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms were located along {{the eastern edge of the}} building and in one room was a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for this purpose, but no inlet drains have been found.It had a long bathing pool built with waterproof bricks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{practical}} feasibility of an exterior air barrier {{for the construction}} of a recently constructed light weight passive house in Ghent, Belgium. The paper discusses the results of pressurisation tests, conducted in the different construction stages of the building envelope. The windbreaker, which will also act as an air barrier, consists of bituminous mixed wood fibres plates with a <b>watertight</b> bitumen impregnated <b>layer</b> on the top face. Measurements have been performed with and without sealing the joints. In addition to in situ pressurisation tests of the entire building, laboratory measurements on specimens of the windbreaker including typical joints were carried out in order to quantify the influence of possible local air leakages. The measurements indicate that the external wind barrier contributes significantly to the final airtightness of the tested building. In this case study, sealing only the most critical joints of the outer shell already leads to a level of airtightness of the whole building envelope which fulfils the requirements of the passive house standard (less than 0, 6 air changes per hour (ACH) at 50 Pa). The results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed solution has a potential to reduce labour costs required to reach a sufficient level of airtightness. status: publishe...|$|R
