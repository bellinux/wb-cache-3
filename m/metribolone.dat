Similar findings were observed for ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, {{it appears that the}} ethynyl group of NET at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metribolone</b> was {{identified}} in 2010 as a potent inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) 1 and 2 (IC50 = 0.02 and 0.16 μM, respectively).

50|$|<b>Metribolone</b> is an AAS, or an agonist of the AR, {{with both}} {{anabolic}} and androgenic activity. It {{is one of}} the most potent AAS to have ever been synthesized, with 120 to 300 times the oral anabolic potency and 60 to 70 times the androgenic potency of the reference AAS methyltestosterone in castrated male rats, although the same level of potency was not subsequently seen in later studies in humans. In addition to the AR, <b>metribolone</b> has high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as well. <b>Metribolone</b> has a high potential for hepatotoxicity, similarly to other 17α-alkylated AAS. However, the hepatotoxic potential of <b>metribolone</b> appears to be exceptionally high, likely in relation to its very high potency and metabolic stability; in a study of treatment with the drug for advanced breast cancer, severe hepatic dysfunction was observed at very low dosages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metribolone</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the literature in 1965.

The drug was found to be effective and showed weak androgenicity, but also produced severe signs of hepatotoxicity, and was ultimately never marketed. By the mid-1970s, <b>metribolone</b> was becoming an accepted standard as a ligand and agonist of the AR in scientific research. It remains in wide use for this purpose today. Aside from scientific research, <b>metribolone</b> has also been encountered as an AAS in non-medical contexts, for instance in doping in sports and bodybuilding.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to testosterone, which has high affinity for ZIP9 with a Kd of 14 nM, the other endogenous androgens dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione show low {{affinity for the}} receptor with less than 1% of that of testosterone, although DHT is still effective in activating the receptor at sufficiently high concentrations. Moreover, the synthetic androgens mibolerone and <b>metribolone</b> (R-1881), the endogenous androgen 11-ketotestoterone, and the other steroid hormones estradiol and cortisol are all ineffective competitors for the receptor. As such, mibolerone and <b>metribolone</b> could potentially be employed to differentiate between androgen receptor- and ZIP9-mediated responses of testosterone.|$|E
50|$|Mibolerone, {{also known}} as 7α,17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone (DMNT) or as 7α,17α-dimethylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is the 17α-methyl derivative of trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT).

50|$|Although very potent in both {{activities}} in vitro, the AR/PR activational potency ratio of altrenogest {{was in the}} same range as that of other 19-nortestosterone progestins such as norethisterone, noretynodrel, norgestrel, and allylestrenol (ratio for all < 1.0), whereas the AR/PR activational potency ratio of its 17α-deallylated AAS analogue trenbolone was, at 64, profoundly increased (although the ratio of <b>metribolone</b> (the 17α-methylated variant of altrenogest), at 0.56, was almost {{the same as that of}} altrenogest).|$|E

It is a modification of gestrinone (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) in which the ethynyl group has been hydrogenated into an ethyl group, thereby converting the steroid from a norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with weak AR activity into a norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with powerful AR activity.

50|$|Trimethyltrienolone (developmental {{code name}} R-2956 or RU-2956), or 2α,2β,17α-trimethyltrenbolone, {{also known as}} 2α,2β,17α-trimethylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} derived from testosterone that was first described in 1973 {{and was one of}} the earliest antiandrogens to be discovered and developed. It is a derivative of the extremely potent anabolic-androgenic steroid <b>metribolone</b> (R-1881; 17α-methyltrenbolone), and possesses only about 4-fold lower competitive affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) in comparison. Trimethyltrienolone is a powerful and selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) with very low intrinsic androgenic activity and no estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or progestogenic activity. The drug almost completely inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding to the AR in vitro at a mere 10-fold molar excess. It was under investigation for potential clinical use, but was abandoned in favor of nonsteroidal antiandrogens like flutamide and nilutamide due to their comparative advantage of a complete lack of androgenicity, and hence, was never marketed.|$|E
40|$|Gymnosis is {{the process}} of the {{delivery}} of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to cells, {{in the absence of any}} carriers or conjugation, that produces sequence-specific gene silencing. While gymnosis was originally demonstrated using locked nucleic acid (LNA) gapmers, 2 ′-deoxy- 2 ′fluoroarabino nucleic acid (2 ′F-ANA) phosphorothioate gapmer oligonucleotides (oligos) when targeted to the Bcl- 2 and androgen receptor (AR) mRNAs in multiple cell lines in tissue culture, are approximately as effective at silencing of Bcl- 2 expression as the iso-sequential LNA congeners. In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, gymnotic silencing of the AR by a 2 ′F-ANA phosphorothioate gapmer oligo led to downstream silencing of cellular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression even in the presence of the androgenic steroid R 1881 (<b>metribolone),</b> which stabilizes cytoplasmic levels of the AR. Furthermore, gymnotic silencing occurs in the absence of serum, and silencing by both LNA and 2 ′F-ANA oligos is augmented in serum-free (SF) media in some cell lines when they are treated with oleic acid and a variety of ω- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω- 6 PUFAs), but not by an aliphatic (palmitic) fatty acid. These results significantly expand our understanding of and ability to successfully manipulate the cellular delivery of single-stranded oligos in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The binding of ten steroids {{possessing}} antiglucocorticoid {{activity has}} been studied in rat skeletal muscle cytosol. The affinity of these steroids for both the androgen and the glucocorticoid receptors was determined by competition with radioactive R 1881 (methyltrienolone, <b>metribolone)</b> and dexamethasone, respectively. The antiglucocorticoid activity of these compounds was assessed in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells by measuring their inhibitory effect on the glucocorticoid-induced tyrosine aminotransferase activity. This led to identification of five novel in vitro glucocorticoid antagonists. All the steroids tested bound to both the glucocorticoid and the androgen receptors in muscle. Four steroids had an affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor higher than for the androgen receptor. The assumption is made that the steroids tested also behave as antagonists when binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in muscle and behave as agonists when binding to the androgen receptor. On this basis, the data allow one to compute a potential anticatabolic (PAG) and a potential anabolic (PAA) index for each compound. These indices might be of predictive value to determine whether these steroids exert their anabolic action in muscle through the glucocorticoid receptor or through the androgen receptor. The data also make it unlikely that satellite cells are a preferential target for anabolic steroids in muscle...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this report is to develop and characterize a cell-based androgen reporter assay. For this purpose, the androgen receptor (AR) expressing human breast cancer cell line T 47 D was stably transfected with a luciferase gene under transcriptional control of the PB-ARE- 2 androgen response element. The application of this cell line in an endogenous Androgen Receptor-mediated LUciferase eXpression assay (AR-LUX) was validated. An EC 50 value of 86 pM was determined for the standard androgen R 1881 with a detection limit of 46 pM. Other androgens like dihydrotestosterone, 17 β-trenbolone, and bolasterone also induced luciferase expression, while anti-androgens suppressed these responses. As expected, AR-mediated responses were also elicited by high concentrations of the steroids progesterone, 17 β-estradiol, d-aldosterone, and dexamethasone, with observed EC 50 values 10 to 350, 000 times higher than that for R 1881. A unique feature of the AR-LUX assay is that effects on modulation of active endogenous AR-levels are reliably reflected in the luciferase induction response, as exemplified by vitamin D, all-trans-retinoic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, and forskolin. This feature is especially useful when assessing complex mixtures, e. g., environmental samples or natural compound libraries. From these data it is concluded that the AR-LUX assay is a reliable in vitro test system for the detection and quantification of AR-mediated biological effects. The 96 -well plate format makes the assay particularly suitable for high-throughput screening.
