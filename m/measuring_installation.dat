The maeasuring device is designed for usage at places where other thermal map scanning measuring methods (e. g. thermocamera) can not be used. The key objective was to design an appropriate measuring method for selected type of sensor. This method should ensure the most effective detection of the changing value, translate received values to the digital form {{and send it to}} the computer. All circuits were powered over USB (Universal Serial Bus) together with the signalling. Calibration was needed due to different sensors technical parameters. The calibration was realized on the software level and displayed with the thermal map scanning on the computer.

40|$|The European Union (EU) has set ammonia {{emission}} restrictions {{for the different}} member states. To comply with the new regulations, the EU wants new techniques such as adapted feeding strategies and low emission building techniques to reduce {{ammonia emission}}s from livestock buildings. However, such ammonia restriction measures are only useful when their efficiency {{can be measured in}} the field. Current reliable measuring techniques are mainly based on continuous measurements over a long period (up to 200 days), and this requires expensive equipment. This makes them unsuitable for permanent evaluation on a large number of buildings. The main objective of the study presented here was the development of a procedure to determine NH 3 emissions from livestock buildings in the field, based on a limited number of measuring days.

40|$|The {{experimental}} measuring {{of working}} loads upon {{the parts of}} rotating excavator is a complicated procedure given {{the complexity of the}} construction of the excavator and the specificity of exploitation conditions. Therefore, there are no uniform solutions and methods for this purpose, and any proposed solution is of great benefit to excavator users, as well to science studying this issue. This paper presents a preset methodology for measuring working loads of the clamp dogs on the carrying structure of the working wheel at the excavator used in surface coal mining. This methodology uses the default settings implicit to the strain gage method, which records the stresses resulting from external loads occurring within the clamp dogs’ material using strain gages and measuring equipment. Within this concept, the paper shows the manner of determining the measuring points and setting up the strain gages on both clamp dogs, the connecting with the <b>measuring</b> <b>installation</b> and the equipment.

40|$|Introduction. Measurement of {{resistance}} of the grounding device (GD) {{by means of a}} three-electrode system. This requires not only the right choice of installation locations of measuring electrodes, but also the determination of the point of zero potential. Implementation of these requirements quite time-consuming, and in some cases impossible. Aim. Develop a new technique for measuring the electrical {{resistance of the}} GD. Task. The method of measuring the resistance of the GD {{with the help of a}} three-electrode setup is necessary to exclude the determination of the point of zero potential. Method. Mathematical modeling and calculation engine. Results. A three-electrode system for measuring the resistance of grounding devices (GD) for various purposes is considered. On the basis of Maxwell equations a theoretical substantiation of a new technique for measuring the resistance of any GD of any construction in random soil structure has been proposed. An equation system of the sixth order has been obtained, its solution makes it possible to measure its own mutual resistance in the three-electrode installation with sufficiently high accuracy. Peculiarities of drawing up a calculation scheme of substitution of a three-electrode installation with lumped parameters: self and mutual impedance. Use of the principle of reciprocity eliminates the need of finding a point of zero potential which is a rather difficult task. The technique allows to minimize the spacing of measuring electrodes outside the GD, which substantially reduces the length of wiring of the measurement circuit and increases the «signal-to-interference» ratio and also removes the restrictions on the development of the territory outside the GD being tested. Conclusion. The procedure allows to evaluate the self and mutual impedance grounding all the electrodes in a three-electrode <b>measuring</b> <b>installation</b> of the grounding resistance of the device without finding the point of zero potential...|$|E

The purpose is to develop the experimental-and-analytical computing method of displacements and deformations of rocks and surface in extraction of steeply deeping coal seams for improvement of preventive <b>measures</b> of <b>installations</b> under the complex mine-geological conditions. The dependence in the displacement determination, which takes account of factor of longitudinal displacement of rocks, has been ascertained; the prediction manner of desplacements and deformations of rocks and surface in mining of steeply deeping coal seams has been offered.

40|$|As {{described}} in Chapter EE- 4, the “neighborhood blitz ” {{is one example}} of an innovative program strategy targeting retrofit opportunities in the residential market. Low-income households have been the recipients of comprehensive weatherization program efforts for 30 years, and numerous evaluations of these programs have demonstrated significant and durable energy savings from these efforts. Our analysis extends the low-income weatherization concept to non low-income programs, and estimates the statewide achievable potential from a large-scale effort to weatherize older housing stock. Such an effort could take the form of geographically-targeted “neighborhood blitzes ” with highly subsidized measures and turn-key <b>measure</b> <b>installation</b> increase uptake. However, other program approaches could also be viable. We used low-income weatherization program evaluation results to estimate the likely energy savings for high, medium, and low gas users. Percentage savings are highest for the first end user category and lowest for the last. We also assumed that such an effort would result in 15 percent electricity savings, of which two thirds of the savings could easily be delivered through a comprehensive direct-installation of CFLs. Since the intent of such site-intensive programs is to install as many measures as can be cost-justified, the savings and estimated costs are estimated such that the TRC is close to unity in all cases, with an assumption that repair and health-and-safety measure costs will be somewhat lower than those found i...|$|R
