Their son, Darius John Rubin, was born in 2000. Having previously lived in London, they moved back to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side. But in May 2013, Rubin announced that the family would return to London to work on several projects, and in October of the same year, Amanpour stated {{that she and her}} husband would be relocating to London permanently: [...] "Right now I'd have to say that London is my home...

2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade {{and we talk about}} our reading at meal times…".|$|E

Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E

40|$|Jim Wayne Miller, {{professor}} of English at Western Kentucky University, declared that school children in West Virginia have more exposure to other cultures {{than they do}} to their own. His concern was that, “Lack {{of knowledge about the}} area’s history helps perpetuate negative stereotypes about the region’s mountain people ” (Associated Press, 1994). If the Mountain Culture, to which many of the students belong, is not reflected in the curriculum, their identity, voice, heritage, history, and arts are censored and the Mountain Cultural youth are rendered invisible in their own state. Results from a survey of three elementary schools located in three counties in West Virginia served as the impetus to develop and implement curricular changes to include Mountain Culture. In this paper, I describe a case study of one elementary school’s use of social reconstruction pedagogy. The project, “Telling Our Story, ” was implemented in 1995 and 1996 at a rural school in a small West Virginia strip mining community. My husband, David, and I served as Mountain Cultural artists in residence. My role in this project was a participant-observer. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> from the Mountain 99 Mountain Cultural Curriculum Culture and learned our art forms from our elders in the home and/ or community.
