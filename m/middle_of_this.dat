5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 to examine whether the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W.

It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry {{said about the}} succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons {{to swear an oath}} of allegiance to her.|$|E
5|$|Although {{science fiction}} had been {{published}} in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback.

5|$|In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, {{through a}} process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century. Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The S segment {{consists}} of 1953bases, of which 1287 (starting at position 43) code for the nucleocapsid protein. In addition, a second 192-base {{open reading frame}} occurs in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sequence (starting at position 122), as in several other hantaviruses. Among three specimens of O.couesi, the sequence in this segment differed by only 1%, and all changes were silent mutations.

The nucleotide sequence differs by 24% from those viruses.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{complex is}} the part of the Taman Sari complex that is {{practically}} has no visible remains, except for a former hanging bridge and remains of a pier. The description of this area is retrieved from a reconstruction made from the 1812 English army sketch of the Yogyakarta kraton. This area extends about 600 meters to the east of the Segaran lake area. This area consisted of another artificial lake on the southeast of the Magangan complex toward the northeast of Siti Hinggil Kidul complex. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> artificial lake is another artificial island called Kinupeng Island (Javanese Pulo Kinupeng).

5|$|The {{last major}} Soviet offensive, opening in January, {{had a number}} of the fighter units were {{transferred}} from Reich Defence to defend the Eastern Front. JG52 was based in and around Breslau defending the vital Silesian industrial region with intercept and ground attack missions. An enormous effort managed to briefly stall the Soviet advance. The Luftwaffe flew 2500 sorties on 1 & 2 February alone. On 25 January, Hans-Ulrich Rudel destroyed his 500th tank while his unit was based with JG52. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Erich Hartmann was ordered to report for jet-training with Galland’s new JV 44. Strong protests by both Graf and Hartmann had this order rescinded.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the first}} exit with St. Paul Street, Ridge Road resurfaces as East Ridge Road, which {{parallels}} the expressway to the north. NY104 continues through Rochester and Irondequoit, connecting to North Clinton Avenue, Seneca Avenue, Hudson Avenue, Carter Street, Portland Avenue, North Goodman Street and Culver Road by way of interchanges. Between the Goodman Street and Culver Road exits, NY104 passes the former Medley Centre. East of Culver, NY104 encounters NY590 and connects to NY590 southbound by way of an interchange. East Ridge Road runs through the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> interchange, {{although there are no}} connections between Ridge and NY104. There is also no access from NY104 eastbound to NY590 northbound; eastbound traffic must take Culver Road in order to go north toward Sea Breeze. Just east of the NY590 interchange, NY104 becomes the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay by way of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. An access road between NY104 just west of the bridge and NY590 at Titus Avenue was once planned. Although entrance and exit ramps were built for the connection along NY104, the rest of the link was never built, leaving no access from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound and from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound.|$|E
