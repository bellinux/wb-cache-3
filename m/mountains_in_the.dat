5|$|The {{direction}} of Oregon stream flow {{is influenced by}} four major drainage divides: the Oregon Coast Range on the west, the Cascade Range further inland, the Klamath–Siskiyou <b>Mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest, and the Blue <b>Mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast. One set of streams, including the Nehalem River, flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the Deschutes River, flow into the Columbia River or its tributaries. A third set, including the Klamath River and its tributaries, originates in Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the Donner und Blitzen River flow into closed basins, such as Malheur Lake, that have no outlet to the sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tour de France {{had also been}} successful. After the {{introduction of}} the Vosges in the 1905 Tour de France, in 1906 the Massif Central were climbed, followed by the Pyrenees in 1910 and the Alps in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to activities run by individual Scout groups, {{a large number}} of rallies, activities, competitions, and training courses are held by the different Regions.

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|One legend {{states that}} when Andrew the Apostle visited the {{uninhabited}} <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), {{he put up}} a cross atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city.

5|$|The 1905 Tour de France was {{the third}} edition of the Tour de France, held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto.

The race saw the introduction of <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tour de France, and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|The South Hills {{crossbill}} is a finch {{endemic to}} the South Hills and Albion <b>Mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Minidoka District. It rarely interbreeds with similar crossbills that {{are present in}} its range, {{and it has been}} proposed as a separate species created via ecological speciation. The American Ornithologists' Union failed to find consensus on the issue so the South Hills crossbill is still considered a subspecies of the red crossbill.|$|E

5|$|These {{developments}} impelled the Krugers' {{return to}} the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that compelled Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father thereupon settled {{at the foot of}} the Magaliesberg <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal. In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as Dingaansdag ("Dingane's Day") or the Day of the Vow.|$|E

5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear {{patterns on the}} faces of the <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Although they appeared to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A dark band on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew.|$|E
5|$|Wolves were reintroduced {{into the}} Northern Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s. In February 2011, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{attached}} radio collars to several wolves in the Imnaha Pack in northeastern Oregon to allow study of their migration. The pack was Oregon's first since wolves {{returned to the}} state. The wolves were numbered; one of them, a year-old male from the pack's second litter, was given the code OR-7 as the seventh wolf to be collared.|$|E
5|$|All known Daspletosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in {{formations}} dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of Daspletosaurus, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E
