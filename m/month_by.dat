These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
