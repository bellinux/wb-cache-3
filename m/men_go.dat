Imran later reassures his friends that everything is okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three <b>men</b> <b>go</b> to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer their calls to bail them out, Imran reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imran, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E
500|$|Scott Wells, {{a racing}} correspondent, wrote in The Speedhorse Magazine that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> [...] "grew up lean and hard-boned, long-bodied and long-hipped, {{but not the}} best looking horse in the world. Not the best looking, just the best." [...] <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> had a {{reputation}} for being difficult to handle. His trainer once told Walt Wiggins, Sr. that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was [...] "jes plain mean as a bear most of the time". Throughout his racing career, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> stayed mean.

500|$|In 1955, when <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was a two-year-old, A.B. Green bragged that he {{intended}} to buy the horse from Ferguson. [...] Although Ferguson did not want to sell, he felt he had to at least set a price. [...] After hearing rumors that Green was prepared with a cashier's check for $40,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ), Ferguson set the price at $42,000 cash (approximately $ as of [...] ) and twenty-onebreedings to the stallion. To Ferguson's surprise, Green had that much cash available; Ferguson felt compelled to sell <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Two years later, at a Los Alamitos race meet, Green claimed that his newest horse, Double Bid, could outrace <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> This incensed Ferguson, who had just entered <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother Mr Mackay in a race with Double Bid. Ferguson bet Green $42,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ) against <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> that Mr Mackay would beat Double Bid in the upcoming race. Mr Mackay won the race, and Ferguson regained ownership of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Later in 1960, because he also owned <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother, father, and mother, he sold <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Frank Vessels Sr. and Bill and Harriet Peckham for $125,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ).

25|$|The Ottoman Empire invaded northwestern Persia in 1914. Before {{the end of}} 1914, Turkish and Kurdish {{troops had}} {{successfully}} entered the villages in and around Urmia. On February 21, 1915 the Turkish army in Urmia seized 61 leading Assyrians from the French missions as hostages, demanding large ransoms. The mission had enough money to convince the Ottomans to let 20 of the <b>men</b> <b>go.</b> However, on February 22 the remaining 41 were executed, having their heads cut off at the stairs of the Charbachsh Gate. The dead included bishop Mar Denkha.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor {{to see how she}} is doing. Pregnant women {{have to deal with the}} pregnancy with the help of other women while the <b>men</b> <b>go</b> along their day like nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E
25|$|Included as {{a special}} feature on the DVD is an {{animated}} comic that foreshadows {{the events of the}} next film. In the Zinco Epilogue, a group of <b>men</b> <b>go</b> into Rasputin's tomb and find Kroenen's body. After bringing Kroenen to a doctor along with instructions to revive him with an alchemical manual, Zinco and his party travel to an arctic cave with Zinco as the only survivor. Upon entering the cavern, Zinco opens a container he has with him containing the preserved head of Kroenen and attaches it to a giant robot. As soon as it is attached, the cyborg awakens and the spirit of Rasputin appears, stating that he has one more job for him.|$|E
5|$|Neither of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> parents raced. His sire (father), the Thoroughbred {{stallion}} Top Deck, was bred by the King Ranch. His dam (mother) {{hailed from}} Louisiana; <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> {{is thought to}} have gained his swiftness on the track from her. For the first years of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.|$|R

500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico.

25|$|Together, the two {{men began}} {{producing}} a huge body of short films, including The Battle of the Century, Should Married <b>Men</b> <b>Go</b> Home?, Two Tars, Be Big!, Big Business, and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short Unaccustomed As We Are in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature {{in one of the}} revue sequences of The Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in Technicolor) musical feature The Rogue Song. Their first starring feature Pardon Us was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler The Music Box, which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{instances of}} chicanery, {{the appeal of}} spiritualism was strong. Prominent {{in the ranks of}} its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families {{during the time of the}} American Civil War had seen their <b>men</b> <b>go</b> off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized s√©ances in the White House which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. The surge of spiritualism during this time, and later during World War I, was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands and Belgium, people {{annually}} celebrate St. Nicolas Eve with Sinterklaas {{accompanied by}} multiple Zwarte Pieten {{in the form}} of adolescent boys and girls, and men and women, who use blackface or now more often in large city parades in different colors and styles while wearing Moorish page boy costumes. The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back {{to the middle of the}} 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children's book author, added an African servant to the Sinterklaas story. However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with black faces appeared in Winter Solstice rituals. In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of companions of Saint Nicholas, who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Niklaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland. Also on Saint Martin's Eve, black-faced <b>men</b> <b>go</b> around in processions through W√∂rgl and the Lower Inn Valley, in Tyrol.|$|E

5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees‚Äîthe price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion‚ÄîGo <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|R

25|$|Freyr himself {{interrupts}} at this point, {{and says}} that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnar√∂k. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Ger√∞r with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnar√∂k. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, {{and says that}} Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when <b>men</b> <b>go</b> to battle.|$|E
25|$|The next {{operation}} for the regiment was in Normandy, France with the 6th Airborne Division. The 8th and 9th Battalions, {{along with the}} 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, from the (3rd Parachute Brigade) and the 7th, 12th and 13th Battalions of the (5th Parachute Brigade) were involved. The mission was Operation Tonga, capturing bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal, and destroying the Merville Gun Battery and several other bridges to prevent the Germans reaching the landing beaches. The 7th Battalion had so many missing that, by 03:00, only around 40 percent of the battalion had been accounted for. They did, however, manage to reinforce the glider troops of 2nd Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry from the 6th Airlanding Brigade that had captured the Caen and Orne bridges in Operation Deadstick and held them until relieved by the 3rd Infantry Division. The 12th and 13th Battalions also had about 40 percent of their <b>men</b> <b>go</b> missing. The 12th had to capture the village of Le Bas de Ranville, whilst the 13th {{was to take the}} town of Ranville. Both battalions then helped secure the area around the captured bridges until relieved. Only about 150 men of the 9th Battalion had assembled when they launched their assault on the Merville Gun Battery. Their attack on the battery was successful, but with heavy casualties: 50 dead and 25 wounded. The 8th Battalion had to destroy two bridges near Bures and a third by Troarn. All bridges were destroyed and the battalion numbering around 190 men dug in around Troarn. The paras held the left flank of the invasion area until going onto the offensive on the night of 16/17 August. In nine days, they advanced to the mouth of the River Seine, capturing over 1,000 German prisoners. On 27 August, the division was withdrawn from the front line and embarked for England in September. The division's casualties were 821 killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing.|$|E
500|$|Of the Central Atlas Tamazight {{speakers}}, 40‚Äì45% are monolingual, {{while the}} others use Arabic as a second language.

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{improved with}} the third episode; writing in New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised Episode 3 as being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce", and commented positively on Ripley's and Nesbitt's acting. Billen compared the production and fantasy scenes with Thirtysomething and Ally McBeal. In the Evening Standard, following the conclusion of Vanity Fair and prior to the broadcast of Episode 6, Billen wrote, [...] "The style is light, the narrative frequently inconsequential. The <b>men</b> <b>go</b> to the pub and lust after the barmaid. The women meet in the wine bar and make fun of the men for lusting after the barmaid. The great settings are DIY stores, antenatal classes and sitting rooms. Why should anyone be interested? If domestic trivia has now been outlawed by the BBC as a subject for sitcoms and if even soap operas rely on murders and armed sieges to keep up their figures, why should the travails {{of a set of}} ex-dinkies have become a minor cult?" [...] He analysed the series in relation to its early-middle-aged viewers being [...] "a forgotten people", comparing the storylines to real-life issues experienced by friends. He concluded: ...|$|E

Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay <b>men</b> <b>go</b> through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 30 September‚Äì1 October, seven units are sent to kidnap the generals {{associated}} with the Council. Nasution manages to escape over a wall, while his attach√© Pierre Tendean comes running out, wielding a gun; Tendean is quickly captured and, when asked where Nasution is, confesses himself to be the general. Yani, who fights back, is killed in his home; Major General M. T. Haryono meets a similar fate. Chief Military Prosecutor Sutoyo Siswomiharjo, Major General Siswondo Parman, and Lieutenant General Soeprapto are captured. Brigadier General D. I. Pandjaitan goes willingly, but when he prays for too long before entering the truck he is killed. The bodies and prisoners are taken to the G30S/PKI camp in Lubang Buaya, where the survivors are tortured and killed. Their bodies are then thrown into a well. Later that morning, members of the movement take over the RRI office and force the staff there to read a speech by Untung (Bram Adrianto), which states that the G30S has moved to forestall a coup by the Generals' Council and announces {{the formation of a}} [...] "Revolutionary Council". Other G30S/PKI <b>men</b> <b>go</b> to the palace to secure the president but find that he has already left. At Halim, the president speaks with the G30S leaders and declares that he will take full control of the Army. Another radio speech is soon read, outlining the composition of the new Revolutionary Council and announcing changes to Army hierarchy. The G30S leaders begin planning their escape from Halim, to be done before midnight.|$|E

500|$|Another {{anti-hunting}} demonstration {{becomes the}} film's focus, {{this time on}} the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of <b>men</b> <b>go</b> out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the [...] "Ceremony of Life", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna {{used to measure the}} winds of El Ni√±o for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey.|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{argued that}} though all of Austen's novels {{are set in}} provincial England, there {{is in fact a}} global {{component}} to her stories with the British Empire as a place where <b>men</b> <b>go</b> off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in Persuasion; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in Mansfield Park; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in Sense and Sensibility. Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793-98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a [...] "home". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the [...] "home" [...] that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could [...] "not" [...] write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the [...] "stories of empire" [...] are placed in a [...] "context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response".|$|E
