Manual methods also involve time constraints that place limitations on the number of data streams that can be incorporated into the forecast, which therefore limits forecasting accuracy.|$|E

These tools serve {{a wide range of}} business functions and applications. There exist limitations in effectively selecting the appropriate business process <b>modelling</b> <b>tool</b> relative to corporate functions and applications. This research explores this specific limitation and serves as a guide to mitigate this specific limitation relative to prioritizing and selecting a business process <b>modelling</b> <b>tool.</b> This investigation explores the limitations in the currently designed business process <b>modelling</b> <b>tool</b> based on local, regional and global modelling of corporate processes. Results prove essential prioritization constituents relative to selecting a more enhanced business process <b>modelling</b> <b>tool</b> for enterprise professionals. The applicability of the proposed prioritization approach is demonstrated...|$|R

The young man watched what she was doing earnestly enough for a few moments; then his attention wandered away to Nanina. She looked at him reproachfully, and he answered by a sign which brought a smile to her face directly. Maddalena surprised her at the instant of the change; and, following the direction of her eyes, easily discovered at whom the smile was directed. She darted a glance of contempt at Nanina, threw down the <b>modeling</b> <b>tool,</b> and turned indignantly to the young sculptor, who was affecting to be hard at work again.|$|E
60|$|Mechanically {{stirring}} the wet plaster {{round and round}} for the second casting, the priest looked into the glass, and saw, as in a picture, all that was going forward in the inner room. Maddalena Lomi was standing behind the young nobleman, watching the progress he made with his bust. Occasionally she took the <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> out of his hand, and showed him, with her sweetest smile, that she, too, as a sculptor's daughter, understood something of the sculptor's art; and now and then, in the pauses of the conversation, when her interest was especially intense in Fabio's work, she suffered her hand to drop absently on his shoulder, or stooped forward so close to him that her hair mingled for a moment with his. Moving the glass an inch or two, so as to bring Nanina well under his eye, Father Rocco found that he could trace each repetition of these little acts of familiarity by the immediate effect which they produced on the girl's face and manner. Whenever Maddalena so much as touched the young nobleman--no matter whether she did so by premeditation, or really by accident--Nanina's features contracted, her pale cheeks grew paler, she fidgeted on her chair, and her fingers nervously twisted and untwisted the loose ends of the ribbon fastened round her waist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Due to the {{increasing}} number of Information Communication Technology (ICT) environments, security is becoming a concern for many researchers and organisations. Organisations have implemented different security measures to protect their assets. Different industries—such as power plants and water, oil, and gas utilities—are adapting different network <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> for guarding their assets and are preparing for incidents that might occur in the future. <b>Modelling</b> <b>tools</b> are very important for the visualisation of computer networks. There are currently many <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> with different <b>modelling</b> and visualisation capabilities for computer networks. The aim of this research is to make a thorough assessment of the different modelling tools’ capabilities of modelling computer networks and visualising computer network communication. Furthermore, it hopes to show areas for improvement in order to increase the quality of <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> based on industry requirements. The research methodology of this research {{takes the form of a}} case study. First, the study analyses previous research in order to illustrate gaps in the literature, as well as identifying the strengths and weaknesses of existing network <b>modelling</b> <b>tools.</b> The empirical part of the research includes first, studying and evaluating seven open-source <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> based on different types of capabilities, this may limit the generalisability of the findings to some extent; and second, selecting four <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> for further study. Once four <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> were evaluated based on literature reviews and the requirements set in this study, the top two open-source (OSS) <b>modelling</b> <b>tool</b> packages were selected, downloaded, installed, and evaluated further. The criteria set to evaluate the four <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> in this research are based on the requirements provided by the European company nSense, which provides different vulnerability assessments, security consulting, and training, and the existing literature. The evaluation of the tools resulted in the screens that were copied and presented in this document for verification. Finally, the one tool which was the most suitable for further studies, and which fulfilled most of the requirements set in this research, was recommended for further research. In total, four <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> were chosen for the evaluation, using different literature reviews based on the requirements (see Appendix A) in this research. The results showed that the two top <b>modelling</b> <b>tools</b> were OMNeT++ and IMUNES. After practical analysis of these tools, OMNeT++ was found to be the best tool based on the aims and requirements of this research. Further, the study found that usability problems played a large part in evaluating different <b>modelling</b> <b>tools,</b> which might have changed the outcomes of the result. It can therefore be concluded that this type of evaluation is highly dependent on the evaluator’s knowledge and skill, as well as the usability of the tool...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{formulate}} a technically sound approach to designing Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital filters using high-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools.</b> High-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> provide the ability to build and simulate ideal models. Once proper validation is complete on these ideal models, the user can then migrate to lower levels of abstraction until an actual real world model is designed. High-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> are the epitome of the top-down design concept in which design first takes place with the basic functional knowledge of a system. With each level of abstraction, validation is performed. High-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> are used throughout industry and their application is continually growing especially in the DSP area where many modes of communications are expanding. High-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> and validation significantly address this complex expansion by utilizing an ideal representation of a complicated network. iii TABLE OF CONTENTS Abstract [...] . ii Table of Contents [...] iii Chapter 1...|$|R
