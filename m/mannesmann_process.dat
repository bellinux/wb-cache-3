40|$|One of the {{challenging}} objectives {{in studying the}} <b>Mannesmann</b> piercing <b>process</b> is to predict the fracture initiation, known as "Mannesmann effect", in order to design and optimize the working parameters of the piercing process. The objective of the paper is to investigate the workability of a tube steel tested in the same conditions of the Mannesman piercing process. The stress and strain {{states as well as}} temperature fields arising during the process are identified through numerical simulations. The hot tensile test is chosen for fundamental studies on fracture initiation, as a tensile state of stress in the centre of the billet in the first stages of the piercing process before the plug arrival seems {{to be one of the}} main causes of the crack initiation. The material constants of energy-based models implemented in FEM codes are calculated and numerical results are compared with non-plug piercing tests carried out on the industrial plant...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mannesmann</b> {{piercing}} <b>process</b> is {{a well-known}} hot rolling process used for seamless tube production. Its special feature is the so-called Mannesmann effect, that is the cavity formation {{in the center of}} the cylindrical billet and its propagation along the axis due to stress state caused by the rolls in the early stages of the process. The cavity is then expanded and sized in its internal diameter by an incoming plug. The industrial requirement is to know quite precisely the characteristics of the cavity especially in terms of its location along the billet axis in order to minimize the plug wear and the oxidation of the pierced bar. However, the scientific knowledge about the fracture mechanism leading to the Mannesmann effect is still limited, even if several theories have been proposed; this lack makes the design and optimization of the process through numerical simulations still a challenging task. The aim of this work is then to develop a suitably calibrated FE model of the piercing process in its first stage before the plug arrival, in order to investigate the Mannesmann effect using different damage criteria. Hot tensile tests, capable to reproduce the industrial conditions in terms of temperature, strain rate, and stress states, are carried out to investigate the material workability and to determine the parameters of the damage models on specimens machined from continuous-casting steel billets. The calculated parameters are implemented in the numerical model of the process and a sensitivity analysis to the different criteria is carried out, comparing numerical results with non-plug piercing tests conducted in the industrial plant...|$|R

50|$|In 1886, the German {{brothers}} Reinhard (1856-1922) and Max Mannesmann (1857-1915) {{received the}} world's first patent for their invention {{of a process}} for rolling seamless steel pipes (<b>Mannesmann</b> <b>process).</b> Between 1887 and 1889 they founded tube mills with several different business partners in Bous, Germany, in Komotau/Bohemia, in Landore/Wales and in their home town Remscheid/Germany. In 1890, due to technical and financial start-up problems, the tube and pipe mills existing on the continent were folded into Deutsch-Österreichische Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG. The new company had its headquarters in Berlin. Reinhard and Max Mannesmann formed the first board of directors but left it in 1893. In that year the company headquarters were moved to Düsseldorf - {{at that time the}} center of the German tube and pipe industry. The company was renamed Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG in 1908.|$|E
