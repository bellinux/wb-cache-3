There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

500|$|This final stanza {{lost its}} {{significance}} with {{the completion of}} the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed for a sense of anticipation at the poem's close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining [...] "Lucy poems". Of the other changes, only the description of the horse's movement is important: [...] "My horse trudg'd on" [...] becomes [...] "With quickening pace <b>my</b> <b>horse</b> drew nigh", which heightens the narrator's vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.|$|E

[...] Donald Brumfield, Our Native's jockey said Twice a Prince kicked Our Native in the hoof and body while rearing in the starting gate.

500|$|On race day, California Chrome made a clean start, {{was close}} to the front through the backstretch, made his bid for the lead at the far turn, and was first by the top of the stretch. The second-place {{finisher}} was Ride on Curlin, who made a strong move late in the race to finish [...] lengths behind California Chrome. Both held off a challenge from Social Inclusion, who tired and finished third. General a Rod was fourth. The winning time was 1:54:84, earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 105. Social Inclusion's owner, Ron Sanchez, said, [...] "He's the real deal... <b>My</b> <b>horse</b> came to challenge him, but he found another engine. He was gone." [...] Espinoza's ride was described as [...] "flawless", and the press noted the special affinity between the horse and jockey.|$|E
500|$|In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, {{but then}} made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a {{photographer}} for the Daily Racing Form, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later {{used as the basis}} for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: [...] "I let <b>my</b> <b>horse</b> drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them." [...] Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with [...] furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by [...] lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.|$|E
500|$|Bystanders rushed {{onto the}} track and {{attempted}} to aid Davison and Jones until both {{were taken to the}} nearby Epsom Cottage Hospital. She was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail. She died on 8 June, from a fracture at the base of her skull. Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and Queen Mary were present at the race and made enquiries about the health of both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was [...] "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a [...] "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of the fourth in London, before returning home the following day. He could recall little of the event: [...] "She seemed to clutch at <b>my</b> <b>horse,</b> and I felt it strike her." [...] He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later.|$|E

500|$|Some Kentucky {{citizens}} were already displeased with {{parts of the}} state's constitution, and the disputed gubernatorial election of 1796 had added to the enthusiasm of those calling for a constitutional convention to revise it. Breckinridge opposed such a call, fearing changes would imperil his wealth and power. John Breckinridge asked, [...] "Where is the difference whether I am robbed of <b>my</b> <b>horse</b> by a highway-man, or of my slave {{by a set of}} people called a Convention? … If they can by one experiment emancipate our slaves; the same principle pursued, will enable them at a second experiment to extinguish our land titles; both are held by rights equally sound." [...] The desire for a convention was so strong, even in aristocratic Fayette County, that Breckinridge's position nearly cost him his seat in the legislature. Seeking election to a full term in May 1798, he was the seventh-highest vote-getter, securing the last of Fayette County's seats in the legislature by only eight votes. Despite the efforts of conservatives like Breckinridge and George Nicholas, in late 1798, the General Assembly called a convention for July 22, 1799. Delegates to the convention were to be elected in May 1799, and the conservatives immediately began organizing slates of candidates that would represent their interests. Popular because of his role in securing adoption of the Kentucky Resolutions, Breckinridge was among the six conservative candidates promoted in Fayette County, all of whom were elected. Out of the fifty-eight men who arrived in Frankfort in late July as convention delegates, fifty-seven owned slaves and fifty held substantial property. Between the election and the convention, Breckinridge and Judge Caleb Wallace worked with Nicholas (who did not seek election as a delegate) to draft resolutions that Breckinridge would introduce at the convention in an attempt to steer the proceedings toward conservative positions.|$|E

I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought <b>my</b> <b>horse</b> was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon <b>my</b> <b>horse,</b> and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.|$|E

The Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot, and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who said, “It has done its last for me — I am paying the matured bills of penalty.” ...|$|E
