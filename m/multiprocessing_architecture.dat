40|$|<b>Multiprocessing</b> <b>architectures</b> provide {{hardware}} for executing multiple tasks simultaneously via {{techniques such}} as simultaneous multithreading and symmetric multiprocessing. The problem addressed by this paper is that even when tasks that are executing concurrently do not communicate, they may interfere by affecting each other’s timing. For cyberphysical system applications, such interference can nullify many of the advantages offered by parallel hardware. In this paper, we argue for temporal semantics in layers of abstraction in computing. This {{will enable us to}} achieve temporal isolation on <b>multiprocessing</b> <b>architectures.</b> We discuss techniques at the microarchitecture level, in the memory hierarchy, in on-chip communication, and in the instruction-set architecture that can provide temporal semantics and control over timing.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a generalized parallelization methodology for mapping video coding algorithms onto a <b>multiprocessing</b> <b>architecture,</b> through systematic task decomposition, scheduling and performance analysis. It exploits data parallelism {{inherent in the}} coding process and performs task scheduling base on task data size and access locality with the aim to hide as much communication overhead as possible. Utilizing Petri-nets and task graphs for representation and analysis, the method enables parallel video frame capturing, buffering and encoding without extra communication overhead. The theoretical speedup analysis indicates that this method offers excellent communication hiding, resulting in system efficiency well above 90 %. A H. 261 video encoder has been implemented on a TMS 32 OC 8 O system using this method, and its performance was measured. The theoretical and measured performances are similar in that the measured speedup of the H. 261 is 3. 67 and 3. 76 on four PP for QCIF and 352 x 240 video, respectively. They correspond to frame rates of 30. 7 frame per second (fps) and 9. 25 fps, and system efficiency of 91. 8 % and 94 % respectively.
