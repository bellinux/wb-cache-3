500|$|Reviewing the Steph-centric {{spin-off}} In Too Deep for The Times, Tim Teeman {{commented that}} while late-night Hollyoaks episodes {{had previously been}} amusing, [...] "sexed-up" [...] versions of the main show, with In Too Deep it became [...] "less shagathon, <b>more</b> <b>What</b> Lies Beneath". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by Laws of the Sunday Mercury. The launch of Hollyoaks Later series one, in which Niall returns to target Steph, was named a [...] "Satellite Pick of the Day" [...] by the Daily Record. Christopher Howse, writing [...] "Tatworld" [...] for The Daily Telegraph—a column chronicling tabloid culture—named Steph and her family joint tenth in a list of Top Ten Deans, which included entrants such as Dean Koontz, Dean Gaffney and Richard Dean Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Liam Neeson reprises {{his role}} as the voice of the lion Aslan. Aslan is [...] "more parental here, [...] lets the kids, well, make their own mistakes". Aslan's {{entrance}} was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature, and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil. Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis' version of Jesus, Neeson [...] "see him more as the spirit of the planet – this living, breathing planet. That's what he stands for, for me; <b>more</b> <b>what</b> the native Americans would believe." [...] As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film, the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly. His pose had to be regal, but if he moved his head too much, he would remind viewers of a dog. As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent, Aslan's eyes were also changed to look less [...] "Egyptian". Many of his shots were finished at the last minute.|$|E

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her <b>more.</b> <b>What</b> Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} Innerspace writer Jeffrey Boam {{perform the}} next rewrite. Boam {{spent two weeks}} reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film. Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father {{in the middle of}} the story. [...] "Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended," [...] he said, [...] "So I thought, let them lose the Grail, and let the father–son relationship be the main point. It's an archaeological search for Indy's own identity and coming to accept his father is <b>more</b> <b>what</b> it's about [...]" [...] Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films. In Boam's first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail.|$|E

And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American."

2500|$|The eighth track, [...] "Angel", was {{inspired}} by R music and was composed around a series of piano loops. [...] "When You Know You Know" [...] features an orchestra and its lyrics discuss a failing relationship. The tenth track, [...] "(No <b>More)</b> <b>What</b> Ifs", features a rap by Eve and received negative reviews, with The Guardian describing it as [...] "an ill-advised move for all concerned". [...] "Not Givin' Up", features a heavy urban beat with electronic sound effects in the background. The song was well received by critics because of its [...] "near-certain crossover appeal for {{both sides of the}} Atlantic". [...] "Still Here", the twelfth track, was originally recorded for the film Rocky Balboa in 2006, but was not included on the soundtrack. The song was later covered by Jennifer Hudson and included on her 2010 second album, I Remember Me.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1890s, Remington took {{frequent}} trips {{around the}} U.S., Mexico, and abroad to gather ideas for articles and illustrations, but his military and cowboy subjects always sold the best, {{even as the}} Old West was playing out. In 1892, he painted [...] "A Cavalryman's Breakfast on the Plains". Gradually, he transitioned from the premiere chronicler-artist of the Old West to its most important historian-artist. He formed an effective partnership with Owen Wister, who became the leading writer of Western stories at the time. Having more confidence of his craft, Remington wrote, [...] "My drawing is done entirely from memory. I never use a camera now. The interesting never occurs in nature as a whole, but in pieces. It's <b>more</b> <b>what</b> I leave out than what I add." [...] Remington's focus continued on outdoor action and he rarely depicted scenes in gambling and dance halls typically seen in Western movies. He avoided frontier women as well. His painting A Misdeal (1897) is a rare instance of indoor cowboy violence.|$|E

2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was <b>more</b> <b>what</b> I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Nancy's {{becoming}} pregnant, All About Soaps Claire Crick {{said that}} it was good news as [...] "Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents [...] They might be poles apart in personalities, but it seems {{that when it comes to}} Mr and Mrs Osborne, opposites really do attract – and we couldn’t love these two <b>more.</b> <b>What</b> with Darren’s cheeky escapades and Nancy’s no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents". She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We’re hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a stress-free pregnancy, but we don’t fancy their chances". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare". Morgan added that [...] "Despite the sad nature of the storyline, it’s been amazing (as always) to watch Jess Fox (aka Nancy) and Ashley Taylor Dawson (Darren) acting their socks off, and proving to us once again they’re two of the best actors in soap right now".|$|E
2500|$|Phrases such as [...] "It is vain {{to do with}} <b>more</b> <b>what</b> can be {{done with}} fewer" [...] and [...] "A {{plurality}} is not to be posited without necessity" [...] were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic writing. Robert Grosseteste, in Commentary on [...] the Posterior Analytics Books (Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros) (c. 1217–1220), declares: [...] "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal." [...] The Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) states that [...] "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many". Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to God's existence, an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. quinque viae), and specifically, through an argument based on causality. Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also Correlation does not imply causation).|$|E

2500|$|Allegedly in {{connection}} with the Lycurgan Reforms (e.g. in the mid-8th Century BC), property had been divided into 9,000 equal portions as part of a massive land reform. Each citizen received one estate, a kleros, and thereafter was expected to derive his wealth from it. The land itself was worked by helots, who retained half the yield. From the other half, the Spartiate was expected to pay his mess (syssitia) fees, and the agoge fees for his children. However, we know nothing about whether land could be bought and sold, whether it could be inherited, if so by what system (primogeniture or equally divided among heirs), whether daughters received dowries and much <b>more.</b> <b>What</b> is clear is that from early on there were marked differences of wealth within the state, and these became even more serious after the law of Epitadeus, passed at some time after the Peloponnesian War, removed the legal prohibition of the gift or bequest of land. By the mid-5th century, land had become concentrated {{in the hands of a}} tiny elite, and the notion of all Spartan citizens being [...] "equals" [...] had become a farce. By Aristotle's day (384–322 BC) citizenship had been reduced from 9,000 to less than 1,000, and then further decreased to 700 at the accession of Agis IV in 244 BC. Attempts were made to remedy this situation by creating new laws. Certain penalties were imposed upon those who remained unmarried or who married too late in life. These laws, however, came too late and were ineffective in reversing the trend.|$|E
