500|$|The Hot Rock is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed third album Dig Me Out, released in 1997by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars. After {{the success of}} Dig <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>and</b> its predecessor Call the Doctor, several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts, but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars. As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls, [...] "We want to project the image that we're successful". Co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein added, [...] "And we're proud that we've {{been able to do}} that from a tiny label [...] We've been able to do it non-traditionally, and hopefully that's inspiring and encouraging to people".|$|E
500|$|The women held a vote as {{to whether}} Balukas {{should be allowed to}} play. She later {{explained}} that [...] "what hurt at Binghamton was that while I was trying to stand up for us being treated the same as men, the other girls held the tournament draw without me. By one vote, they kept <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>And</b> some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me." [...] She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place. Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E

2500|$|Isis {{were the}} opening act for Tool's late 2006 North American tour {{in support of}} their new album, 10,000 Days. This led to {{increased}} exposure for the band; however, the band members are not particularly comfortable with fame, and tend to keep their affairs private. Turner has stated that [...] "We never imagined that Isis would become as successful or as popular as it has", and confesses: [...] " [...] taking a deeply personal interest in who I am, it fucking freaks <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>And</b> I really do feel like sometimes when I get approached, I'm retreating into my shell." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{role in the}} {{censorship}} process reportedly earned Georgescu personally {{the hostility}} of poet Ion Barbu, a modernist from Lovinescu's circle, whose political opinions and artistic tenets had made him virtually unpublishable. According to Valeriu Râpeanu, Barbu {{came up to the}} critic in Bucharest's Casa Capşa restaurant, and defiantly questioned the logic and effectiveness of censorship. Barbu's argument compared the regime with parents who fuss over the possibility of their child masturbating to the point where that child becomes determined to try it, and concluding: [...] "That's what you communists are doing, by always telling poets not to imitate Ion Barbu, [...] 'don't follow up on Ion Barbu's poetry, be very careful because it's decadent poetry'. They will start to seek <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> read me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, he {{returned}} to Los Angeles to record Loup Garou, again with producer John Philip Shenale. Musician said about the album: [...] "Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often {{within the framework of}} a single song... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check <b>me</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So I flew to Nashville ... That's got to go down in my book {{as one of the most}} memorable experiences in my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , and it made me sick. It really grossed <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I remember people got up and left, walked out of the theatre and I was just thinking, 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.' It was just too much I thought. And when the film came out, it wasn't in the film." ...|$|E

It is law, and as law it will be found in the {{criminal}} statutes.|$|E
