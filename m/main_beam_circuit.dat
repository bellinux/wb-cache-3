Against {{the problem}} of the {{aerodynamic}} interference effects on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous rigid frame bridges with high-pier and long-span, the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> in the parallel long-span continuous rigid frame bridges were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test. The space between the two <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> and wind attack angles were changed during the wind tunnel test to study the effects on aerodynamic interferences of aerostatic coefficients of <b>main</b> <b>beam.</b> The test got aerostatic coefficients of 10 conditions. The research results have shown that the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> in parallel bridges can not be ignored. The aerodynamic interference effects on parallel bridge <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> upstream changed but not change significantly.

40|$|High flexural-rigid {{cross beams}} {{at the joints}} of a <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> can {{function}} as restraining members to prevent rotation during lateral torsional buckling (LTB). With less flexural-rigid members, joint rotation results in a decrease of the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> LTB critical moment. This paper elucidates the cross beam’s minimum flexural rigidity to prevent the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> joint rotation during torsional buckling. It is assumed that material behaves elastically, the beam’s web doesn’t undergo distortions, and shear forces effects are neglected. The cross-beam’s flexural rigidity is represented by a spiral spring. Under buckling, this spring produces a torque moment, proportional to the joint rotation. The torque will disturb the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> LTB equation system. By adjusting the spring constant, the joint rotation is minimized, thus reducing the torque’s disturbing effect within the equation. By neglecting this effect, the LTB equations at all fields of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> are identical to the general buckling equations for constant moments. For n cross beams, 4 (n+ 1) integration constants are resulted. By applying the boundary conditions at beam ends and utilizing the geometry and natural boundary conditions at the joints, 4 (n+ 1) homogeneous equations for the integration constant are obtained. By conducting the trial and error method, the critical moment resulting in a zero determinant for the homogeneous equation coefficient matrix is acquired. Then, the LTB first-mode deformation shape can be drawn. The analysis shows that to achieve the critical moment, a <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> having a cross beam located at mid span needs the most optimum (smallest) flexural rigidity of cross beam than when it is in other locations (L/ 2).
