50|$|After Salvadori, most taxonomists, such as Dean Amadon and Ernst Mayr, {{considered}} it a subspecies of the mallard. Yoshimaro Yamashina examined those specimens in Japanese museums in 1948, and decided that the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> {{was an example of}} hybrid speciation, and was descended from the mallard and the Pacific black duck's Palau subspecies (Anas superciliosa pelewensis). However, no molecular genetic evidence is available to support this hypothesis. Some scientists, such as Jean Delacour, have considered the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> a simple hybrid, so it was absent from Delacour's four-volume monograph on the ducks and from the IUCN Red List. If Yamashina's hypothesis is correct, the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> would have presumably evolved into near species status in only about ten thousand years.|$|R
50|$|Neither <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallards</b> nor their {{progenitor}} {{species are}} known from fossils on the Marianas, casting into doubt {{the assumption that}} a resident black duck population had been long established on the islands. However, most rock shelters and caves on the Marianas were obliterated in the 1944 Battle of Guam. A species of flightless duck is known from a prehistoric bone found on Rota in 1994; was apparently not {{closely related to the}} <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Feeding and {{reproduction}} {{are not well}} documented, but cannot expected to differ significantly from its immediate relatives. The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> fed on aquatic invertebrates, small vertebrates and plants, and although they were not observed up-ending like mallards, they probably did so.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mariana</b> <b>mallards</b> were 51 - 56 cm {{long and}} weighed {{approximately}} 1 kg, making them marginally smaller than mallards. Two intergrading color morphs {{were found in}} males, called the [...] "platyrhynchos" [...] and the [...] "superciliosa" [...] type after the species they resembled more.|$|R
5|$|The Eastern or Chinese spot-billed duck is {{currently}} introgressing into the mallard {{populations of the}} Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming. The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> was a resident allopatric populationin most respects a good speciesapparently initially derived from mallard-Pacific black duck hybrids; unfortunately, it became extinct in the late 20thcentury.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> or Oustalet's duck (Anas oustaleti) is an extinct type of duck of {{the genus}} Anas that was endemic to the Mariana Islands. Its taxonomic status is debated, and it has {{variously}} been treated as a full species, a subspecies of the mallard or the Pacific black duck, or sometimes as a subspecies of the Indian spot-billed duck.|$|R
50|$|Hybridization {{between two}} {{different}} species sometimes {{leads to a}} distinct phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if reproductive isolation is achieved, it {{may lead to a}} separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid speciation is considered an extremely rare event. The <b>mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> is thought to have arisen from hybrid speciation.|$|R
50|$|The Lonicera fly, {{a hybrid}} in the genus Rhagoletis, is a North American fruit fly {{of the family}} Tephritidae. Its larvae feed on the berries of species of {{introduced}} honeysuckle (Lonicera) that were brought to America within the last 250 years as ornamental plants. A research team led by Dietmar Schwarz has argued that it most likely developed within that time by hybridization of two other species: R. mendax, the blueberry maggot, and R. zephyria, the snowberry maggot. Few cases of animal species arising from hybridization are known (see pomarine jaeger or <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard),</b> although with DNA analysis more are being found.|$|R
50|$|It has a dark body, and a paler {{head with}} a dark crown and facial stripes. In flight, it shows a green {{speculum}} and pale underwing. All plumages are similar. The size range is 54-61 cm; males tend to be larger than females, and some island forms are smaller and darker than the main populations. It is not resident on the Marianas islands, but sometimes occurs there during migration. The now extinct <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> was probably originally derived from hybrids between this species and the mallard, which came to the islands during migration and settled down there.|$|R
5000|$|The taxonomic {{status of}} the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> is disputed, since it resembles an {{intermediate}} of the mallard and the Pacific black duck, two closely related allopatric species which frequently hybridise. Its males had two intergrading color morphs, called the [...] "platyrhynchos" [...] and the [...] "superciliosa" [...] types after the species they resembled more. It was first scientifically described by Tommaso Salvadori as full species in the genus Anas, named after its collector, the French zoologist Emile Oustalet. Salvadori suggested it {{was related to the}} Pacific black duck. It was previously known to the Chamorro people, who called it ngånga' (palao) in Chamorro, and to the Carolinian people, who called it ghereel'bwel in Carolinian.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> {{inhabited}} wetlands, mostly inland {{but occasionally}} also in coastal areas. On Guam, {{it was most}} abundant in the Talofofo River valley, on Tinian on Lake Hagoi and Lake Makpo (before it was drained and known as Makpo Swamp), and on Saipan on the Garpan Lagoon and on and around Lake Susupe. The birds were rather reclusive, preferring sheltered habitat with plenty of wetland and water plants - fern thickets (Acrostichum aureum) and reed beds (Scirpus, Cyperus and Phragmites), where they also nested. Usually, pairs or small flocks were encountered, but in the key habitats larger groups of dozens and rarely up to 50-60 individuals could be found. Apart from possible inter-island movement, the birds were not migratory.|$|R
50|$|The birds {{declined}} due to draining {{of wetlands}} for agriculture and construction. Hunting pressure was probably heavy, despite {{a ban on}} gun ownership under Japanese control (1914-1945), as the birds were unwary to traps, and at any rate the gun ban was lifted after World War II. By the 1940s, flocks {{of more than a}} dozen birds were seldom seen. On Guam, the last sightings were in 1949 and 1967—the latter being a single, possibly vagrant, bird—and on Tinian in 1974. As Lake Susupe offered the most plentiful and least accessible habitat, although it too suffered from pollution by sugar mill wastes, the Saipan population lingered on for a few more years. The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> was listed as federally endangered on June 2, 1977. In 1979, two males and a female were found on Saipan and caught; one male was later released, the last wild bird ever to be encountered. The pair was brought to Pohakuloa Training Area, Hawaii, and later to SeaWorld San Diego, where it was attempted to have them reproduce in captivity. However, this was unsuccessful and the species became extinct with the death of the last individual in 1981. Surveys were conducted in the following years, but the species was certainly gone by then. It was removed from the USFWS Endangered Species List on February 23, 2004, due to extinction.|$|R
