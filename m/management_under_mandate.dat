40|$|Available only in Spanish) This work {{attempts}} to extract {{lessons from the}} experience of the pension system reforms carried out in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. These reforms have introduced pensions based on individual funding, with private <b>management</b> <b>under</b> <b>mandate,</b> state regulation and guarantees, inspired by the Chilean reform. Given the excellent international availability of studies of the Chilean experience, this work concentrates on questions related to the design and implementation of new reforms. A word of caution is needed about the difficulties and limitations of comparing real well-established developments with incipient schemes, most of them barely expressed in regulations: legislation is frequently passed which is not followed through; and regulations sometimes represent ambiguous commitments not interpreted until later, and generate incentives that have met with diverse and variable responses over time. ...|$|E

For federally recognized Native American communities, government-to-government co-management {{relationships with the}} U. S. federal government have provided opportunities to modernize the treaty trust relationship, and enrich linkages between environmental ethics and cultural heritage, building tribal capacity and autonomy. The case of the Elwha River dam removal and ecosystem restoration on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State presents an opportunity to demonstrate the progress made in consultation practices and co-management efforts on the behalf of the U. S. government, in {{the execution of the}} largest dam removal project ever attempted. For the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, river restoration will re-connect the Tribe to the legendary salmon runs that are its cultural livelihood. The co-management relationship established between the project's two lead actors, the National Park Service and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, has demonstrated the positive outcomes of a mutually respected process facilitated through power-sharing, as well as the dilemma for tribal decision-makers in maintaining cultural tradition and engaging in environmental <b>management</b> <b>under</b> congressional <b>mandates...</b>|$|R

The {{evolution}} in the meaning of the term reflects larger shifts in the role of legislation in public resource management. The article illustrates this with an analysis of the 1997 Refuge Improvement Act, a substantial revision of the charter for the Refuge System and the first major statute governing public land management enacted since the 1970 s. The Refuge System 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 dominant use 2 ̆ 2 regime is an important model for sustainable resource management. The article describes this regime {{in the context of the}} unique purpose, hierarchy of dominant uses, and substantive <b>management</b> <b>mandates</b> <b>under</b> which the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service administers the national wildlife refuges. In addition, the article provides a critique of the planning, compatibility, and biological integrity, diversity and environmental health policies that the Service has promulgated to guide management of the refuges...|$|R
