40|$|Abstract: Coping {{with the}} initial and finest systems ’ {{functionality}} and performance is indeed {{one of the major}} problems nowadays, due to the rapid increase and continuous change of customer demands. Hence, it is crucial to move on with a research analysis in an attempt to identify whether documentation, the most reliable source for preserving a software system’s quality over the years, is properly created, updated and used in Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) operating in small EU markets, focusing both on the development process and the maintenance activities. Henceforth, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a <b>minimum</b> <b>documentation</b> set required to fulfil both the Software Engineering principles and the SME practical needs by comparing literature suggestions with empirical findings. In further support of our documentation set suggestion, we present and discuss the results of a small survey conducted in nine IT-oriented SME in Cyprus and Greece. ...|$|E

This practice is being {{carried out in the}} company Novacomp S. A. in the project: Management of the “Capability Maturity Model Integration” (CMMI) level 3 and ISO 25001. There is a need identified during this process, to systematize the management of projects, enabling a model that enables, executes, and delivers tangible results in established time periods. This study parts from the best practices for project management to identify known methodologies for such, and wraps up with workflows, templates and tools that allow for the execution of continuous improvement projects. During the first stage of the project, the organization’s current situation and gap analysis was performed, measuring against the CMMI maturity model. In brief, it was determined an execution urgency derived in project’s documentation and planning misses. This reinforced negatively on process gaps, lack of objective estimations including risk assessments, failures in scope definition and quality assurance, among others. The proposed solution contains a new work structure, focused in efficiency and effectiveness. It includes a new workflow to initiate, plan, execute, monitor, control and close continuous improvement projects.

It was originated as to propose a methodology for the management of continuous improvement projects, and thus as {{a solution to the problem}} of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the aforementioned. There is a need to systematize the management of such type of projects, enabling a model that pragmatically enables, executes, and delivers tangible results in less than twelve months. This study parts from a baseline of best practices for project management, then moves to identifying known methodologies for such, and wraps up with workflows, templates and tools that allow for the execution of continuous improvement projects. While determining such baseline, the Backup and Recovery’s sub-department’s current situation and gap analysis was performed, measuring against the CMMI maturity model. In brief, it was determined that the department´s execution urgency derived in projects´ documentation and planning misses. This reinforced negatively on process gaps, lack of objective estimations including risk assessments, failures in scope definition and quality assurance, among others. All the above was later synthesized in an S. W. O. T analysis, singling out the required elements in the proposed solution.

30|$|More in {{particular}} not only traditional and agile software development processes are blended, but also elements from them, especially artefacts. We define an artefact, {{in line with}} previous research, as a tangible deliverable produced during software development, including materials in both physical and electronic format (Wagenaar et al. 2015). This definition certainly includes physical artefacts, such as story cards and the Wall (Sharp et al. 2009), but allows in fact for a much broader spectre of artefacts. We join (Sharp et al. 2009) in their description {{of the connection between}} documentation and artefacts in ASD as “Documentation is kept to a minimum, in favour of close collaboration, and simple artefacts”. This definition equates (<b>minimum)</b> <b>documentation</b> and simple artefacts, opposing the both to the comprehensive documentation of the Agile Manifesto. Following this observation we prefer using the term ‘artefacts’ in the remainder of this article; this also allows us to overcome the perceived ravine between agile and old-fashioned documentation.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{software}} development has expanded into almost every sector of business and technology. Currently, Agile software development methods are much preferred over traditional software development methods which rely on heavy documentation. Agile methodologies such as Scrum (the focus of the study) rely on minimal documentation. However, software development organizations who seek accreditation against an internationally recognized quality management system (QMS) standard such as ISO 9001 : 2008 need to maintain {{a certain level of}} documentation to meet the requirements stipulated in the QMS standard. This study was undertaken to answer the following overall research question, in relation to healthcare software development: what would be the <b>minimum</b> level of <b>documentation</b> that would be acceptable for a Health-IT organization pursuing Scrum, if they are to maintain an internationally recognized QMS standard such as ISO 9001 : 2008 ? This overarching research question was first investigated through in-depth literature synthesis and subsequently discussed with a panel of experts. An iterative research design utilizing Delphi-like problem solving method was used to gather insights from Scrum practitioners. The study identified 23 documents to have varying levels of usefulness and importance to three categories of Scrum users, specifically Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. The study further identified the level of conciseness required in each document (to suit each category of Scrum users) and the stage in which each document should be prepared to add maximum value in using documentation. The study identified seven negative experiences Scrum practitioners come across: documents being difficult to understand by nontechnical customers; purpose of documents not being explicit; no follow-up with client’s feedback; excessive re-work on documents; deficiencies in document validation; lack of risk analysis reports and disruptions in software development. The study also identified seven problems practitioners face in creating important documents: lack of skilled document writers; last minute/hasty document preparation; misunderstanding the purpose/intent of Agile; lack of a common documentation standard; perceiving document creation as a burden; poor tooling for documentation and lack of right staff. It is expected that the study would benefit both the academia and the practitioner in gaining greater insights on the issue of documentation in Scrum...|$|R

30|$|Within this framework, the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA 2014), {{developed}} by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission and DG Environment, represents the reference point for data and methods that are essential to implementing life-cycle-based approaches. While the information contained within the EPLCA relates mainly to the EU, it is extending its reach to the global level (several international contributors have already joined, and others are about to join). The Platform promotes the availability of data and information, {{with a focus on}} coherence and quality assurance. Although the methodology is developing at a fast pace, particularly with regard to the requirements of the European Commission, the lack of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represents a major challenge to the mainstream use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in the business and policy sectors. Since its first release in 2006, the European Life Cycle Database (ELCD, developed under the EPLCA framework and managed by the JRC) gathers life cycle inventory (LCI) data from EU business associations (members of the advisory group of the EPLCA) and other sources for information on key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management. Most of the respective datasets are officially provided and approved by the industry associations involved. Many datasets have been revised and reviewed against the ILCD’s Entry-Level Requirements (European Commission JRC, Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2010 a)), and others are currently under review. This enabled the ELCD 3.0 (ELCD 2014) database (launched in 2013) {{to become one of the}} first nodes of the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN 2014; Recchioni et al. 2014), which was officially launched in February 2014. The datasets were reviewed against the ILCD Entry-Level Requirements in order to provide users with useful information on data quality, including <b>minimum</b> <b>documentation</b> and methodological consistency across datasets, and to ensure the availability of reliable data to be used in LCA studies. In a spirit of continuous improvement, the JRC will carry out a background analysis of key (energy) datasets of the ELCD in order to identify opportunities for improving the quality of the data. This paper describes the methodological approach that was used to carry out the analysis of the data quality of the energy datasets included in the current version of the ELCD. This method does not aim to compare the overall quality of existing databases, but to point out the possible strengths of third-party databases with regard to data quality ratings (DQRs), in order to improve the quality of datasets included in the ELCD. Although the DQR evaluation, which was carried out against the ILCD Handbook criteria, can lead to lower average DQR scores for third-party databases that are compiled using different approaches, particular strong points in terms of data quality can be highlighted and used as an example for the improvement of the ELCD.|$|E
40|$|VULNERABLE CONSUMERS MUST BE PROTECTED FROM UNSCRUPULOUS BOOK UP OPERATORS While {{acknowledged}} {{as a necessary}} service with numerous benefits, particularly for those living in regional and remote areas, 2 ̆ 7 book up 2 ̆ 7 (an informal credit provision offered by stores or other traders to Indigenous customers) continues to fall through the gap in terms of legislative regulation against unscrupulous practices. In the latest edition of the Indigenous Law Bulletin, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s* (ASIC) Nathan Boyle reports {{on the findings of}} book up research recently undertaken for ASIC by Dr Heron Loban of Griffith University, and the subsequent ASIC report, ‘Book up in Indigenous communities in Australia: A national overview’. The research findings reveal some concerning practices, including: 	operators retaining customers’ debit cards and PINs, and withdrawing funds at their discretion; 	the failure to agree on terms and provide documentation upon provision of the service to a customer; 	unauthorised use of a book up accounts by account holders’ family members; and 	creating dependency on the book up system by allowing customers to accrue high debt levels. Boyle, an analyst for ASIC’s Indigenous Outreach Program, {{is quick to point out}} that this report is not the first to highlight unscrupulous practices of some book up operators. And while book up operation is regulated by both the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), in practical terms neither instrument is effectively preventing the unscrupulous conduct, reported above, which affects the most vulnerable consumers. One of the reasons for this is that the great variance between different providers’ operations means that book up won’t always be captured by the National Credit Act’s prescriptive definition of ‘credit activities’, which, for example, requires a 62 -day period of deferment of debt, and fees and charges exceeding 5 per cent of credit provided. Even when a particular operator’s book up provision is captured by the Act, the absence of record-keeping requirements for book up operators means that where unscrupulous conduct is alleged, a lack of records often means proving that the credit activity in question satisfies the National Credit Act’s definition of a credit product is difficult. Regulation through the ASIC Act is also problematic, as the unconscionable conduct provisions of that Act are subjective and require a court’s determination, which has led to various state and federal courts arriving at different interpretations, making it, as Boyle states, ‘almost impossible to predict with any confidence the prospects of success in a matter being run purely on the basis of alleged unconscionable conduct, meaning law enforcement agencies must consider the expense and resources required to run this type of litigation and weigh this against other regulatory tools (such as informal negotiations) ’. Adding to the disincentive is the fact that not a single instituted proceeding prosecuting unconscionable conduct in book up operation has yet proceeded to a final judgment, though a pending decision in the case of ASIC v Kobelt (SAD 100 / 2014) may soon provide a valuable precedent. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell said on that matter: ‘In bringing this action before the courts, we hope to make clear the circumstances under which book up can be offered and the legal provisions by which traders must abide. ’ Boyle argues that while there seems to be a strong argument for mandating the way book up services operate, requirements like those already imposed on other financial service providers by the National Credit Act are not the answer, as they would impose onerous obligations which would be impracticable. Rather, Boyle suggests amendment to the ASIC Act setting out <b>minimum</b> <b>documentation</b> requirements and stipulating the maximum amount of indebtedness allowable, with failure to comply attracting an Infringement Notice penalty. Such an approach would allow the continuation of what is a valuable service with numerous benefits, while giving regulators the tools needed to stamp out misconduct and to ensure the most vulnerable consumers are adequately protected.  ...|$|E
