25|$|Enríquez {{expected}} to emerge stronger from this process, however, is relationship with Danío quickly {{took a turn}} for the worst. It is likely that the governor felt that the privateer was not willing to cooperate or help him during the investigation. The remainder of Enríquez's enemies <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> this and pursued his favor, leaving Pozo and his faction alone. During the course of the trial, the animosity between Danío and the privateer became evident. The residents of San Juan were surprised, being familiar with their prior affinity. None of them publicly declared the reason for the conflicts due to the contentious nature of the actions done during their partnership.|$|E

He did agree to seek {{election to the}} school board in 1921, and headed the polls at his first attempt. He served two 2-year terms on the board, spending the final year as its chairman. Early in their marriage, Clarence and Alice Howe had decided to separate their roles, with Alice Howe having full responsibility for their domestic lives. Howe took no interest in his home life; as an often-absent father he had only a small role in the upbringing of his five children. In the same manner he did not involve his wife in his business (or, later public) life. [...] During his ministerial career, he replied {{in response to an}} opposition question hinting at nepotism, [...] "I don't like to discuss my family in public. Members <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that my wife never appears on political platforms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flip-flopping {{has become}} a {{recurring}} theme in this campaign, you <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed.</b> Senator Kerry {{changed his mind about}} whether to vote to authorize the president to go to war. President Bush changed his mind about whether a homeland security department was a good idea or a 9/11 Commission was a good idea. What's wrong with a little flip-flop every now and then? ...|$|E

[...] Rowling said in O that [...] "Goudge was the only [...] whose influence I was conscious of. She always described exactly what the children were eating, and I really liked knowing what they had in their sandwiches." ...|$|E

In episode [...] "My Aim is True", it is revealed that Anne-Marie works for the Byrne Foundation, a charity founded by her husband {{for the purpose of}} research into Cardiac Valve Disease. During the course of this episode, she confides her worries about Joseph to his boss, Elliot Hope, who she later likens to a father figure to Joseph, and invites to a hospital Mexican themed evening, establishing the beginnings of potential romance. Asher has commented on their fledgling romance: [...] "Viewers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that there's a little twinkle between Lady Byrne and Elliot. They're both lonely, good-hearted people who have been through tough times. We'll have to see that emerges - but there's potential..." ...|$|E

5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>noticed</b> in prehistory and, {{in light of}} their malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons.

50|$|As Carnegie suggests, {{when we ask}} a {{colleague}} to do us a favour, we are signalling that we consider them to have something we don't, whether more intelligence, more knowledge, more skills, or whatever.

In the same way, wildflowers we <b>may</b> <b>have</b> scarely <b>noticed,</b> like meadow-rue and peppergrass, are shown to {{have the same kind of}} unlikely and stirring beauty.

50|$|Robert Bruce is an 1846 {{pastiche}} {{opera in}} three acts, with music by Gioachino Rossini and Louis Niedermeyer to a French-language libretto by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Vaëz, after Walter Scott's History of Scotland. The music was stitched together by Niedermeyer, with the composer's permission, with pieces from La donna del lago, Zelmira, and other Rossini operas. The work was premiered on 30 December 1846, by the Paris Opera at the Salle Le Peletier. The audience <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>noticed,</b> but the orchestra included {{for the first}} time a recently invented instrument, which later came to be known as the saxophone.|$|R

Both engines suffered a surge probably due to the plane's high angle of attack. Both engines RPM then decreased to values close to idle.
