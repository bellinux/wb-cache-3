25|$|Originally, {{data was}} simply passed one-way from a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. However, as time progressed, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a video card can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring {{the portion of the}} data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to transfer information bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a <b>multiplier</b> <b>effect</b> on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like genome mapping, or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present biomolecule analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.|$|E

500|$|Classical economists had {{difficulty}} explaining involuntary unemployment and recessions because they applied Say's Law {{to the labor}} market and expected that all those willing {{to work at the}} prevailing wage would be employed. In Keynes's model, employment and output are driven by aggregate demand, the sum of consumption and investment. Since consumption remains stable, most fluctuations in aggregate demand stem from investment, which is driven by many factors including expectations, [...] "animal spirits", and interest rates. Keynes argued that fiscal policy could compensate for this volatility. During downturns, government could increase spending to purchase excess goods and employ idle labor. Moreover, a <b>multiplier</b> <b>effect</b> increases the effect of this direct spending since newly employed workers would spend their income, which would percolate through the economy, while firms would invest to respond to this increase in demand.|$|E

Viewtifuls can be quickly gained by using combos or long chains of attacks. For example, while using Slow, striking a dazed enemy sets up all other enemies on the screen for a chain reaction, causing all points accrued during the duration of Slow to be multiplied by the number of enemies struck. If used deftly, the player will accumulate a large number of Viewtifuls due to the <b>multiplier</b> <b>effect</b> called [...] "X-Bonus". Each stage in Viewtiful Joe consists of several interconnected missions, or scenes, that the player must complete in order to advance. When completing the stage, the player is graded on the number of V-Points earned, the amount of time taken, and how much damage Joe took. V-Points can be used between stages to purchase new abilities, expendable weapons (which include the [...] "Voomerang" [...] and [...] "Shocking Pink Bombs"), more health, and health-restorative items.

40|$|Academic {{studies of}} local <b>multiplier</b> <b>effects</b> {{generated}} by industries or large en- terprises {{seem to be}} a ‘rara avis’ of contemporary research. This scarcity stems from a different research procedure implemented on a local scale. The lack of primary data necessary to conduct classical input-output analysis for the local level (Polish municipalities and counties) leads to the need of carrying out the company questionnaire. The survey usually entails the issue of identifying main contractors and spatial pattern of commuting practices. Moreover, in order to obtain the data about the place where employees pay taxes the employee survey is necessary. Spatial problems of estimating <b>multiplier</b> <b>effects</b> have been described based on empirical data in Krakow’s business service centers (Micek et al. 2010) and companies functioning in Special Economic Zone in Mielec (Domański et al. 2005). <b>Multiplier</b> <b>effects</b> are a form of impact effects and they may be presented as an increased employment in local companies or increased revenues of local government from corporate or personal income taxes. Employment <b>multiplier</b> <b>effects</b> are generated in cooperating companies (indirect effects) and firms which provide services for em- ployees of the analyzed business sector (induced effects). There are two problems that arise while estimating local <b>multiplier</b> <b>effects</b> described in the paper. The first issue is the ‘leakage effect’ measured in a number of jobs being generated outside the local area (community or county). The general rules concerning the lower leakage estimated for some industries (e. g. trade in comparison to market research services) are known, but attribut- ing the value of supplies to a particular sector is possible only after obtaining specific data from enterprises and critical assessment of their quality. The second issue is related to the low quality of official statistics in the fiscal system. Almost 90 % of employees of Krakow business services centers live in the city, but about 50 % of them pay taxes in their former place of residence. If the employees had paid taxes in their actual place of residence, the city would have benefited from additional 9. 8 m PLN in 2009 (twice as much than it was in fact collected). On the other hand, this change would lead to the decrease of revenues of local governments outside Malopolska region that would have lost 8 - 10 mln PLN each year...|$|R

2500|$|In 1912 Émile Durkheim {{identified}} {{society as}} the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in [...] "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life" [...] that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time. Other antecedents are Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of [...] "noosphere" [...] and H.G. Wells's concept of [...] "world brain" [...] (see also the term [...] "global brain"). Peter Russell, Elisabet Sahtouris, and Barbara Marx Hubbard (originator of the term [...] "conscious evolution") are inspired by the visions of a noosphere– a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence– an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher Pierre Lévy. In a 1962 research report, Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a <b>multiplier</b> <b>effect</b> in group problem solving: [...] "Three people working together in this augmented mode [...] {{seem to be more}} than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone". In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this big jump in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the <b>multiplier</b> <b>effect,</b> even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E
