40|$|Abstract: Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), {{also known}} as <b>melon</b> fruit <b>fly,</b> {{is one of the}} major insect pests of {{cucurbits}} in several parts of Asia, Africa and Pacific. In the present investigation, effect of lectins from two sources i. e. Arisaema intermedium Blume and Arisaema wallichianum Hook f. (Family-Araceae) has been studied on the development of second instar larvae of <b>melon</b> fruit <b>fly.</b> The lectins were incorporated separately in artificial diet at a concentration of 10 to 160 µg ml- 1 and fed adlibitum to the second instar larvae. Both the lectins were found to prolong the development period and significantly inhibited the pupation and emergence in a dose dependent manner. Total development period was found to be prolonged by 3. 5 and 2. 3 days in case of larvae fed on artificial diet containing A. intermedium (AIL) and A. wallichianum (AWL), respectively. LC 50 values calculated on the basis of adult emergence came out to be 32. 8 and 29 µg ml- 1 for AIL and AWL, respectively. Both the lectins tested, were found to increase the activity of esterases as larvae proceeded from 24 to 72 hr of treatment. The activity of acid phosphatase decreased significantly in larvae reared on diet containing LC 50 of AIL, while in case of AWL significant decrease was observed only at 72 hr of treatment. Alkaline phosphatase activity decreased significantly on treatment with both of these lectins. These results showed that AIL and AWL have promising anti-insect potential. So, lectin gene/s from either of these species can be cloned and subsequently can be employed to develop transgenics to control <b>melon</b> fruit <b>flies</b> specifically and insect pests in general. This approach could be used as a part of Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{compounds}} {{related to}} benzyl acetate were evaluated quantitatively as attractants {{to the male}} oriental fruit fly (Dacus dorsalis) and the male <b>melon</b> <b>fly</b> (Dacus cucurbitae).

Although benzyl acetate was equally attractive to both species, para substituents invariably reduced attraction to the oriental fruit fly. A number of derivatives, including p-hydroxy-, p-methoxy-, p-acetoxy-, and p-cyanobenzyl acetates were highly attractive to the <b>melon</b> <b>fly.</b> Selective fluorination indicated that the polarizability of the carbonyl carbon is important in receptor interaction with the <b>melon</b> <b>fly</b> but is not specifically involved in the oriental fruit fly.
