5|$|Cartier {{continued}} to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry {{stepped down as}} Head of Drama in 1961, he lost much of his creative independence. Barry's successor, Sydney Newman, abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as <b>Maigret</b> and Z-Cars.|$|E

25|$|Simultaneously Blethyn {{continued}} {{working on}} stage and in British television. Between 1990 and 1996 she starred in five different plays, including An Ideal Husband at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Tales from the Vienna Woods and Wildest Dreams with the Royal Shakespeare Company and her American stage debut Absent Friends, for which eventually received a Theatre World Award for Outstanding New Talent. Besides she played character parts in the BBC adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia and the ITV cricketing comedy-drama series Outside Edge, based on the play by television writer Richard Harris. Blethyn also performed {{in a variety of}} episodes of Alas Smith & Jones and <b>Maigret.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1992 {{he played}} a {{psychotic}} general in the Barry Levinson film Toys and he also starred as Georges Simenon's detective Inspector Jules <b>Maigret</b> in an ITV adaptation of Simenon's series of books. He starred as Fyodor Dostoyevsky in the Hungarian director Károly Makk's movie The Gambler (1997) about the writing of Dostoyevsky's novella The Gambler. In recent years, films such as Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), Plunkett & Macleane (1998), and Sleepy Hollow (1999), as well as television appearances in series such as Wives and Daughters (1999) (for which he won another BAFTA), a made-for-TV adaptation of Samuel Beckett's Endgame (2001) and Perfect Strangers (2001) have revealed a talent for comedy. Gambon played President Lyndon B. Johnson in the television film Path to War. For this performance, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Mini-series or Movie and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. In 2003, he appeared with Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner, playing the principal villain in the Western film Open Range.|$|E

50|$|Upon Msgr. <b>Maigret's</b> death, Msgr. Koeckemann succeeded as vicar apostolic on June 11, 1882.

With the subsequent increase in population from these migrations, Msgr. Koeckemann made Catholic education a {{priority of the}} Vicariate and built many schools. He died in 1892 and was buried at the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery in downtown Honolulu.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian actor Gino Cervi {{played the}} {{character}} on Italian television, starting from 1964 up to 1972; Simenon himself considered Cervi's {{interpretation of the}} character to be possibly the best. This series resulted in 14 novels and 2 short stories being adapted: [...] "Maigret and the Spinster", [...] "To Any Lengths", [...] "Maigret's Christmas", [...] "A Battle of Nerves", [...] "Death of a Nobody", [...] "Death of a Harbour Master", [...] "The Old Lady of Bayeux", [...] "Madame <b>Maigret's</b> Admirer", [...] "Maigret's Pipe", [...] "The Headless Corpse", [...] "Maigret and the Surly Inspector", [...] "The Lock at Charenton", [...] "Maigret on the Defensive", [...] "Madman of Bergerac", [...] "Maigret and the Loner", and [...] "Maigret in Retirement".|$|R
500|$|Four {{actors who}} each became {{well known for}} a {{particular}} role on British television had supporting parts in Quatermass II. Rupert Davies who played MP Vincent Broadhead {{would go on to}} find fame as Sûreté detective Commissaire Jules <b>Maigret,</b> the title character of 1960s TV series <b>Maigret,</b> based on Georges Simenon's novels. Roger Delgado, who found fame in the 1970s as the Master in Doctor Who (1971–73), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to [...] "the mark" [...] in episode four. Wilfrid Brambell, later star of the sitcom Steptoe and Son (1962–74) and The Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night (1964), appeared as a tramp, and Melvyn Hayes, who played the small role of Frankie, became {{one of the stars of}} the popular sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum (1974–81).|$|E
500|$|Rupert Davies as Professor Ian [...] "Mac" [...] McClaine, Joe's {{adoptive father}} and {{inventor}} of the BIG RAT. At the time of production, Davies was well known for acting the {{leading role in the}} 1960s TV adaptation of the <b>Maigret</b> novels, and was the most distinguished actor yet to contribute to an Anderson series. Experiencing typecasting {{as a result of his}} earlier role as the fictional French detective, voice acting provided Davies with the opportunity to broaden the horizons of his career. In Gerry Anderson's biography, What Made Thunderbirds Go!, Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn credit Mac's [...] "warm yet distinguished" [...] English tones as a [...] "perfect counterpoint" [...] to the American voices of the characters of Sam Loover and Shane Weston.|$|E
500|$|Supporting {{characters}} were voiced by Alexander, Healy and Anderson {{as well as}} earlier Anderson contributors Gary Files, Martin King, Jeremy Wilkin, Shane Rimmer and (for one episode, [...] "Viva Cordova") Liz Morgan. Rimmer and Morgan, however, are not credited in the closing titles. Files recalls that he felt honoured {{to be asked to}} rejoin the Andersons for another production following Captain Scarlet, and that he was [...] "tickled pink" [...] to be performing with Davies, adding, [...] "I hated the way that so many so-called producers wouldn't meet his eye. He was <b>Maigret</b> forever, you see, in their eyes." [...] Morgan, meanwhile, explains how she was contracted for her single voice role in Joe 90: [...] "They needed a voice, they called around and everyone else was out shopping. So they called me in." ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 6, 2003, {{the prestigious}} {{collection}} La Pléiade was enriched by 21 of Simenons novels. Jacques Dubois, {{president of the}} Center for Georges Simenon Studies has chosen the Simenons books, written the notes and surveys with another Walloon Simenon specialist Benoît Denis. Jacques Dubois: We were totally free to choose the 21 works which will be represented in the Pléiade. The choice was difficult and painful. And Benoît Denis: [...] We have of course included the inescapable masterpieces, The Snow Was Black, Act of Passion Mr. Hires Engagement, The Little Saint. We wanted the different periods of his life, French, American, Swiss, to be represented. As a result we have included works from his beginnings, less known, like Tropic Moon and The House by the Canal, where, nonetheless, all of Simenon is already present. We have included relatively few <b>Maigrets,</b> as these novels have a rather pronounced standard and repetitive aspect.|$|R
500|$|City of Death {{director}} Michael Hayes {{had previously}} directed the Doctor Who serials The Androids of Tara (1978) and The Armageddon Factor (1979). He also had experience filming in Paris, having worked there on adaptations of <b>Maigret</b> (1960–63) and other Georges Simenon stories for the BBC. Location filming {{took place in}} Paris between 30 April 1979 and 3 May 1979. It proved a difficult shoot as the dates coincided with the May Day holiday period, which meant {{that many of the}} locations chosen for filming were closed, necessitating considerable improvisation {{on the part of the}} cast and crew. Model filming was conducted at Bray Studios between 8 May 1979 and 10 May 1979. These concentrated on the shots of the Jagaroth spacecraft taking off from the prehistoric Earth and were overseen by Ian Scoones, a veteran of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds. Following rehearsals, production moved to BBC Television Centre where the remaining scenes were recorded in two blocks; the first [...] between 21 May 1979 and 22 May 1979 and second between 3 June 1979 and 5 June 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive marble {{work was}} done with the {{installation}} of a French marble altar. [...] It was crowned by a triptych featuring statues of Our Lady of Peace looked upon by Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. The most prominent exterior achievement for <b>Maigret</b> was the installation of the first domed bell tower in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1866, the domed bell tower was stripped from the exterior by <b>Maigret</b> and replaced with a wooden spire topped with a cross.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Michael John Gambon [...] (born 19 October 1940) is an Irish-born English {{actor who}} has worked in theatre, {{television}} and film. Gambon has played the eponymous mystery writer protagonist in the BBC television serial The Singing Detective, Jules <b>Maigret</b> in the 1990s ITV serial <b>Maigret,</b> and Professor Albus Dumbledore in the final six Harry Potter films after the death of previous actor Richard Harris. He has won four BAFTA TV Awards and three Olivier Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{bishops in}} {{residence}} at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace commissioned renovations. When Louis Desire <b>Maigret</b> inherited the church as corporation sole {{by virtue of his}} office of bishop, the interior was furnished with a simple wooden altar, communion rail and pulpit. The floors were covered in lauhala leaf mats. The cathedra, also known then as the bishop's throne, was imported and installed. Throughout his term as bishop, <b>Maigret</b> also raised the ceiling, added a choir loft and galleries overlooking the nave and paneled the ceilings with bronze ornaments.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathedral Basilica {{was built}} during Hawaii's missionary era {{and served as}} the mother church of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. [...] It was {{dedicated}} by Msgr. <b>Maigret</b> on August 15, 1843 under the title of Our Lady of Peace or Malia O Ka Malu.|$|E
2500|$|Laughton {{made his}} first color film in Paris as Inspector <b>Maigret</b> in The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949) and, wrote the Monthly Film Bulletin, [...] "appeared to overact" [...] {{alongside}} Boris Karloff as a mad French nobleman in a version of Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Door in 1951. He played a tramp in O. Henry's Full House (1952). He became the pirate Captain Kidd again, this time for comic effect, in Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952). Laughton made a guest appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour (featuring Abbott and Costello), in which he delivered the Gettysburg Address. In 1953 he played Herod Antipas in Salome, and he reprised his role as Henry VIII in Young Bess, a 1953 drama about Henry's children.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time that Congregational missionaries went about the {{construction}} of Kawaiahao Church, French Catholic missionaries of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary under the leadership of Bishop Louis <b>Maigret</b> introduced their own version of Hawaiian mission architecture. [...] The difference was that their Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace project was based on simple French church architecture in the basilica form. [...] The regional twist, like the adaptation that Congregational missionaries embraced, was the use of coral blocks from the reefs of Ala Moana and Kakaako. [...] What the Picpus religious order succeeded in doing was creating the first instance of Hawaiian architecture based on continental European styles as opposed to the American puritan styles imported by the Protestants. [...] The Picpus Fathers opened the doors to European architectural stylesclassical, baroque, renaissance, rococo and neoclassical [...] that would become uniquely Hawaiian in the hands of local builders.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{he began}} playing Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts's {{headmaster}} {{in the third}} installment of J. K. Rowling's franchise, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, taking over the role {{after the death of}} Richard Harris. (Harris had also played <b>Maigret</b> on television four years before Gambon took that role.) Gambon reprised the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was released in November 2005 in the United Kingdom and the United States. He returned to the role again in the fifth film, 2007's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He appeared in the seventh film; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts I and II, released in two parts in 2010 and 2011. Gambon told an interviewer that, when playing Dumbledore, he does not [...] "have to play anyone really. I just stick on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat. I never ease into a role—every part I play is just a variant of my own personality. I'm not really a character actor at all...'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{parallel}} with {{preparing for the}} second series of Out of the Unknown, Shubik was tasked with producing another anthology series – Thirteen Against Fate, adaptations of short stories by <b>Maigret</b> creator Georges Simenon. To assist her, Shubik was assigned a script editor – initially Rodney Gedye and then, when Gedye left following clashes with Shubik, Michael Imison. As with series one, finding suitable stories for adaptation remained a problem. On her annual visit to New York, Shubik placed an advertisement looking for stories in the Science Fiction Writers Association Bulletin. One author who answered the advertisement was Larry Eisenberg, whose stories The Fastest Draw and Too Many Cooks were commissioned. Two further adaptations, of E.M. Forster’s [...] "The Machine Stops" [...] and Mordecai Roshwald’s Level 7 (dramatised as “Level Seven”), were scripts that had been offered, without success, to film studios for some years. Another script, adapting Colin Kapp’s Lambda 1, had been commissioned for series one but shelved due to technical considerations about {{how it could be}} realised; when special effects designer Jack Kine indicated that he had a solution to the technical challenges the script was brought back into production for series two. Five further adaptations were commissioned - John Rankine’s The World in Silence, Henry Kuttner’s The Eye, Frederik Pohl’s Tunnel Under the World and Isaac Asimov’s [...] "Satisfaction Guaranteed" [...] and [...] "Reason" [...] (dramatised as “The Prophet”). Three original stories – “Frankenstein Mark II” by Hugh Whitemore, “Second Childhood” by Hugh Leonard and “Walk's End” by William Trevor – were also commissioned.|$|E
