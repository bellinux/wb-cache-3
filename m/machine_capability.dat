New method of fusion between human motor skill and <b>machine</b> <b>capability</b> is studied to transfer skill from expert to novice. Haptic-enabled Chinese handwriting training system is established as a benchmark platform for studying learning and transfer of motor skill. Perceptible element of haptic skill is proposed to model human motor skill. Four rules of machine-mediated training system are identified according to human’s skill learning characteristics. Architecture of a hierarchical hybrid control training system is proposed based on the learning rules. Phantom desktop is used as the haptic interface and haptic-visual feedback is developed for three training modes, which includes facsimile mode, transcribe mode and reciting mode.

Nevertheless variation in material properties and conditions influences the process- and product-quality. Examples are residual moisture or drying conditions by different material handling.

By a recently developed process-adapted-pressure-control during the injection phase combined with control of the switch-over point and packing-pressure, {{the quality of the}} process can be improved. Process variations by, for example, varying residual moisture content of the material are compensated by this new control strategy...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the designs}} of {{cellular}} manufacturing systems (CMS) requires that a machine population be partitioned into machine cells. Numerous methods are available for clustering machines into machine cells. One method involves using a similarity coefficient. Similarity coefficients between machines are not absolute, and they still need more attention from researchers. Although {{there are a number}} of similarity coefficients in the literature, they do not always incorporate the important properties of a similarity coefficient satisfactorily. These important properties include alternative routings, processing time, machine capacity (reliability), <b>machine</b> <b>capability</b> (flexibility), production volume, product demand, and the number of operations done on a machine. The objectives of this paper are to present a review of the literature on similarity coefficients between machines in CMS, to propose a new similarity coefficient between machines incorporating all these important properties of similarity, and to propose a machine cell heuristic approach to group machines into machine cells. An example problem is included and demonstrated in this paper...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to design a group layout of a cellular manufacturing system in a dynamic environment, in which the number of cells to be formed is variable. Cell formation (CF) and group layout (GL) are concurrently made in a dynamic environment by the integrated model, which incorporates with an extensive coverage of important manufacturing features used {{in the design of}} CMSs. Additionally, there are some features that make the presented model different from the previous studies. These features include the following: (1) the variable number of cells, (2) the integrated CF and GL decisions in a dynamic environment by a multi-objective mathematical model, and (3) two conflicting objectives that minimize the total costs (i.e., costs of intra and inter-cell material handling, machine relocation, purchasing new machines, machine overhead, machine processing, and forming cells) and minimize the imbalance of workload among cells. Furthermore, the presented model considers some limitations, such as <b>machine</b> <b>capability,</b> machine capacity, part demands satisfaction, cell size, material flow conservation, and location assignment. Four numerical examples are solved by the GAMS software to illustrate the promising results obtained by the incorporated features.|$|E
