500|$|Most {{songs from}} Back to Basics were {{inspired}} by real-life events that Aguilera had experienced. The track [...] "Oh Mother" [...] talks about Aguilera's childhood with her abusive father; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna's [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989). Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album, with tracks inspired by the event including [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray", [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "On Our Way", [...] "Without You", [...] "Mercy on Me", [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] and [...] "The Right Man". On [...] "The Right Man", Aguilera expresses that she has found [...] "the right man" [...] for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child {{would not have to}} experience an abusive childhood like her, [...] "One day, <b>My</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> will reach out her hand and she'll know I found the right man".|$|E
500|$|From a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents {{stressed}} the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay [...] "out of trouble". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Girl</b> (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was {{the only member of the}} chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E

Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming {{her role in the}} film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that".
