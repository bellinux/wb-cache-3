40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} demonstrated {{the ability of}} electric fields to dissociate ascorbate and catecholamines and shown that the electric field generated by cell membranes is sufficient to produce dissociation of these complexes up to 8 nm from the cell membrane. We show here that this process is applicable {{to a wide range}} of biological complexes including small molecules (norepinephrine-morphine sulfate), protein-protein complexes (insulin-glucagon), and small molecule-protein complexes (epinephrine-bovine serum albumin). The extrapolation of the slope of the electric field dependence to zero electric field can be used to estimate the log of the dissociation constant (KD) of a complex and, by multiplying the log(KD) by − 2. 303 <b>RT,</b> the <b>association</b> energy (E) of the complex. The slope of the electric field dependence is inversely related to the molecular radii, with the best fit of the slope related to E*(1 /r 1 + 1 /r 2), where r is the estimated radius of each molecule in the complementary pair. This indicates that the binding site of the pair is shielded by the remaining parts of the molecules, and the larger the molecule the greater the shielding. When the slope of the electric field dependence goes to 0 as r goes to infinity and 1 /r goes to 0, the molecular shielding constant is 7. 04 × 10 − 8 cm 2 /V. Very large complexes will be minimally affected by the electric field due to molecular shielding and reduced electric field as their radius restricts approach to the membrane. Large protein receptors will deflect the membrane electric field and allow agonist binding...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} radiotherapy (<b>RT)</b> in <b>association</b> with complete second look operation, histologically confirmed, on outcome of patients with IRS Gr. III non-alveolar RMS. PROCEDURE: We analyzed data from 39 patients (age: 0. 5 - 194 months, median 52) who were enrolled between 1988 and 2005 in 2 consecutive Italian Studies, RMS 88 and RMS 96. All achieved a complete resection of the residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 27 did not receive any other local treatment: pelvic 8, extremities 6, head-neck-non-parameningeal 5, orbit 1, genito-urinary-bladder-prostate 3, trunk 2, abdomen 1, vagina 1; 12 were given RT (32 - 45 Gy), 5 before and 7 after the operation: genito-urinary-bladder-prostate 3, pelvic 3, abdominal 1, extremities 1, head-neck-parameningeal 1, head-neck-non-parameningeal 1, vagina 1, orbit 1. All received postoperative chemotherapy. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 81 months (range 17 - 219 months). With RT: 10 / 12 patients are in first complete remission; 2 / 12 had a metastatic relapse (1 also local relapse), {{and both of them}} died of disease. Without RT: 16 / 27 maintained the first complete remission, however 1 / 16 died due to a second tumor; 8 suffered from local relapse (4 pelvic, 1 orbit, 1 vagina, 1 head-neck-non-parameningeal, 1 abdomen) and 3 of them died, 3 showed a metastatic recurrence (2 extremities, 1 pelvic) and 1 died. CONCLUSIONS: Local relapses were more frequent for patients without RT, especially in pelvic sites. The two relapses after RT occurred in huge bladder-prostate RMS.

This self-reference effect (SRE) in memory appears diminished in ASD and related {{to the number of}} ASD traits manifested by neurotypical individuals (fewer traits = larger SRE). Here, we report the first experiments exploring the relation between ASD and the SRE in perception. Using a “Shapes” Task (Sui et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 38, 1105, 2012), participants learned to associate three different shapes (triangle, circle, square) with three different labels representing self, a familiar other, or an unfamiliar other (e. g., “you”, “mother”, “stranger”). Participants then completed trials during which they were presented with one shape and one label for 100 ms, and made judgments about whether the shape and label was a match. In Experiment 1, neurotypical participants (n = 124) showed the expected SRE, detecting self-related matches more reliably and quickly than matches involving familiar or unfamiliar other. Most important, number of ASD traits was unrelated {{to the size of the}} SRE for either accuracy or <b>RT.</b> Bayesian <b>association</b> analyses strongly supported the null hypothesis. In Experiment 2, there were no differences between 22 adults with ASD and 21 matched comparison adults in performance on the Shapes Task.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare patient-reported {{xerostomia}} during daytime {{and during}} nighttime with objectively measured parotid and submandibular gland {{function in a}} cohort of head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with RT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 138 HNC patients underwent objective measurements of parotid (PF) and submandibular (SMF) gland function and completed a xerostomia questionnaire (XQ) before RT, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after RT. No {{attempt was made to}} spare the submandibular gland(s). The XQ contained specific questions concerning the sensation of dry mouth during day- (XD) and nighttime (XN), scored on a 5 -point Likert scale. Patients with no or mild (grade 1 - 3) xerostomia and patients with more severe (grade 4 - 5) complaints were grouped together. RESULTS: Before <b>RT,</b> no <b>association</b> existed between dry mouth complaints and PF or SMF. At 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after RT; 37 %, 51 % and 36 % had grade 4 - 5 XD and 65 %, 64 % and 56 % had grade 4 - 5 XN, respectively. Patients with grade 4 - 5 XD and XN had significantly worse SMF at all time points after RT compared to patients with grade 1 - 3 XD and XN, while PF was significantly worse only at 6 weeks after RT. In multivariate analyses, SMF was consistently the most important factor related to XN after treatment. PF significantly influenced XD at 6 weeks and 1 year after RT. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating between complaints during day- and nighttime in xerostomia research is necessary. Dry mouth at night is a frequent problem after (parotid-sparing) RT for HNC and is explained by submandibular gland dysfunction. Sparing of the contralateral submandibular gland, in addition to parotid gland sparing, may result in improved patient-reported xerostomia...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) and {{chemotherapy}} may prolong survival in older patients (age ≥ 70 years) with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), although the survival benefits remain poor. This Phase II multicenter {{study was designed}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) in older patients with GBM. Patients and Methods: Seventy-one eligible patients 70 years of age or older with newly diagnosed GBM and a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 were treated with a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) plus TMZ at the dosage of 75 mg/m 2 per day followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m 2 for 5 days during each 28 -day cycle). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and toxicity. Results: The Median OS was 12. 4 months, and the 1 -year and 2 -year OS rates were 58 % and 20 %, respectively. The median and 1 -year rates of progression-free survival were 6 months and 20 %, respectively. All patients completed the planned programme of RT. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 16 patients (22 %). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 10 patients (15 %), leading to the interruption of treatment in 6 patients (8 %). Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient. Conclusions: A combination of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ is well tolerated and may prolong survival in elderly patients with GBM.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Safety {{considerations}} {{require that}} biological products for human use are free from any agent that might pose a potential health hazard. One method {{to detect the}} presence of retroviral particles is the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. This assay is capable of detecting all infectious retrovirus particles, irrespective of genome or protein composition. Recently, a family of ultrasensitive RT tests, named product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assays, has been designed with a detection limit that is 10 (6) - 10 (7) times {{lower than that of}} conventional RT tests. OBJECTIVES: To investigate with the PERT assay whether RT activity is detectable in live attenuated virus vaccines and to characterize eventual RT activities. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 12 different monovalent and one trivalent virus vaccines containing live attenuated viruses were tested for RT activity with the PERT assay and a conventional RT test. RT activities were investigated with respect to their susceptibility to <b>RT</b> inhibitors, <b>association</b> with physical particles, and their possible origin. RESULTS: One trivalent and five different monovalent vaccines contained RT activity when tested with the PERT assay, but were negative in a conventional RT assay. All lots tested of these vaccines showed RT activity. The activity in all vaccines was sensitive to AZT-triphosphate and ddTTP and at least part of it was associated with particles. Mg(2 +) -dependent RT activity banded at a density of 1. 14 g/ml. All positive vaccines were produced using chicken cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate the systematic presence of partially particle-associated retroviral reverse transcriptase in attenuated live virus vaccines that are produced in chicken-derived cells. The identification and further characterization of these particles, as well as the elucidation of possible interactions with the human organism are imperative goals despite the fact that these vaccines have been safely used for many years...|$|R

Here we investigated whether the microstructure of the WM underlying and connecting the right fronto-parietal cortices was associated with sustained attention performance in a group of 76 typically developing children aged 7 - 13 years. Sustained attention was assessed using a rapid visual information processing paradigm. The two behavioral measures of interest were the sensitivity index d′ and the coefficient of variation in reaction times (RT CV). Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from the WM underlying right dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and parietal cortex (PC), and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), as well as equivalent anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the left hemisphere and mean global WM FA. When analyzed collectively, right hemisphere ROIs FA was significantly associated with d′ independently of age. Follow-up analyses revealed that only FA of right SLF and the superior part of the right PC contributed significantly to this <b>association.</b> <b>RT</b> CV was significantly associated with right superior PC FA, but not with right SLF FA.

The present study assessed <b>RTs</b> to examine <b>associations</b> with CV responses to mental stress in healthy, older individuals using robust regression techniques. Participants were 262 men and women (mean age[*]=[*] 63. 3 [*]±[*] 5. 5 years) from the Whitehall II cohort who completed a RT task (Stroop) and underwent acute mental stress (mirror tracing) to elicit CV responses.

Our aim was to determine the distribution of hs-CRP in an effort to identify the MetS variable that is critical in modulating plasma CRP levels in a population of South African adolescents. Design: A cross-sectional analytical study design was used for this investigation, where the dependent and independent variables were measured simultaneously. Methods: Anthropometric variables, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids were performed on 324 consenting learners aged 15 – 18 years from three different ethnic groups (Black, White and Coloured). The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) for ages 15 – 18 year olds was used to define MetS. Results: The prevalence of MetS and obesity was 3. 7 % and 7. 1 %, respectively. The hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in subjects with a waist-circumference greater than the 90 th percentile (p < 0. 01) and in obese learners with MetS, but was lower in adolescents with normal weight and MetS. Median hs-CRP levels increased with an increasing number of metabolic abnormalities and exceeded 3 mg/L in 19 % of adolescents. Gender and ethnic differences were observed. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that obesity and waist circumference appear to be major mediators of hs-CRP levels in South African adolescents. Publishers Versio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} whether the general slowing hypothesis (GSH) could be extended to the motor domain by comparing cognitive and motor age-related slowing. To achieve this objective, we compared the slopes of Hick-Hyman's law and Fitts' law, in young and older adults. The general hypothesis was that, due to the dedifferentiation of cognitive and motor neural resources during aging, the slopes of Hick-Hyman's law and Fitts' law should become closer, if not similar, in older adults. Ten young adults (mean age = 26 +/- 3 years) and 14 older adults (mean age = 78 +/- 7 years) participated in the experiment. They had to perform a discrete rapid-aiming task and a reaction time (RT) task. In the aiming task, five index of difficulty (ID) levels were used (from three to seven bits by increments of 1. 0 bit). Task difficulty was scaled via the manipulation of target distance from home position. In the RT task, five IDs were selected: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 bits, with incompatible SR <b>associations.</b> <b>RT</b> and movement times were recorded. Efficiency and Brinley regression functions were calculated. Age-related slowing ratios were estimated. Response times increased in both tasks in older adults. The slopes of Hick-Hyman's law and Fitts' law were steeper in older adults than in young participants. In young participants, the slope of Hick-Hyman's law was smaller than that of Fitts' law. In older adults, no difference was found. Slowing ratios observed in both tasks were equivalent. The present results extended the GSH to the motor domain. They suggested that, due to dedifferentiation of cognitive and motor neural resources, decrease in processing speed acts as a common cause to behavioral slowing in both cognitive and motor tasks...|$|R
40|$|Wilms’ tumour (WT) is {{the most}} common primary {{genitourinary}} tumour of childhood with the annual incidence of approximately 8 per million children younger than 15 years of age. Genetic {{plays an important role in}} this cancer. WT 1 located on chromosome 11 p 13, WT 2 on 11 p 15, loci at 1 p, 7 p, 16 q, 17 p (the p 53 tumor suppressor gene), and 19 q (the putative familial WT gene FWT 2) are believed to harbor genes involved in the biology of WT. The majority of these children are surviving into adult life and due to the combination of genetic susceptibility, irradiation and antineoplastic treatment, are at increased risk for second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We report the case of a young man with a parotid carcinoma occurring thirteen years after diagnosis of WT. The patient was initially treated according to the SIOP 6 Nephroblastoma protocol, comprising a 4 -week two-drug (Actinomycin D, Vincristine) presurgical treatment, nephrectomy and 22 -week treatment with biweekly Actinomycin D and Vincristine. No radiation therapy was given. Nine months after the end of therapy he experienced an isolated hepatic relapse, treated with Peptichemio (450 mg/m 2), two courses of Cisplatin (40 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days) and Etoposide (100 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days) and two cycles of the combination Ifosfamide (2 gr/m 2 /day for 5 days), Doxorubicin (40 mg/m 2 /day for 2 days), Vincristine (1. 5 mg/m 2). Resection of a complete necrotic lesion at the fourth hepatic segment was subsequently performed. Treatment was completed with high dose association of Melphalan (200 mg/M 2) and Vincristine (4 mg/M 2) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). After 13 years since WT diagnosis and 11 years after BMT the patient presented a right non tender, homogeneous and mobile parotideal mass. After the total parotidectomy the diagnosis was consistent with a low-grade mucoepidermoidal carcinoma. In the National WT Study Group review regarding 43 SMNs out of 5278 patients enrolled between 1969 and 1991 the relevant risk factor for developing a SMN were radiation therapy (<b>RT),</b> the <b>association</b> of Doxo-rubicin and RT and utilization of chemo-therapy for the treatment of the relapse. All these risk factors were present in the only reported case of parotideal carcinoma in these series. In the SIOP survey RT was related to secondary bone cancer and the use of epipodophyllotoxin with leukemia occurrence. On these basis in our patient a clear pathogenetic mechanism is lacking, then we can also attribute the secondary parotid carcinoma simply to the chance. Physician needto be aware that even unusual SMNs, can develop also in subjects that for their primary malignancy and related treatment are at low risk...|$|R

Material andWe retrospectively assessed pediatric cancer survivors with GH deficiency, submitted to GH treatment from 1988 to 2010 in a tertiary level hospital. We analised the following data: sex, age, oncologic diagnosis, oncologic treatment, auxology, Tanner puberty stage, final height, target height and other associated endocrine problems. We determined the height z-score difference between the beginning and the end of GH treatment (for patients who ended treatment), and between the beginning of GH treatment and the last observation (for patients who are currently on treatment), which was defined as the dependent variable. SPSS® version 17. 0 was used for statistical analysis. A sample of 18 patients was obtained, 12 male, with a median age of cancer diagnosis of six years old. The diagnostics were CNS tumors (n= 15) and hematologic neoplasia (n= 3). Cancer treatment modalities were craniospinal RT (n= 9), cranial RT (n= 4), chemotherapy (n= 14) and CNS surgery (n= 15). The median of time between cancer treatment and beginning of GH treatment was 4 years and 8 months. Height z-score difference was positive in 12 patients. Statistical significant differences between medians and centiles of height z-score difference occurred in patients submitted to craniospinal RT (- 0. 08), cranial RT (0. 59) and no RT (1. 56) (p= 0. 003, IC 95 %). The biggest differences between final height and target height (- 10 and - 11. 5 cm) occurred in two patients submitted to craniospinal RT, with associated precocious puberty.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{contrast}} to studies {{of depression and}} psychosis, {{the first part of}} this study showed no major differences in serum levels of cytokines and tryptophan metabolites between healthy children and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder of the combined type (ADHD). Yet, small decreases of potentially toxic kynurenine metabolites and increases of cytokines were evident in subgroups. Therefore we examined predictions of biochemical associations with the major symptom clusters, measures of attention and response variability. Methods We explored systematically associations of 8 cytokines (indicators of pro/anti-inflammatory function) and 5 tryptophan metabolites with symptom ratings (e. g. anxiety, opposition, inattention) and continuous performance test (CPT) measures (e. g. movement, response time (RT), variability) in 35 ADHD (14 on medication) and 21 control children. Predictions from linear regressions (controlled by the false discovery rate) confirmed or disconfirmed partial correlations accounting for age, body mass and socio-economic status. Results (1) Total symptom ratings were associated with increases of the interleukins IL- 16 and IL- 13, where relations of IL- 16 (along with decreased S 100 B) with hyperactivity, and IL- 13 with inattention were notable. Opposition ratings were predicted by increased IL- 2 in ADHD and IL- 6 in control children. (2) In the CPT, IL- 16 related to motor measures and errors of commission, while IL- 13 was associated with errors of omission. Increased RT variability related to lower TNF-α, but to higher IFN-γ levels. (3) Tryptophan metabolites were not significantly related to symptoms. But increased tryptophan predicted errors of omission, its breakdown predicted errors of commission and kynurenine levels related to faster <b>RTs.</b> Conclusions Many <b>associations</b> were found across diagnostic groups even though they were more marked in one group. This confirms the quantitative trait nature of these features. Conceptually the relationships of the pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines distinguished between behaviours associated more with cognitive or more with motor control respectively. Further study should extend the number of immunological and metabolic markers to confirm or refute the trends reported here and examine their stability from childhood to adolescence in a longitudinal design. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reaction time (RT) {{has played}} a {{prominent}} part in research on mental ability for over a century. Throughout this time {{a number of questions}} have been repeatedly posed: what is the relationship of RT to general mental ability, and is this the same for simple and choice RT? Does the relationship change with age? How important is RT variability compared with mean values? Here we examine these questions in three population representative cohorts. Methods: Participants were drawn from the West of Scotland Twenty- 07 study, a longitudinal population based study designed to investigate socially structured health inequalities. At the fourth wave of data collection, part I of the Alice Heim 4 (AH 4) test of general intelligence was administered, and reaction times were measured using a portable device. Means and standard deviations were recorded for simple and 4 -choice reaction time. Full data were available for 2196 participants, comprising 714 aged 30 years, 813 aged 50, and 669 aged 69. Results: Correlations of simple RT means with AH 4 scores were − 0. 27, − 0. 30 and − 0. 32, for age 30, 50 and 69, respectively; and − 0. 44, − 0. 47 and − 0. 53 for 4 -choice RT. The underlying relationships showed evidence of non-linearity, particularly for simple <b>RT,</b> with stronger <b>association</b> at lower AH 4 scores. This was more pronounced with age. RT variability was correlated with the mean at 0. 57, 0. 57, 0. 58 for simple RT; and 0. 53, 0. 53, 0. 47 for choice RT. Residuals from regressing the RT variability on the mean showed no association with AH 4 in the case of simple RT but a weak <b>association</b> for choice <b>RT</b> which decreased with age. Conclusions: There is a strong correlation of RT means with general mental ability which increases with age. The underlying relationship is complex for SRT. RT variability shows little association with mental ability when its dependence on the mean is removed. Combining samples with disparate ages may overestimate the association...|$|R

National {{estimates of the}} impact of post-operative complications, specifically, septicemia occurring during hospitalization for RT's on outcomes is unclear. We sought, to examine the prevalence of septicemia in patients having renal transplantation procedures and to quantify the impact of septicemia on in-hospital mortality (IHM), length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges (HC). We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the years 2004 to 2010. All patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent <b>RT</b> were selected. <b>Association</b> between occurrence of septicemia and outcomes (IHM, HC and LOS) was examined by multivariable linear and logistic regression models with adjustments for patient and hospital level confounders. During the study period, 113, 058 patients underwent RT, and, of these, 2459 (2. 2 %) developed septicemia. Characteristics included mean age (50 years), gender (males, 60 %) and race (whites, 54 %). Majority of RT's were performed in teaching (96 %) and large institutes (85. 5 %). Outcomes for patients with septicemia and without septicemia, included: IHM (12. 9 % vs. 0. 4 %), discharge routinely (42. 4 % vs. 82. 6 %), mean HC ($ 528, 980 vs. $ 182, 165), mean LOS in days (35. 2 vs 7. 3), respectively, Those who developed septicemia were associated with significantly higher HC (estimate: 0. 8357, 95 % CI: { 0. 7636 - 0. 9077 }, increase of $ 247, 081 from mean, p< 0. 0001), longer LOS (1. 2116 { 1. 1015 - 1. 3216 }, increase of 18. 7 days form mean, p< 0. 0001) and higher IHM (Odds ratio = 31. 33; { 20. 25 - 48. 48 }, p < 0. 0001) compared to their counterparts. Increasing age (OR = 1. 02 { 1. 01 - 1. 02 }, p< 0. 0001) and increase in co-morbid burden (OR = 1. 57 { 1. 42 - 1. 74 }, p< 0. 0001) were associated with higher risk for developing septicemia. Despite advances in medical/surgical care, septicemia is not an uncommon complication in patients having renal transplantation procedures and is associated with poor outcomes.

40|$|The {{basis for}} sex {{differences}} in cognitive ability remains poorly defined and controversial both scientifically and politically. One of the biological hypotheses on sex differences, of particular relevance to this thesis, concerns the role of gonadal steroids, specifically testosterone (T) and oestrogen, {{and their relationship to}} individual differences in the performance of specific cognitive tasks. In addition, the role that age-related changes in these hormones play in relation to generalised and pathological cognitive ageing in males is studied. It is important to determine whether decreases in T levels that occur with ageing in males are associated with age-related decreases in cognitive performance because T levels can potentially be modified. Males have consistently been found to outperform females on measures of visuo-spatial function; performance on the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (MRT) shows the largest and most robust of sex differences. Gonadal steroids have both organisational and activational effects which contribute to both withinsex variability and between-{{sex differences in}} visuo-spatial cognition. As males age, endogenous plasma T levels decline gradually yet variably between individuals. Studies in older males show improvement in visuo-spatial cognition following T supplementation; however, it remains to be resolved whether decreases in endogenous T levels with ageing are associated with poorer MRT performance. Some recent studies in older males have reported positive correlations between measures of plasma T levels and cognitive functioning, including processing speed and executive function measures. These data are inconsistent, however, and important questions remain concerning, for example: the age at which the effect is strongest; whether there are different effects at different ages; whether there is an optimal level at which T levels affect particular abilities; and which abilities show the strongest association with endogenous plasma T levels. Increased intra-individual variability in performance on Choice Reaction Time (RT) tasks has recently been shown to be a strong predictor of cognitive functioning in university students. Methodological advances in the analyses of RT distributions has allowed for the calculation of robust estimates of intra-individual <b>RT</b> variability. The <b>association</b> between these estimates and cognitive performance in middle and older aged males, however, remains to be determined. Further, the association between endogenous plasma T levels and intra-individual RT variability in aged males is unknown. The thesis addresses these issues; firstly, through cross-sectional analyses of the associations between different measures of plasma T levels, learning and memory, processing speed, and executive function performance in a large population based sample of 1046 men aged between 35 and 81 years. Secondly, further cross-sectional analyses are reported from a subsequent study in a healthy sub-sample of 96 of these men on the associations between endogenous plasma T levels, MRT performance, constituent abilities related to MRT performance, and performance on composite measures of both processing speed and executive function. In a third study, these data are re-analysed in relation to intra-individual variability in RT performance. In light of the results of these studies, the role that age-related declines in plasma T levels play in relation to generalised age-related cognitive decline in males is discussed. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder, initiated by arterial wall injury, mediated by well-recognised cardiovascular {{risk factors and}} culminating in formation of plaques, the patho-biological substrate that precedes events such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Intraplaque neovascularisation (IPN) {{is one of several}} defence mechanisms in response to atherosclerosis. With development of an atherosclerotic plaque within the intima, the distance between the deeper intimal layers and the luminal surface increases, producing hypoxia within the arterial wall. This stimulates release of pro-angiogenic factors that induces neoangiogenesis in an attempt to normalise oxygen tension. However, these neo-vessels are fragile, immature and leaky and thought to be the primary cause of intraplaque haemorrhage, now appreciated to be a key risk factor for plaque rupture. Therefore, the presence of IPN is now widely recognised as a precursor of the “vulnerable plaque”. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive method of imaging carotid plaques and, as contrast bubbles travel wherever erythrocytes travel, they permit visualization of IPN. Prior research studies have demonstrated that CEUS can detect IPN {{with a high degree of}} accuracy (on comparison with histological plaque specimens) and have shown a relationship between extent of plaque neovessels and plaque echogenicity and between plaque neovascularization and prior cardiovascular events. However, CEUS is a relatively recently described imaging technique and there were a number of unanswered questions in this field, some of which formed the basis for study in this research Thesis. In this Thesis, research studies were conducted on human subjects using CEUS imaging to identify IPN and its determinants. The incidence and determinants of IPN in healthy asymptomatic individuals was unknown and was studied in subjects from the London Life Sciences Population (LOLIPOP) study, a large study exploring mechanisms for differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) between South Asian and European White individuals. The study found that approximately half of all plaques contain IPN. The only variable associated with IPN presence in an adjusted analysis was Asian ethnicity. This finding potentially has significant implications as it may help explain, in part, the greater CVD burden observed in Asian populations. A study comparing visualization of the carotid tree during B-mode and CEUS imaging was also conducted. Both IMT visualization and plaque detection were significantly improved by CEUS, implying that CEUS is superior to B-mode imaging for detection of sub-clinical atherosclerosis. Radiotherapy (RT) damages arterial walls and promotes atherosclerosis. The carotid arteries frequently receive significant incidental doses of radiation during RT treatment of head and neck cancers. The effect of RT on plaque composition – specifically IPN – had not been studied and thus a collaborative cardio-oncological study was conducted to assess the effects of RT upon IPN in cancer survivors who had previously received <b>RT.</b> A significant <b>association</b> between <b>RT</b> and IPN was found which may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased stroke risk amongst cancer survivors treated by RT. Finally, a collaboration with biophysicists was formed to develop and validate a novel algorithm for quantitative analysis of IPN. Patients clinically scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy were recruited and underwent CEUS imaging prior to surgery. This study did not achieve its principal aims due to challenges with patient recruitment, challenges in image quality and with the quantification software also. Future directions of study in this promising field have been addressed in the thesis summary. Open Acces...|$|R
