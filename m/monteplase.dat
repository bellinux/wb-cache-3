40|$|AbstractA 24 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to our hospital with the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and left common iliac vein thrombosis. She had used low-dose contraceptive pill for dysmenorrhea. Otherwise, her laboratory data did not show any other thrombotic risk factors. Thrombus in the common iliac vein usually requires a permanent inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. However, the use of long-term warfarin should have been avoided for her potential future pregnancy. A retrievable IVC filter was placed and catheter directed thrombolysis was performed for her deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Local injection of <b>monteplase</b> from a pulse spray catheter was performed for 4 days. After the catheter-based treatment, the thrombus resolved and the IVC filter was successfully removed on day 19. The patient was discharged on day 21. Warfarin therapy was discontinued 6 months after discharge. <Learning objective: Urokinase is recommended in the guideline of the Japanese Circulation Society. But the dose is much less than those stated in guidelines overseas. Several {{studies have shown that}} tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) might be more effective than urokinase. We report a case in which local injection of <b>monteplase,</b> a type of long acting t-PA, for DVT was effective in treating PTE and DVT. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of a {{ruptured}} eye with a suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) in which tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) -assisted vitrectomy was successful in reconstructing the globe and restoring good vision. Case: A 32 -year-old man was struck on the right eye by a surfboard. His eye was ruptured and his visual acuity decreased to hand movements. Surgery was immediately performed to successfully close the ruptured globe. Nine days later, a second surgery was performed, and tPA (25 µg/ 0. 1 ml <b>monteplase)</b> was used to liquefy and drain the SCH. This freed enough vitreous space for a more comprehensive vitrectomy. Eighteen months after the injury, the retina remained attached, and the decimal best-corrected visual acuity improved to 0. 8. Conclusion: tPA was helpful in lysing a massive SCH, thereby contributing to the excellent visual outcome. tPA-assisted drainage should be considered in cases of massive SCH when drainage is difficult due to an incomplete lysis of the clot...|$|E
40|$|Arterial {{thrombosis}} is {{the underlying}} cause {{of a wide variety}} of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases. All the currently used thrombolytic agents are very efficient in restoring the blood flow. The recent development in thrombolytic drugs, including the third-generation thromblytic agents and natural thromblytic agents, was presented in this article. The thrombolytic mechanism, adverse reaction and the clinical application of these drugs were especially introduced. Most of the third-generation thromblytic agents are variants of tissue type plasmino-gen activator, such as reteplase, <b>monteplase,</b> tenecteplase and lanoteplase. All of them and some natural thromblytic agents including staphylokinase, lumbrokinase and hirudin are plasminogen activators,which can convert plasminogen into plasmin and thus degrade fibrin. They showed considerable potential with higher potency,specific thrombolytic activity,fibrin selectivity and longer half-life time,but all these agents suffer from a number of inadequacies including resistance to reperfusion,occurrence of coronary reocclusion and bleeding complications. The thrombolytic mechanism of nattokinase and fibrinolytic enzyme in douchi is specific,and it won’t cause bleeding complications. The further develoment of thrombolytic agents is how they can get safer and cheaper...|$|E
