[...] For méi-xiāng (fragrant) <b>salted</b> <b>fish,</b> fish with thicker bodies such as Scomberomorus (jiaoyu (鮫魚))and mayau are preferred. It takes 7-8 days for méi-xiāng <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> to ferment, after which it is seasoned with salt and dried in the sun.

Previous studies suggested that <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> intake was a risk of nasopharyngeal cancer. Hence, this study was carried out to evaluate gene mutation effects through the induction of mutagenic effect of aqueous and methanol extracts of <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> from Balik Pulau, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. Balik Pulau was chosen for sampling purpose due to its popularity as a commercial centre for local raw fisheries in Malaysia. Evaluation of mutagenic effect {{was carried out by}} hprt Gene Mutation Assay towards V 79 lung fibroblast cells. It was found that the aqueous and methanol extracts of <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> were not cytotoxic towards V 79 lung fibroblast cells. It was also found that the extracts of <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> from Balik Pulau were not mutagenic towards hprt gene of V 79 lung fibroblast cells as the mutation frequency of the extracts did not exceed 3 times of the value for negative control mutation frequency. In conclusion, both aqueous and methanol extracts of <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> from Balik Pulau did not have gene mutation effect towards hprt gene in vitro.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for a hypothesis that eating <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is reviewed. The hypothesis was tested among Malaysian Chinese using a matched case-control design. The kinds of <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> and patterns of use were also investigated in a control group comprising 100 Chinese, 50 Malay and 50 Indian households. During 1980, in Selangor, Malaysia, interviews with 100 Chinese cases of NPC and 100 non-disease controls indicated that <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption during childhood was a significant risk (relative RISK = 3. 0, P = 0. 04), with an elevated risk for daily as opposed to less frequent consumption. <b>Salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption during adolescence was a less significant risk, and current consumption not at all. There were 19 kinds of fishes reported as being eaten as <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> by the 200 control households. There were marked differences between ethnic groups in preference for different kinds: Chinese preferred red snapper (74 % of households), Malay jewfish (54 %) and Indian red snapper (28 %). <b>Salted</b> <b>fish</b> was hardly ever eaten daily by any household; weekly was a moderate frequency in all ethnic groups; less than weekly most common.

40|$|Background: Despite <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> being a {{classical}} risk factor of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC), whether secular trends in <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption worldwide accounted {{for changes in}} NPC rates were unknown. The relationship between vegetable and cigarette consumption to NPC risk worldwide were also largely uncertain. We investigated the longitudinal trends in standardised NPC incidence/mortality rates across 8 regions and their associations with secular trends in <b>salted</b> <b>fish,</b> vegetable and tobacco consumptions. Methods: Age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) and age standardised incidence rate (ASIR) of NPC {{were obtained from the}} WHO cancer mortality database and Hong Kong Cancer Registry. Per capita consumption of <b>salted</b> <b>fish,</b> tobacco and vegetables in Hong Kong and 7 countries (China, Finland, Japan, Portugal, Singapore, United Kingdom and United States) were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (FAO) and Hong Kong Trade and Census Statistics. Pearson correlation and multivariate analysis were performed to examine both crude and adjusted associations. Results: There were markedly decreasing trends of NPC ASIR and ASMR in Hong Kong over the past three decades, which were correlated with corresponding secular changes in <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption per capita (Pearson r for 10 cumulative years : ASIR = 0. 729 (male), 0. 674 (female); ASMR = 0. 943 (male), 0. 622 (female), all p 0. 05). However, there were no clear or consistent patterns in relations between NPC ASIR and ASMR with <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption across 7 regions in 3 continents. Conclusions: Our results do not support the notion that changes in <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> consumption had {{played an important role in}} explaining secular trends of NPC rates in Hong Kong and worldwide. Further studies should explore other lifestyle and genetic factors. However, our findings do support the potentially protective effects of vegetable consumption against NPC. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Since <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> is traditionally eaten with rice, part of a staple diet for children and the poor segment of Southern China, these are the populations that are at highest risk of NPC.
