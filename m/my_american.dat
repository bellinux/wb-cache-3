5|$|Two {{weeks before}} {{starting}} a tour {{to promote the}} album, John Hembree joined the band to replace bassist Jeremy Davis, though Davis ended up rejoining the group after five months away from the band. In February, the group went on Midwest and east coast tour with Halifax, <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Heart, and So They Say. Through the spring of 2006, Paramore was an opening act on tours for both Bayside and The Rocket Summer. The band was initially planned {{to appear on the}} 2006 edition of the Take Action Tour in early March 2006, but Williams came down with flu, which resulted in the band being replaced by Sullivan. The band went on the 2006 edition of the Warped Tour, which took place in Nashville, near the group's hometown. In August and September, the band headlined a tour in the United States with support from Hit the Lights, Cute Is What We Aim For and This Providence, followed by some dates in the United Kingdom in October.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnam War had a {{profound}} effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Journey. The Powell Doctrine, as the views became known, was a central component of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf War (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and U.S. invasion of Afghanistan (the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{military}} retirement, Powell wrote his best-selling autobiography, <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Journey. In addition, he pursued {{a career as}} a public speaker, addressing audiences across the country and abroad. Prior to his appointment as Secretary of State, Powell was the chairman of America's Promise - The Alliance for Youth, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to mobilizing people from every sector of American life to build the character and competence of young people. He was nominated by President Bush on December 16, 2000 as Secretary of State. After being unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he was sworn in as the 65th Secretary of State on January 20, 2001.|$|E

Following this, Independent Label Group, who help promote and market Fearless releases, persuaded Target Corporation to sell A Lesson in Romantics in its stores. The video for [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was released through MTV on July 21. The song was released to radio on September 2. In October and November, the band supported All Time Low on the Compromising of Integrity, Morality, & Principles in Exchange for Money tour.

500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gibbons [...] produced five more novels, as well as two poetry collections, a children's book, and a number of short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the Holly Lodge Estate off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons regularly worked in the mornings from ten until lunchtime. [...] Her novels were generally well received by critics and the public, though none earned the accolades or attention that had been given to Cold Comfort Farm; [...] readers of The Times were specifically warned not to expect Gibbons's second novel, [...] Bassett (1934), to be a repetition of the earlier masterpiece. Enbury Heath (1935) is a relatively faithful account of her childhood and early adult life with, according to Oliver, [...] "only the thinnest veil of fictional gauze cover raw experience". Miss Linsey and Pa (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her analysis of women writers from 1914 to 1939, to parody Radclyffe Hall's [...] 1928 lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness. Gibbons's final prewar novels were [...] Nightingale Wood (1935)—"Cinderella brought right up to date"—and <b>My</b> <b>American</b> (1939), which Oliver considers her most escapist novel, [...] "a variant of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen." ...|$|E

As a lieutenant colonel serving in South Korea, Powell {{was very close}} to General Henry [...] "Gunfighter" [...] Emerson. Powell said he regarded Emerson {{as one of the most}} caring officers he ever met. Emerson insisted his troops train at night to fight a possible North Korean attack, and made them repeatedly watch the television film Brian's Song to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare. After a race riot occurred, in which African American soldiers almost killed a Caucasian officer, Powell was charged by Emerson to crack down on black militants; Powell's efforts led to the discharge of one soldier, and other efforts to reduce racial tensions.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2004 {{the band}} played at the Atlantis Music Conference in Atlanta. Rory from The Militia Group saw the band's performance. The band signed to The Militia Group, who re-released the band's EP. A month after the signing, the band {{recorded}} a demo of [...] "Honestly" [...] as a [...] "kind of trial thing" [...] with Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount as the band were looking for producers. In September, the band toured with <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Heart, A Second Chance and All Rights Reserved.

2500|$|In 1995 Pleasant Company {{released}} {{a line of}} contemporary dolls called American Girl of Today. In 2006 the product line was renamed Just Like You; it was changed again in 2010, to <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Girl, and in 2015 to Truly Me. This line has included sixty-eight different dolls over the years. Each doll has a different combination of face mold, skin tone, eye color, and hair color, length, texture, and/or style. American Girl states that this variety allows customers to choose dolls that [...] "represent the individuality and diversity of today's American girls." [...] A wide variety of contemporary clothing, accessories, and furniture is also available, and there are regular releases and retirements to update this line. Each year, a Girl of the Year doll is released who has her own special talent. For example, Mia St. Clair, the Girl of the Year for 2008, did ice skating; and Marisol Luna, the Girl of the Year for 2005, was a dancer.|$|E

2500|$|With Providence (1977), Resnais {{made his}} first film in English, with a {{screenplay}} written by David Mercer, and a cast that included John Gielgud and Dirk Bogarde. The story shows an ageing, maybe dying, novelist grappling with alternative versions of his own past as he adapts them for his fiction. Resnais was eager that the dark subject should remain humorous, and he described it as [...] "a macabre divertissement". Formal innovation characterised Mon oncle d'Amérique (<b>My</b> <b>American</b> Uncle, 1980) in which the theories of the neurobiologist Henri Laborit about animal behaviour are juxtaposed with three interwoven fictional stories; and a further counterpoint to the fictional characters {{is provided by the}} inclusion of film extracts of the classic French film actors with whom they identify. The film won several international awards including the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, and it also proved to be one of Resnais's most successful with the public.|$|E
2500|$|In fall 2005, five Thursday demo {{songs were}} stolen from the iPod of the tour manager for <b>My</b> <b>American</b> Heart, a band Rickly had {{recently}} collaborated with for their song [...] "We Are the Fabrication". The band issued a statement on their official website stating that they were disappointed the unfinished products leaked, but that they were glad that people take that much interest in their music. The band confirmed the title of one demo, [...] "At This Velocity" [...] and promised it would make their upcoming album. Three other songs ("The Other Side of the Crash/Over and Out (Of Control)", [...] "Telegraph Avenue Kiss", and [...] "Autumn Leaves Revisited") would also make the album, while the remaining demo would later become the song [...] "Last Call" [...] on their fifth studio album, Common Existence. Thursday had originally {{toyed with the idea}} of a double album to follow up War All the Time but the idea was scrapped, reporting on their website that they believed [...] "not even The Beatles could properly fill two discs with enough worthy material".|$|E

He was approached on behalf of the British Government with the suggestion that if he would become a British subject the Government would be pleased to give him an important executive post and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him. His answer was: [...] "I'll do what I can for you with pleasure; but I'll be damned if I'll give up <b>my</b> <b>American</b> citizenship—not on your life!" [...] Within the last six months two large financial organizations, each independently, have offered him $100,000 a year to enter their service; and an industrial company offered him $100,000 [...] "to start with." [...] He declined them all. When the Belgian relief work recently struck a financial snag, Hoover by telegraph got the promise of a loan in the United States to the British and French governments for Belgian relief of $150,000,000.|$|E

In July 2007 Seth Rogen, in addition to starring in the lead role, was hired to co-write the script with frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg. Columbia also hired Rogen as an executive producer for The Green Hornet. Rogen in July 2007 said he had not begun writing the screenplay yet, but anticipated the tone would be that of [...] "a buddy action movie" [...] with humor, [...] "like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs.. In September 2008, Columbia Pictures announced a June 25, 2010, release date, and that Hong Kong star Stephen Chow had signed to direct and to co-star as Kato. Chow, a fan of the TV show as a kid, explained, [...] "The idea of stepping into Bruce Lee's shoes as Kato is both humbling and thrilling, and to get the chance to direct the project as <b>my</b> <b>American</b> movie debut is simply a dream come true." [...] Chow dropped out as director the following December over creative differences. On February 24, 2009, Columbia Pictures announced that Michel Gondry would direct the film, on which Chow had remained as Kato, after impressing Columbia production presidents Doug Belgrad and Matt Tolmach with his pitch. Gondry had previously been involved with The Green Hornet when Universal Pictures was planning its version in 1997.|$|E
