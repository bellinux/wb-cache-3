The aim of this research was to compare autonomous <b>mower</b> with traditional <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> on a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) lawn under different nitrogen (N) rates. A two-way factor experimental design with three replications was adopted. In the study, fourNrates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kghaL 1) and two mowing systems (autonomous mower vs. gasolinepowered walk-behind <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> equipped for mulching) were used. As expected, N fertilization increased turf quality. At the end of the trial, the autonomous mower increased turf density (3. 2 shoots/cm 2) compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 1 shoots/cm 2) and decreased average leaf width (2. 1 mm) compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 7 mm).

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> with {{internal}} combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter steel decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price {{is the most}} important selling point.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> rotates about a {{vertical}} axis with the blade spinning {{at high speed}} relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends {{to result in a}} rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13 mm) than a standard four-wheeled rotary.|$|R

40|$|O manejo das entrelinhas dos pomares de citros tem sofrido grandes alterações nos últimos anos. Dessa forma, este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar influência da adubação verde de inverno e o uso de roçadoras laterais, na produção da laranjeira-'Pera'[Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck]. O ensaio foi conduzido em duas safras (2007 / 2008 e 2008 / 2009), em esquema de parcela subdividida, onde, nas parcelas, semearam-se três espécies de inverno (aveia-preta, tremoço e nabo forrageiro) e nas subparcelas utilizaram-se dois tipos de roçadoras laterais (convencional e "ecológica"). Vegetação espontânea e herbicida (glyphosate) em área total foram tratamentos de referência. No mês de julho (2007 e 2008), quantificaram-se a massa verde e a seca das vegetações intercalares e da projeção da copa, após roçagem. Para o cálculo da produção da laranjeira-'Pera', colheram-se os frutos das diferentes parcelas, efetuando-se as pesagens e, posteriormente, obtendo-se a eficiência de produção. Os tratamentos com adubo verde proporcionaram maior produção de massa verde e seca, e a utilização da roçadora "ecológica" lançou quantidade de {{material}} vegetal significativamente superior sob a copa das plantas de laranjeira-'Pera'. Nas duas safras, maior produção e eficiência de produção de frutos foi observada nas parcelas com uso da roçadora "ecológica". Quanto aos adubos verdes de inverno, apenas o tremoço incrementou a eficiência de produção em 2009. Conclui-se que o uso de roçadora "ecológica" incrementa a produção de laranjeira-'Pera'. The inter-row {{management of}} citrus orchards has undergone {{major changes in}} recent years. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of winter cover crops and <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> in sweet orange 'Pêra' production. The experiment was conducted in two seasons (2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009), in a split plot design, where at the plots three species of winter cover crops (oat, lupine and radish) were sown in April and in sub-plots it was used two types of <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (conventional and ecological). Natural vegetation (NV) and NV+herbicide (glyphosate) in the total area were the standard treatments of the experiment. In July (2007 and 2008) it was measured the mass of fresh and dry mass of each treatment and also after mowing. To calculate the production in August (2007 and 2008) the fruit were harvested and weighted and later it was obtained the efficiency of production. The treatments with winter cover crops showed greater production of fresh and dry mass {{and the use of}} ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> released amount of plant material significantly higher under the canopy of sweet orange 'Pera' plants. In two seasons, higher production and efficiency of fruit production occurred in plots using the ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Only lupines increased the efficiency of production of sweet orange 'Pêra' in 2009. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> increases the production of sweet orange 'Pera'...|$|R

The results of measurement of the energy demands of the mulcher with vertical axis of rotation are presented. The dependency of input power, specific energy consumption and fuel consumption on mass performance of the machine are created. Furthermore, the energy demands was determined, while mulcher was working continuously at the permanent grassland. The energy losses of the mulcher were also analyzed. The effect of modification of operational and constructional parameters on the energy demands and quality of work of the mulcher wit vertical axis of rotation is studied. From the constructional parameters the shape of working tool, especially cloth angle and rake angle of the tool, and shape of the cover of the mulcher workspace is modified.

40|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{is one of}} mowing tools {{commonly}} used to maintain lawn or turfgrass. Mowing height and mowing torque are important factors that {{should be taken into}} account in sustaining grass quality and designing a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> The study was addressed to recognize the influence ofmowing height to required mowing torque. The mowing torque was measured at mowing height of 2, 3 and 4 em. Measurement of mowing torque in the field was done by using a specially designed turfgrass mowing apparatus that representing rotary mowing mechanism. The apparatus was equipped with torque measurement system. The average measured torque was used to calculate the power requirement of mowing. The needs of maximum and minimum mowing torque to mow turfgrass for all mowing height were 0, 68 Nm and 0, 05 Nm. The average of mowing torque were 0, 51 Nm, 0, 24 Nm, and 0, 08 Nm, at mowing height of 2, 3 and 4 em respectively.

Para isto, implantou-se a seringueira (PB 235 e RRIM 701) em Latossolo Vermelho em Jaboticabal-SP, em 1992, de forma que a área da entrelinha da cultura foi manejada com gradagem, roçadora e cultura de cobertura kudzu-tropical (Pueraria phaseoloides). Após 8 anos de cultivo, foram analisados alguns atributos físicos do solo (densidade, macro, micro e porosidade total, granulometria e argila dispersa em água), na entrelinha da cultura. O manejo mecânico e o de culturas de cobertura na entrelinha da seringueira afetaram as propriedades físicas do solo, especialmente a porosidade e a densidade, entretanto não influenciaram significativamente a granulometria do solo. As maiores alterações físicas em função do manejo da entrelinha da seringueira manifestaram-se especialmente na camada {{superficial}} do solo (0 - 20 cm).
