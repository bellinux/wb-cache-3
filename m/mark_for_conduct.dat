50|$|Numerous sources reveal that, in {{the years}} {{following}} the ravaging of Mann and plundering of the Isles, Rǫgnvaldr bound himself closer to the English Crown. Whilst at Lambeth on 16 May 1212, for instance, during what was likely his second visit to England in six years, Rǫgnvaldr formally swore that he was John's liegeman. Rǫgnvaldr's visit to England is corroborated by a record, dated 20 May, regarding the English Crown's payment of ten <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> Rǫgnvaldr home. Further corroboration is provided by the record, dated 16 May, concerning the release of some of Rǫgnvaldr's men who had been held in custody at Porchester and Dover.|$|R
500|$|Alfred {{intended}} to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward {{was sent to a}} day school in Philadelphia and in 1853 at the age of 12, Edward was sent to the Friends' Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), and provided much of the Cope family's education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, [...] "a bit of a spoiled brat". His letters suggest he was lonely at the school—it {{was the first time he}} had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical boy—he consistently had [...] "less than perfect" [...] or [...] "not quite satisfactory" [...] <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> <b>conduct</b> from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} IT on the {{decision}} making structure of firms has been a topic of debate for decades. On the one hand, IT increases the information available to top management, and the coordination advantages that it provides may lead firms to centralize decision making. On the other hand, IT {{makes it possible to}} disseminate global information of the firm to line workers enabling them to make better decisions as well as enhances management’s monitoring capability, favoring decentralization. In order to understand the economy wide effects of centralization and decentralization of decision rights on the productivity effect of IT, we conduct an empirical analysis to examine the change in the effects of IT performance in firms that changed its decision making structure, using a panel data set for 2, 300 Japanese firms over 4 years. Our results indicate that both centralization and decentralization have a substantial productivity effect on IT for firms that changed its decision making structure and the productivity effects are more <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> firms that <b>conducted</b> radical change of decision rights. Moreover, we find evidence that changes in decision rights have a more pronounced productivity effect on large firms. Finally, our results show that productivity effects due to changes in decision rights are realized only in the non-manufacturing sectors. This paper sheds some light on the effects of decision rights on firms...|$|R
