5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a <b>monetary</b> <b>penalty.</b> The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items. In addition to the main game itself, {{there is also a}} competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter their teams into an arena to battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.|$|E

40|$|This {{series of}} papers investigates {{money as a}} {{criminal}} sanction {{using a variety of}} approaches. Paper 1, "Money As A Criminal Penalty: Its Uses and Meanings," explores the theoretical underpinnings and empirical use of <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties,</b> providing a thorough assessment of the complexities entailed in the fair and efficient use of these sanctions. Paper 2, "Substitute & Supplement: The Multiple Functions of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Penalties</b> in Federal Sentencing," uses an innovative approach of focusing on severity and likelihood for both sanctions. The results of hierarchical linear modeling suggest that <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties</b> are used as both a substitute and supplement to incarceration. The main contribution is a more accurate characterization of the relationship between prison and <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties.</b> Paper 3, "Assessing the Effect of Booker on <b>Monetary</b> <b>Penalties</b> and Prison," explores the effect of the Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Booker (2005) on the use of <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties</b> and incarceration in federal sentencing. This analysis uses a matching algorithm to create comparison groups with more balanced observable characteristics. The result is consistent evidence that race and gender continue to be quite influential in sentencing outcomes and that greater post-Booker judicial discretion is associated with more volatility in the use of <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties</b> than prison. By providing a thorough, multi-faceted, and methodologically rigorous account of <b>monetary</b> <b>penalties,</b> these papers significantly advance our understanding of a ubiquitous and complex criminal sanction...|$|R

Men have called the law gender discrimination in that women cannot be prosecuted for adultery and the National Commission of Women has criticized the British era law of being anti-feminist as it treats women as the property of their husbands and has consequently recommended deletion of the law or reducing it to a civil offense.

2500|$|One of {{the first}} acts by Adolf Hitler after the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 gave him de facto legal {{dictatorship}} over the German state was to pass the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring (Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses) in July 1933.

Under it, all doctors in the Third Reich were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed intellectually disabled, characterized mentally ill (including schizophrenia and manic depression), epileptic, blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep <b>monetary</b> <b>penalty</b> was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from alcoholism or Huntington's Disease could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of Nazi officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race [...] "Rhineland Bastards" [...] were also sterilized beginning in 1937. The sterilization program went on until the war started, with about 600,000 people sterilized.|$|E
