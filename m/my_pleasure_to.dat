500|$|The leading tenor part of Don José {{was given}} to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had {{recently}} appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was {{at the beginning of}} a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her [...] "one of the most charming vocalists it has been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> know". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.|$|E

500|$|Disillusioned by her firing from Dr. Vegas, Adams, at 30 years old, {{considered}} {{looking for}} an alternate career after finishing work on the sole project she was signed to. It was the independent comedy-drama Junebug, which had a production budget of under $1 million. Directed by Phil Morrison, the film featured Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman. Morrison was impressed by Adams' ability to not question her character's inherently good motives. She found a connection with Johnsten's faith in God, and spent time with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (where the film is set), attending Sunday church. She described making the film as [...] "the summer I grew into myself", and after dyeing her hair red for the part, she decided to {{not go back to}} her natural blonde color. Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph labeled the film a [...] "small, quiet miracle" [...] and wrote that Adams had given [...] "one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> review". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post opined that her [...] "radiant portrayal" [...] reflected the film's [...] "deeply humanist heart". Adams received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E

One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> meet. In {{all the time in the}} camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E
