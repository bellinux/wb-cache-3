5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's {{not the kind of}} song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E

And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
2500|$|Before joining Green Day, Tré Cool {{employed}} a more intricate drumming style. [...] He explained that [...] "When I started, I {{had too many}} drums. I was a little reggae-happy and into fancier beats than was needed. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get it: play the song, don't play the instrument. I started {{figuring out how to}} make the band a stronger unit, to make it jump." [...] After playing with Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt, Tré Cool adopted a more rhythmic style with fewer drum fills to match Dirnt's bass lines.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Binchy [...] "suffered {{a health}} crisis {{related to a}} heart condition", which {{inspired}} her to write Heart and Soul. The book about (what Binchy terms) [...] "a heart failure clinic" [...] in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital. Towards {{the end of her}} life, Binchy had the following message on her official website: [...] "My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> reply." ...|$|E

In the meanwhile, I've been {{wondering}} about that waggon. It took <b>me</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> screw the lock-nut on with the big box-spanner, and the thing never loosened of itself." ...|$|R
2500|$|It took an {{interval}} of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged {{to what is}} usually called the [...] "new economic geography" [...] (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, [...] "Increasing Returns and Economic Geography", published in the Journal of Political Economy. In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was [...] "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying {{on the sidewalk in}} the interim." [...] This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper [...] "the love of my life in academic work." ...|$|E

Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. I think {{for a long time}} I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive. ... I have been really really fortunate in that regard." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{revival of}} Mr. Gracedieu's spirits {{indicated}} a temporary change only, and was {{already beginning to}} pass away. The eyes which had looked lovingly at Eunice began to look languidly now: his head sank on the pillow {{with a sigh of}} weak content.

5000|$|Referring to {{his career}} as an actor and his passion for music, Bridges says, [...] "I dug what an actor did, but it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> feel it, to truly {{appreciate}} the craft and the preparation.

On my last album I tried to write a song of love about my daughter but it wound up being about junkies and sleaze. It's taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> meet the challenge, I hope I've done it with songs like 'Diamonds to Coal'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reid {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University in 1938 and a Master of Education degree from University of California, Berkeley in 1949.

[...] "Only for a time," [...] he repeated, on recovering the power. [...] "You see, I've {{got a little bit}} of business to transact down at Yarmouth, and it will take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good <b>while</b> <b>to</b> do it.

6000|$|... "It was a he, then," [...] said I. [...] "We {{were the}} two best lads at my father's school, and we thought we loved each other dearly. Well, the time came {{when he went to}} Glasgow to a merchant's house, that was his second cousin once removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and then he found new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took no notice. Eh, Catriona, it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while</b> <b>to</b> forgive the world. There is not {{anything}} more bitter than to lose a fancied friend." ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{father and}} I never really {{achieved}} a real relationship. We probably {{saw each other}} 20 or 25 times in our lifetime. When you are able, at my age, to count the times you have seen your father, it says something...

60|$|The white rock, visible enough {{above the}} brush, was still some eighth {{of a mile}} farther down the spit, and it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> goodish <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get up with it, crawling, often on all-fours, among the scrub. Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was an {{exceedingly}} small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in {{the centre of the}} dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies carry about with them in England.|$|R
500|$|In the {{beginning}} it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>to</b> {{get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|R
6000|$|Also that hankering {{after an}} overt or {{practical}} effect seems to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> apostasy. In good earnest I {{am willing to}} spare this most unnecessary deal of doing.

5000|$|The album's {{departure}} from the darker lyrics of Headless Cross was discussed by Tony Iommi in his 2012 autobiography Iron Man: [...] "For our next album, Tyr, {{we went back to}} the Woodcray Studios in February 1990, with me and Cozy producing it again. On Headless Cross, Tony Martin had just come into the band and he assumed, oh, Black Sabbath, it's all about the Devil, so his lyrics were full of the Devil and Satan. It was too much in your face. We told him to be a bit more subtle about it, so for Tyr he did all these lyrics about Nordic gods and whatnot. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get my head around that." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{that school}} {{were the first}} Jews I had ever seen. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get over the awe of it. To my fancy they were clothed invisibly in the damp and cobwebby mould of antiquity. They carried me back to Egypt, and in {{imagination}} I moved among the Pharaohs and all the shadowy celebrities of that remote age. The name of the boys was Levin. We had a collective name for them which was the only really large and handsome witticism that was ever born in that Congressional district.
