In the Netherlands following some local experiments, <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> was promoted nationally as early as 1976 by the medical profession itself and became a mandatory activity under the Hospital Licensing Act of 1984. In England it was the government who promoted <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> as a compulsory activity for medical specialists, in particular since 1989. In this article the development and introduction of <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> in the two health care systems is described {{and its impact on}} the clinical autonomy of medical specialists gauged. It is concluded that in both countries external pressures seem to have been crucial in the 'compulsory' introduction of <b>medical</b> <b>audit.</b> Although there are differences in the organisation and culture of the medical profession in the two countries, in both countries <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> turned out to be an instrument 'controlled' by the profession itself. The question whether <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> is instrumental in preserving clinical autonomy has also been addressed. Our conclusion is that in its present form <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> in the two countries has not been a threat to the clinical autonomy of the medical profession. At the same time it is clear that the study of one quality instrument is insufficient to draw conclusions about the development of clinical autonomy, let alone autonomy in general.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} facility-based case reviews (<b>medical</b> <b>audits)</b> in a maternity unit and their effect on the staff involved. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: A 26 -bed obstetric unit in a district hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. SAMPLE: Sixteen audit sessions conducted between February 2004 and June 2005. Thirty-five staff members were interviewed. METHODS: An analysis of all the tools used {{in the management of}} the audit was performed: attendance lists, case summary cards and register of recommendations. The perceptions of the staff about the audits were collected through a questionnaire administrated by an external investigator from 10 June 2005 to 16 June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Session participation, types of problems identified, recommendations proposed and implemented and staff reaction to the audits. RESULTS: Only 7 midwives from a total of 15 regularly attended the sessions. Eighty-two percent of the recommendations made during the audits have been implemented, but sometimes after a delay of several months. Interviewed personnel had a good understanding of the audit goals and viewed audit as a factor in changing their practice. However, midwives highlighted problems of bad interpersonal communication and lack of anonymity during the audit sessions, and pointed out the difficulty of practising self-criticism.

Many physicians rely on office staff and billing companies to process their medical bills without ever reviewing the bills before they are submitted for payment.

This article emphasizes the importance of monitoring and <b>auditing</b> <b>medical</b> record documentation and coding application as a strategy for achieving compliance and reducing billing errors.

40|$|Purpose: The {{provision}} of health promotion information {{is an important}} part of the management of hospitalised patients. Allied health practitioners are often involved in the {{provision of}} this information. No studies appear to have documented the rate of provision of health promotion material by physiotherapists to hospitalised patients. The aim of this pilot study was to measure the frequency with which health promotion information was provided to in-patients by physiotherapists and to evaluate patients’ perception of the effectiveness of this information. Method: Retrospective <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> and follow-up telephone interviews were undertaken over an 18 month period for patients who fell into one of the following four diagnostic groups: total hip arthroplasty (THA), after upper limb lymph node biopsy/removal and therefore at risk of upper limb lymphoedema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or accidental fall requiring admission to hospital. Results: 63 patients participated in the <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> and 50 participated in the telephone interviews. The <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> revealed that 64 % of patients were provided with some health promotion information during their hospitalisation. From the telephone interviews, 88 % of patients indicated that they were happy with the information they had received. However, the rate of provision of health promotion material was significantly lower for patients with COPD or those admitted after a fall. Conclusions: While the overall level of provision of health promotion material by physiotherapists was satisfactory, provision of this material to COPD patients and those admitted after a fall needs to become part of physiotherapists’ standard clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Improvements in {{the quality}} of health care {{services}} are often measured using data present in medical records. Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) contain potentially valuable new sources of health data. However, data quality in EMRs may not be optimal and should be assessed. Data reliability (are the same data elements being measured over time?) is a prerequisite for data validity (are the data accurate?). Our objective was to measure the reliability of data for preventive services in primary care EMRs during the transition to EMR. Methods Our data sources were randomly selected eligible patients’ medical records and data obtained from provincial administrative datasets. Eighteen community-based family physicians in Toronto, Ontario that implemented EMRs starting in 2006 participated in this study. We measured the proportion of patients eligible for a service (Pap smear, screening mammogram or influenza vaccination) that received the service. We compared the change in rates of selected preventive services calculated from the <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> with the change in administrative datasets. Results In the first year of EMR use (2006) services decreased by 8. 7 % more (95 % CI − 11. 0 %–[*]−[*] 6. 4 %, p [*] p [*]=[*] 0. 05) in the <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> during the second year of EMR use (2007). Conclusion There were differences between the change measured through <b>medical</b> record <b>audits</b> and administrative datasets.

SETTING [...] All 85 general practices in Oxfordshire; all 95 <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> advisory groups in England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Level of practices' audit activity as measured by rating scale and grid. Use of scale nationally together with perceptions of strengths and weaknesses as perceived by chairs of <b>medical</b> <b>audit</b> advisory groups. RESULTS [...] After one year Oxfordshire practices more than attained the target standards set in 1991, with 72 % doing audit involving setting target standards or implementing change; by 1993 this had risen to 78 %.
