5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory {{after the age of}} sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition.

5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy speaker and sat on standing committees for libraries, <b>municipal</b> <b>law,</b> and education. His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend {{the boundaries of the}} Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works. He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E

25|$|In {{internal}} politics, Magnus {{carried out}} a great effort to modernise the law-code, which gave him his epithet law-mender. These were adopted at the Things in the years 1274 (Landslov) and 1276 (Byloven). In 1274 he promulgated the new national law, a unified code of laws {{to apply for the}} whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland. This replaced the different regional laws which had existed before. It was supplemented by a new <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> (a law for the cities) in 1276, and a slightly modified version was also drawn up for Iceland. A unified code of laws for a whole country was at this time something quite new, which had until then only been introduced in Sicily and Castile. His code introduced the concept that crime is an offense against the state rather than against the individual and thus narrowed the possibilities of personal vengeance. It increased the formal power of the king, making the throne the source of justice. The <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> gave the cities increased freedom from rural control. A specific section fixed the law of succession to the throne, in accordance with the arrangements laid down by King Håkon Håkonsson in 1260.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that he argued more causes than any other lawyer who practiced in Connecticut {{during the first half}} of the nineteenth century. He did comparatively little office-business, but devoted his time to the trial of causes in court, and he also for more than twenty-five years attended the Legislature as an advocate in cases pending before that body. He was deeply interested in the administration of justice as provided for by legislative enactment, and many of the statutes of the State in the Department of <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> during his active life were drawn up and their passage procured by him.|$|E
25|$|Until 1849, today's Liberty Street, {{then called}} Northern Row, was the {{corporation}} line forming Cincinnati's northern boundary.

In 1955, the city decided to widen Liberty Street to connect with Reading Road as an east-west cross town access point for the interstate highway system.

Efforts are underway to narrow Liberty Street to bridge the gap between these halves of the neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|As a consent-based process, {{ensuring}} {{rights under}} the ICCPR internationally is fraught with difficulty. The mechanism relies on member states to implement standards by way of incorporation of ICCPR principles into <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> or implementation through conduct. Where implementing ICCPR principles into domestic law would conflict existing policy or law, a state may ignore such a principle. New Zealand for example, has been considered slow in incorporating ICCPR principles for the reason of Parliamentary Supremacy; it may not restrict future Parliaments by strictly adopting all principles into law. A further issue is in delay between making reports and consideration by the HRC. There have been many attempts for this reason, to reform the treaty body system and make systems more effective, coherent and coordinated.|$|E
25|$|As the property-owner is {{the owner}} of the public streets, {{sidewalks}} and the utility poles on which symbolic boundaries are to be strung, some authorities have interpreted Jewish law as requiring the local government to participate in the process as one of the property owners by agreeing to creation of the eruv, and to give permission {{for the construction of a}} symbolic boundary on its property. In addition, because <b>municipal</b> <b>law</b> and the rules of utility companies, in general, prohibit third parties from stringing attachments to utility poles and wires, the creation of an eruv has often necessitated obtaining permissions, easements, and exceptions to various local ordinances. These requirements that government give active permission for an eruv have given rise to both political and legal controversy.|$|E
