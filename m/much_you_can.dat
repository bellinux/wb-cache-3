500|$|Banks {{elaborated}} {{that she}} wanted a judge on the program that had gone through issues in her modeling career that she herself had not: [...] "I sit {{all the time and}} talk to girls and say, 'Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't go out. Don't do this. I never did it.' But there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> preach to someone if you've never done it. I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous." [...] Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:" [...] When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I {{thought it was a good}} balance." ...|$|E
500|$|Boonen, who {{finished}} fifteenth, described Sagan as [...] "really strong" [...] {{and as the}} [...] "deserved winner"; he said [...] "The way [...] rode up the Paterberg was a good showcase on how to ride a bike". Boonen, meanwhile, {{turned his attention to}} Paris–Roubaix the following week. Van Avermaet described himself as [...] "really disappointed" [...] following his crash, which ruled him out of Paris–Roubaix. Luke Rowe's fifth place was Team Sky's best ever performance in the Tour of Flanders; he praised Kwiatkowski's move, but said [...] "there’s not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do when someone has better legs"; he described Sagan, Cancellara and Vanmarcke as [...] "the three strongest guys in the race". Imanol Erviti, {{who had been in the}} breakaway for , finished seventh. Cycling Weekly described this as [...] "phenomenal"; it was Movistar's best ever result.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Writing for The A.V. Club, Rowan Kaiser {{gave the}} episode a positive review, {{stating that the}} characters knowing facts that the audience doesn't worked. [...] "'Donut Run' actually does this well, {{in large part because}} the heist that we're seeing—Duncan and Veronica stealing the coma baby—requires that Duncan and Veronica stage a breakup, meaning that Veronica seems to be a free, bitter agent for the bulk of the episode." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com heavily praised what he called a [...] "great episode" [...] and [...] "a fitting send-off for Duncan". He elaborated that [...] "as much as he and Veronica were a good match, there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do dramatically with a happy relationship, you know? I'm kind of glad she's back to being a free agent again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The bathroom {{was the only}} set {{that had to be}} built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E
500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. Then somebody said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut your picture, that is too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2007, Giuliani {{was more}} {{amenable}} to a flat tax, but still claimed difficulties in adopting one. [...] In an interview, he said: [...] "If {{we were doing}} income tax for the first time. In other words, if we were starting off new back {{at the beginning of}} the last century, then probably we should go with a – we probably should've gone with a flat tax, maybe two levels of tax, but really simple. Our economy has kind of grown up now on depreciation and deductions and industries have grown up around that and so I don't know exactly how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> simplify it, but you sure have to make a stab at it." [...] Later that week, in accepting Forbes' endorsement of his own presidential candidacy, Giuliani said that [...] "a flat tax would make a lot of sense".|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is pretty amazing how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see {{and the number of}} windows out there with wide open shades... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E
