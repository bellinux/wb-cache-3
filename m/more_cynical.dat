5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E

Set years after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, the game features an older, <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> and macabre incarnation of Alice.|$|E
25|$|Desdemona is {{concerned}} {{over the loss}} of the handkerchief but maintains that its loss will not cause Othello to grow angry. Emilia is <b>more</b> <b>cynical,</b> especially after Othello violently asks to see it. Desdemona is confused over her husband's behaviour, which culminates in his striking her in public and calling her a whore.|$|E

50|$|From then on, Preiss {{was largely}} typecast {{in the role}} of the upright and obligation-conscious German officer to the other A-list actor playing the fanatic (i.e. Paul Scofield in The Train), a part he played in many films, later reprising it in {{numerous}} international productions, predominantly in Italy and the USA, while occasionally playing a <b>more</b> typically <b>cynical</b> or brutal Nazi officer.|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} album, First Light, was warmly {{received by}} the critics but did not sell particularly well. Neither did its follow up, 1979's harder-edged and <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> Sunnyvista. Chrysalis Records did not take up their option to renew the contract, and the Thompsons found themselves without a contract, but not without admirers.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} of players {{by the general}} public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid. This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of the cat, Jiji, changed significantly in the Disney version. In the Japanese version Jiji is voiced by Rei Sakuma, while in the English version Jiji is voiced by comedian Phil Hartman. In Japanese culture, cats are usually depicted with feminine voices, whereas in American culture their voices are more gender-specific. A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> and sarcastic attitude in the Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese.|$|E
60|$|Poland {{has been}} {{presented}} with three proclamations. Two {{of them were in}} such contrast with the avowed principles and the historic action for the last hundred years (since the Congress of Vienna) of the Powers concerned, that they were <b>more</b> like <b>cynical</b> insults to the nation's deepest feelings, its memory and its intelligence, than state papers of a conciliatory nature.|$|R
5000|$|The early {{scenes in}} the play {{delineate}} two factions: the virtuous courtiers, Arioldus, Clephis, and Andrucho/Aribert, {{are opposed to the}} <b>more</b> amoral, <b>cynical</b> and self-interested courtiers, Antharis, Asprandus, and Iseas. Antharis and Clephis are old rivals; but their children, respectively son Alcidonus and daughter Selina, are in love and secretly married [...] - [...] though parental opposition forces them to conceal the fact and live apart.|$|R
50|$|Mako {{along with}} his brother Bolin were {{designed}} by Ryu Ki-Hyun. Mako went {{through a number of}} design changes. Joaquim Dos Santos originally wanted both characters to have strong noses, however the idea was nixed. It was decided that as the younger brother, Bolin's character would have a somewhat simplistic and naive view of the world, while Mako's character as the older brother and provider for the two, would be <b>more</b> reserved, <b>cynical</b> and serious in nature.|$|R
500|$|In the series' {{third season}} opener, 2002's [...] "The Algae's Always Greener," [...] Plankton refers to Karen {{as his wife}} for the first time. Aspects of their marriage, such as their anniversary and their honeymoon, have become the {{frequent}} focus of episodes since then. In early episodes, Karen is always supportive and friendly toward her husband. But, as the series progresses, she becomes <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> and sarcastic because of Plankton's relentless obsession with the Krabby Patty formula. However, she remains loving and affectionate toward him.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're <b>more</b> <b>cynical,</b> more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E
500|$|Troilus and Cressidas sources include Chaucer, Lydgate, Caxton and Homer, {{but there}} are creations of Shakespeare's own too and his tone is very different. Shakespeare wrote {{at a time when}} the traditions of courtly love were dead and when England was {{undergoing}} political and social change. Shakespeare's treatment of the theme of Troilus' love is much <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> than Chaucer's, and the character of Pandarus is now grotesque. Indeed, all the heroes of the Trojan War are degraded and mocked. Troilus' actions are subject to the gaze and commentary of both the venal Pandarus and of the cynical Thersites who tells us: ...|$|E

50|$|BBC Radio 1 {{presenter}} Chris Moyles {{was heavily}} critical of both songs and recorded and broadcast his own spoof version—"We Want You to Leave"—claiming that both singles were {{the product of}} what amounted to nothing <b>more</b> than a <b>cynical</b> marketing ploy by Eamon and Frankee's record labels.|$|R
500|$|Stewart himself {{says that}} he does not {{perceive}} his show as cynical. [...] "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern critics, however, have a <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> {{view of the}} 18th-century use of {{the term}} [...] "madness" [...] when {{diagnosing}} patients; psychiatrist Thomas Szasz viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural. Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher Michel Foucault emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition. In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of [...] "great confinement". This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, [...] "the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} playable {{characters}} of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as [...] "YRP" [...] ("YuRiPa" [...] {{in the original}} Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from Final Fantasy X, and, though their personalities are {{much the same as}} before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Final Fantasy Xs world as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Her personality is far <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and she keeps her past a secret from them for much of the game.|$|E
5000|$|BBC Radio 1 {{presenter}} Chris Moyles {{was heavily}} critical of both songs, going {{as far as}} to record and broadcast his own spoof version; [...] "We Want You to Leave", claiming that both singles were the product of what amounted to nothing <b>more</b> than a <b>cynical</b> marketing ploy by Eamon and Frankee's record labels.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} ukiyozōshi is its intense realism. Since late kanazoshi literature, a shift towards commoner literature and realism had been apparent, {{but it was}} not until ukiyozōshi that Japanese prose literature approached true realism. Ukiyozōshi is markedly less sentimental and reveals a <b>more</b> objective and <b>cynical</b> perspective. For example, many of Saikaku's stories end tragically and are written in a detached, ironic tone.|$|R
5000|$|Critically, The A.V. Club {{called the}} song [...] "a modern-day 'Conjunction Junction'", writing: [...] "The song {{combines}} cheeky grammar lessons with a lamentation for society's diminished writing skills." [...] CNN {{made a similar}} comparison, believing the song [...] "could follow in the grand tradition of Schoolhouse Rock!". Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "The schoolhouse R&B of 'Word Crimes' is clever enough {{to win over the}} harshest critics of Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines.'" [...] ABC News characterized the parody as [...] "spot-on". Billboard called the song the album's best, writing that [...] "a <b>more</b> satirical, <b>cynical</b> parodist could have taken this in a million super-searing directions, but Al isn't interested in commenting on Thicke's alleged misogyny." ...|$|R
500|$|Stanley {{praises the}} series saying [...] "It's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge-worthy. It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy {{find it hard to}} accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable that so many of the petty, shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E
500|$|Hwang {{was given}} a free hand with dialogue; he {{was not allowed to}} change lyrics. [...] Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals, and the {{producers}} hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the new script, [...] "really a new musical which has a pre-existing score." [...] Only the character names, the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the relationships were retained, but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit of both Lee's novel and the musical's original concept of old-world and older generation values struggling with new-world temptations and the desires of the younger generation. [...] This concept is reflected in the struggle for survival of Wang's Chinese opera company, as it competes with the more modern, Americanized night club run by Ta. [...] The role of Mei-li (as spelled in the revision) was expanded. [...] The character of Madam Liang was changed [...] "from the wise-owl aunt" [...] to a [...] "savvy career woman" [...] in show business. [...] Chinatown is portrayed as a more gritty and difficult place for new immigrants, and the pursuit of material success is given a <b>more</b> <b>cynical</b> face, especially in Act II. [...] The song [...] "The Other Generation" [...] was deleted; [...] "My Best Love", which had been cut in tryouts in 1958, was restored in its place, and [...] "The Next Time It Happens" [...] was imported from Pipe Dream. [...] New orchestrations were by Don Sebesky and music director David Chase. [...] According to The New York Times, Hwang [...] "has reshaped the story to elucidate two of his own abiding thematic interests: the idea of the theater as a prism for society and the generational clashes of diversely assimilated immigrants." ...|$|E
50|$|Elliot and Beverly Mantle are {{identical}} twins and gynecologists who jointly operate {{a highly successful}} clinical practice in Toronto that specializes {{in the treatment of}} female fertility problems.

2500|$|... "In the {{intervening}} years it had become increasingly clear that the tragedy of a Scottsboro lies, not in the bitterly cruel injustice which it works upon its immediate victims, but also, and perhaps even <b>more,</b> in the <b>cynical</b> use of human misery by Communists in propagandizing Communism, and in the complacency with which a democratic government views the basic evils from which such a case arises.

50|$|The film is only {{loosely based}} on Finney's novel, which is {{essentially}} a series of loosely connected vignettes centered on the circus's visit, without the overarching plotline of Stark's scheming and redemption. The novel is also far <b>more</b> biting and <b>cynical</b> in its depiction of average Americans' inability to accept magic and wonder into their lives; this attitude climaxes in the Woldercan sequence as originally staged, which ends with the townsfolk being physically scattered to the winds.|$|R
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is <b>more</b> <b>cynical,</b> more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E

[...] Denby wrote that Fonda [...] "gives an amazingly fierce performance" [...] and that Crowe [...] "gives a fascinating, self-amused performance", saying [...] "Crowe is an acting genius." [...] Denby said [...] "this is by far [...] most {{sustained}} and evocative work." [...] Denby wrote that [...] "much of this Western is tense and intricately wrought." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Do {{you like}} Huey Lewis & The News? Their early work {{was a little}} too 'new-wave' for my taste, but when 'Sports' came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - both commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been {{compared}} to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far <b>more</b> bitter, <b>cynical</b> sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this, 'Fore', their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip to Be Square', a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics - but they should! Because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself!" ...|$|R
