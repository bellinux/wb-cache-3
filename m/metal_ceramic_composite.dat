30|$|At present, the SRBA {{is divided}} into 3 main {{categories}} according to the material of its protection layers: hard, half hard and soft (Ding et al. 2011). Hard SRBA is {{the first version of}} the SRBA, of which the protection layer is made from rigid materials (i.e. <b>metal,</b> <b>ceramic,</b> <b>composite</b> plate). Although excellent protection performance was presented, hard SRBA has huge limitations on the flexible action and wearing comfort (Decker et al. 2007). Half hard SRBA contains both metal layer of metal wires (i.e. metal ring mesh) or metal cords (i.e. titanium foil) and textile layer, with improved flexibility (Bourgois et al. 2001; Decker et al. 2007). The core layer of soft SRBA is the high performance fiber fabric such as ultrahigh molecular modulus polyethylene (UHWMPE), aramids, polybenzoxazole, and polyamide (Flambard and Polo 2004; Lin et al. 2011), which has become the focus of the protection products research (Ding et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of at-home and in-office bleaching on the shear bond strength (SBS) of <b>metal,</b> <b>ceramic,</b> and <b>composite</b> orthodontic brackets and to compare their SBSs. Subjects and Methods: A total of 96 human lower premolar teeth were used for this study. Six teeth were used for scanning electron microscopic study while the remaining ninety were divided into three equal groups. Each group was further subdivided into three subgroups with ten samples each. Three protocols were used. In the at-home bleaching group (n = 30), opalescence non-PF (potassium nitrate and fluoride) bleaching agent (10 % carbamide peroxide) was applied onto the teeth daily for 14 days and left for 8 h each day. Teeth in the in-office group (n = 30) were treated twice in consecutive days with Opalescence boost PF (40 % hydrogen peroxide). After bleaching, the specimens were stored in distilled water for 1 day before bonding. SBS testing was performed on all teeth using Instron universal testing machine. Results: Analysis of variance indicated a significant difference (P < 0. 005) among the groups. Maximum SBS was shown by ceramic brackets in control group (Ib) and minimum was shown by composite brackets of in-office bleached group (IIIc). Conclusions: The results showed that at-home bleaching {{did not affect the}} SBS significantly whereas in-office bleaching reduced SBS of <b>metal,</b> <b>ceramic,</b> and <b>composite</b> brackets significantly.

The most {{promising}} methods for high purity hydrogen production are membranes separation such as polymer, <b>metal,</b> <b>ceramic</b> and <b>composites.</b> It {{is well known}} that Pd and Pd-alloys membranes have excellent properties for hydrogen separation. However, it has hydrogen embrittlement and high cost for practical applications. Therefore, most scientists have studied new materials instead of Pd and Pd-alloys.

40|$|Abstract [...] The current {{analysis}} {{presents a}} model for cleavage fracture {{in the presence of}} dislocation plasticity. We build on a framework developed in an earlier paper [Lipkin et al., Acta mater. 44, 1287 (1996) ], wherein an elastic ore is embedded about he crack tip in a plastically deforming medium. This model provides a mechanism by which cleavage-type crack growth could proceed concomitantly with significant plastic dissipation. The present model is amended to account for the large strain gradients in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip. Such gradients are thought o lead to extensive local hardening. A simple, continuum-based model is used to identify a characteristic length scale ahead of the crack tip, within which the material cannot plastically deform subject o the crack-tip stress field. An expression is derived for the crack-tip shielding afforded by the plasticity prior to initiation of fracture. The strong dependence of toughness on. the ideal work of fracture indicates a possible mechanism for such varied phenomena as segregation-induced embrittlement, ductile-to-brittle ransition, stress corrosion cracking and constrained fracture in <b>metal</b> [...] <b>ceramic</b> <b>composites.</b> Copyright © 1996 Acta Metallurgica Inc. 1...|$|R

In this thesis we will present the demands and solutions for ultra-precision metrology in the manufacturing of lithography masks for the TV-display industry. The extreme challenge {{that needs to be}} overcome is a measurement uncertainty of 10 nm on an absolute scale of more that 2 meters in X and Y. Materials such as <b>metal,</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composites,</b> quartz or glass are highly affected by the surrounding temperature when tolerances are specified at nanometer levels. Also the fact that the refractive index of air in the interferometers measuring absolute distances is affected by temperature, pressure, humidity and CO 2 contents makes the reference measurements really challenging. This {{goes hand in hand with}} the ability of how to design a mask writer, a pattern generator with a performance good enough for writing masks for the display industry with sub-micron accuracy over areas of square meters.  As in many other areas in the industry high quality metrology is the key for success in developing high accuracy production tools. The aim of this thesis is therefore to discuss the metrology requirements of mask making for display screens. Defects that cause stripes in the image of a display, the so called “Mura” effect, are extremely difficult to measure as they are caused by spatially systematic errors in the mask writing process in the range of 10 - 20 nm. These errors may spatially extend in several hundreds of mm and are superposed by random noise with significantly higher amplitude compared to the 10 - 20 nm.  A novel method for measuring chromium patterns on glass substrates will also be presented in this thesis. This method will be compared to methods based on CCD and CMOS images. Different methods have been implementedin the Micronic MMS 1500 large area measuring machine, which is the metrology tool used by the mask industry, for verifying the masks made by the Micronic mask writers.

Their response to heat treatment in air has been investigated, {{in terms of both}} oxidation kinetics and tensile properties. This has been correlated with measured fracture energies of composite containing these fibres, after similar heat treatments. As received, 304 fibres exhibit greater ductility and work of deformation than 310 fibres. However, severe heat treatments (up to 1170 uC) cause 304 fibres to become oxidised and embrittled, whereas 310 fibres retain good strength and ductility. Composites subjected to these heat treatments become embrittled when they contain 304 fibres, but retain their toughness when reinforced with 310 fibres. These data are consistent with predictions from a previously published model of the fracture process, based on energy absorption being dominated by fibre pullout and/or fibre plasticity...|$|R
