With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the sacred (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the beliefs and practices (which create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the moral community (a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy).

O'Brien {{tried to focus on}} the choruses, which he felt were {{the best part of the}} AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the [...] "hooky, melodic side" [...] of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had [...] "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed [...] "towards The Razors Edge era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." [...] O'Brien made suggestions about the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on [...] "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for [...] "soul crooning" [...] as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day. The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, [...] "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added [...] "n AC/DC's music, the song is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> individual's bit in it".|$|E

2500|$|The {{arguments}} against this theory are manifold: For one, {{there is no}} hint of Verethragna (or any other Zoroastrian divinity) having dragon-slaying functions. In the Avesta, it is the hero warrior-priest Thraetaona who battles the serpent Aži Dahāka (which, for the virtue of 'Azi' being cognate with Sanskrit 'Ahi', snake, is – by proponents of the theory - associated with Vedic Vritra). Moreover, in the Vedas, the epithet 'hero' (sura) is itself almost exclusively reserved for Indra, while in the Avesta it is applied to Thraetaona and other non-divine figures. The term [...] "victorious" [...] too is not restricted to Verethragna, but is also a property {{of a number of}} other figures, both divine and mortal, including Thraetaona. Then, while in the Vedas it is Indra who discovers Soma, in the Avesta it is humans who first press Haoma and Thraetaona is attributed with being the [...] "inventor of medicine". In the Vedas, Indra strikes with vajra, but in the Avesta vazra is Mithra's weapon. Finally, and from a point of basic doctrine far <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> of the other arguments, Indra is a daeva, precisely that class of divinity that Zoroaster exhorts his followers to reject. Indeed, Indra is explicitly named as one of the six evil demons in Vendidad 10.9 – directly opposing the Amesha Spenta Asha Vahishta, with whom Verethragna is associated.|$|E
