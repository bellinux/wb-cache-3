5000|$|The MLR {{was first}} {{recognized}} when researchers mixed leukocytes from two unrelated donors in culture. [...] After several days, lymphocytes underwent blast transformation, DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation {{in response to}} the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigen</b> (MHC Class I and II) differences between the two cell populations designated as Responder and Stimulator cells. Responder cells proliferated without previous exposure to Stimulator MHC antigens. This response became quantifiable when incorporating radioactivity, 3H thymidine or 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU), into the mixed cell suspension. This cellular response to the histocompatibility antigens that occurs in the MLR is also involved in cell-mediated immune responses within an individual and offered an in vitro correlate of cellular immune function. [...] Standard MLR assays were performed in humans and most other animal species.|$|E

The steady-state levels of beta 2 -microglobulin and H- 2 mRNA from F 9 -derived teratocarcinoma stem and differentiated cells were examined by blot hybridization using cloned DNA probes specific for these mRNAs. No H- 2 - or beta 2 -microglobulin-specific RNA was detected in F 9 teratocarcinoma stem cells (clone 12 - 1); thus, F 9 teratocarcinoma stem cells (clone 12 - 1) contain {{no more than}} 1 / 10 the H- 2 and beta 2 -microglobulin mRNAs of the differentiated daughter cells (clone 12 - 1 a). We suggest that this regulation of <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigen</b> expression is due to transcriptional control of the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigen</b> genes, H- 2 and beta 2 -microglobulin.

Because the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> are important determinants of the immune response in various tissues, we have investigated their expression on the pancreatic islet cells. Human, mouse, or rat islets of Langerhans, as well as lymphocytes or other differentiated cells, were biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids, lysed in detergent, and immunoprecipitated with several antisera specific for <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> antigenic groups.

Binding of H- 2 antibodies to islet cells was also confirmed by a radioligand assay using 125 I-labeled protein A and by indirect immunofluorescence. Analyses in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter revealed that greater than 95 % of the cells in the beta-cell-rich fraction were fluorescent, providing further evidence that the pancreatic beta cells express the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens.</b> Monoclonal antibodies or mouse alloantisera against HLA-DR or Ia antigens did not react with labeled pancreatic islet cell proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{obstacle to}} successful clinical transplantation {{of a human}} organ, immunological rejection, {{seems to be a}} result of inadequacies in two areas: (a) the inability to induce tolerance to tissue antigens; and (b) the inability of present donor-recipient matching schemes to differentiate <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> from other cell-associated antigens.

40|$|Human HepG 2 {{hepatoma}} cells {{express a}} high number of insulin receptors. Growing cells exhibit 70 % of their insulin receptors on the plasma membrane. Moreover, cell-surface insulin receptors form molecular complexes with class I <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens,</b> as determined by co-immunoprecipitation of the receptors by anti-class I monoclonal antibodies. On exposure to saturating concentrations of insulin, the hormone is rapidly internalized into a Pronase-resistant compartment. Internalization of insulin is accompanied by a rapid (t 1 / 2 = 2 - 3 min) redistribution of insulin receptors from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment. On removal of insulin from the medium, functional receptors recycle back to the plasma membrane, where they can bind insulin again. With chronic exposure of HepG 2 cells to insulin, the initial redistribution of receptors is followed by a slow (t 1 / 2 = 9 h) down-regulation of the receptors. Finally, notwithstanding their interaction at the cell surface, insulin receptors and class I <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> are internalized at different rates and with independent regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between susceptibility to disease and {{products of the}} MHC {{has been one of}} the first observations signaling the involvement of MHC products in immune recognition (1 - 5). This linkage has become better understood since the discovery that T cells recognize antigens only in association with major transplantation antigens and that they recognize foreign antigen fragments that are noncovalently bound to <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> (6 - 10). The pathophysiology ofthe linkage between <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> and disease is more complex, however, and usually not readily reduced to MHC-dependent immune responsiveness, because the initiating antigens or agent are not known (11, 12). It is interesting that many diseases that exhibit MHC association of susceptibility are immunologically mediated (1 - 4, 11), some examples being ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's disease (2 - 4, 13, 14), andjuvenile diabetes.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have studied}} the role of <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> on cell {{cooperation}} in the immune response of the chicken. In the 1970 's, shortly after the initial discoveries in the mouse, we demonstrated that the T cell-B cell interaction is <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) -dependent in the chicken and requires at least one haplotype identity between the collaborating cells. Later, by using MHC-congenic and MHC-recombinant lines, we demonstrated that the T-B cell interaction in antibody response is MHC-restricted, and more precisely, Class II MHC-antigen-restricted. Furthermore, we proved that T-B cell cooperation in splenic germinal center formation is likewise class II MHC antigen-restricted. Recently, we have focused our studies on MHC antigen identity requirements during antigen presentation by macrophages to T cells. In these studies, Class II antigens were found to serve as restriction elements in antigen recognition by T cells. Cytotoxic T cells of the chicken {{have been shown to}} be MHC-restricted in their function. Whether Class I or Class II MHC antigens serve as restriction molecules has not yet been determined.
