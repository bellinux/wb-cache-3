50|$|Newton, an English {{mathematician}} and physicist, was {{the seminal}} {{figure in the}} scientific revolution.

Newton, for example, showed that the tides were caused by the gravitational pull of the moon. Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.

50|$|As {{hyperinflation}} accelerated, {{the value}} of the Zimbabwe dollar declined fast against other currencies, yet official exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe were infrequently updated; this made it impossible to tell from an official source how much the Zimbabwe dollar was really worth against other currencies on a particular day, which in turn disrupted international business transactions involving Zimbabwe dollars. Staff from WM/Reuters devised an indirect <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> that was termed the Old Mutual Implied Rate (OMIR). This took the daily price of shares in the insurance company Old Mutual that traded in the London and Harare stock markets and derived from it a notional daily exchange rate between the Zimbabwe dollar and the pound. Shares had much less strict capital controls than through the Zimbabwe banking system, so the shares were used as a vehicle for moving capital between currencies by buying stock in either London or Harare and then selling in the other location.|$|E
5000|$|To {{read the}} volume accurately, the {{observation}} {{must be at}} an eye level and read {{at the bottom of}} a meniscus of the liquid level. For example, in the picture on the bottom of the page, a 100mL graduated cylinder was used to measure the liquid. The cylinder contains 60mL liquid volume.The main reason as to why the reading of the volume is done via meniscus is due to the nature of the liquid in a closed surrounded space. By nature, liquid in the cylinder would be attracted to the wall around it through molecular forces. This forces the liquid surface to develop either a [...] or [...] shape, depending on the type of the liquid in the cylinder. Reading the liquid at the bottom part of a [...] or the top part of the [...] liquid is equivalent to reading the liquid at its meniscus. [...] From the picture, the level of the liquid will be read at the bottom of the meniscus, which is the concave. The most accurate of the reading that could be done here is reduced down to 1 mL due to the given <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> on the cylinder. From this, the derived error would be one tenth of the least figure. For instance, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 36.5 mL. The error, give or take 0.1 mL, must be included too. Therefore, the more precise value equates to 36.5 [...] 0.1; 36.4 or 36.6 mL. Therefore, there are 3 significant figures can be read from the given graduated cylinder picture. Another example, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 40.0 mL. The precise value would be 40.0 [...] 0.1; 40.1 or 39.9 mL.|$|E

5000|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of {{drive systems}} usually {{result in a}} significant fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause more or less severe perturbation of the electromagnetic flux and thus additional oscillations of the electric currents in the motor windings. Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also characterized by additional variable in time components which induce torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical vibrations of currents in the motor windings. Such a coupling is often complicated in character and thus computationally troublesome. Because of this reason, till present majority of authors used to simplify the matter regarding mechanical vibrations of drive systems and electric current vibrations in the motor windings as mutually uncoupled. Then, the mechanical engineers applied the electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as ‘a priori‘ assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, e.g. in paper [...] usually basing on numerous experimental measurements carried out for the given electric motor dynamic behaviours. For this purpose, by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> results, proper approximate formulas have been developed, which describe respective electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor,. However, the electricians thoroughly modelled electric current flows in the electric motor windings, but they usually reduced the mechanical drive system to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies, as e.g. in [...] In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but very often they can lead to remarkable inaccuracies, since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g. their mass distribution, torsional flexibility and damping effects, are being neglected. Thus, an influence of drive system vibratory behaviour on the electric machine rotor angular speed fluctuation, {{and in this way}} on the electric current oscillations in the rotor and stator windings, can not be investigated with a satisfactory precision.|$|E
