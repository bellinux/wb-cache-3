5000|$|Civil {{rights activists}} became {{increasingly}} combative in the 1963 to 1964 period, owing to {{events such as}} the thwarting of the Albany campaign, police repression and Ku Klux Klan terrorism in Birmingham, and the assassination of Medgar Evers. Mississippi NAACP Field Director Charles Evers-Medgar Evers' brother-told a public NAACP conference on February 15, 1964, that [...] "non-violence won't work in Mississippi…we made up our minds…that if a white man shoots at a Negro in Mississippi, we will shoot back." [...] The repression of sit-ins in Jacksonville, Florida provoked a riot that saw black youth throwing Molotov cocktails at police on March 24, 1964. Malcolm X gave extensive speeches in this period warning that such militant activity would escalate further if African-Americans' rights were not fully recognized. In his landmark April 1964 speech [...] "The Ballot or the Bullet", Malcolm presented an ultimatum to white America: [...] "There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this <b>month,</b> <b>hand</b> grenades next month, and something else next month. It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets." ...|$|E
40|$|Background The use of {{vascular}} access devices (VADs) may put {{patients at}} risk for bloodstream infections. Despite infection control prevention methods used in our neonatal unit, mean catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) rates are quite high. One contributing factor for these high infection rates may be the skin antiseptic preparation procedure undertaken prior to intravenous line insertion. Objectives We aimed to reduce CRBRBSI rates by changing to octenidine hydrochloride antiseptic solutions for skin preparation in the neonatal unit at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Methods Antiseptics for skin preparation were changed from povidone-iodine or alcohol to octenidine hydrochloride from September to November 2010. Bloodstream infection rates and hand hygiene compliance were recorded and compared {{before and during the}} study. Results The mean CRBRBSI rate in the neonatal unit before changing the skin antiseptic solution (January – August 2010) was 11. 68 ‰ (‰ means per 1000 patient-days). During the study, CRBSI rates decreased significantly to 1. 1 ‰ in the first month, increased to 8. 7 ‰ in the second month, and decreased to 2. 4 ‰ in the third <b>month.</b> <b>Hand</b> hygiene compliance for 1 moment (before aseptic task) fluctuated, reaching 93. 8 % and 100 % before and during the study, respectively. Compliance for the remaining 4 moments of hand hygiene as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), ranged from 33. 0 – 87. 3 % before the study and 8. 0 – 100. 0 % during the study. The most striking decrease in these 4 moments of hand hygiene compliance in the second month was accompanied by a marked increase in CRB SI rate. Conclusions Reduced CRB SI rates cannot be attained by solely changing antiseptic solutions for skin preparation. Maintaining other prevention strategies, such as adhering to the 5 moments of hand hygiene recommended by WHO is also very important...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Little {{is known}} about effects of public use of {{antimicrobial}} handwashing soap. A double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of hands of primary caretakers in 238 inner city households was conducted in which effects of plain or antimicrobial (containing 0. 2 % triclosan) hand-washing soap on bacterial counts of the hands were compared before and after a single wash and before and after handwashing following a year of product use. The randomly assigned product was provided with-out cost to each household during monthly home visits, and compliance with product use was monitored. Households were contacted by tele-phone weekly and with a home visit monthly for 11 <b>months.</b> <b>Hand</b> cul-tures were obtained before and after handwashing at baseline and after 11 months, using a modified glove juice technique. Overall, {{there were no significant}} differences in pre-to-post han-dwashing counts at baseline (p = 0. 41), but by the end of one year, post-wash counts were significantly lower than pre-wash (p = 0. 000) for thos...|$|R

Roger had come up to town and given his opinion, very freely at any rate with regard to Sir Felix. But Roger had immediately returned to Suffolk, and the poor mother in want of assistance and consolation turned naturally to Mr Broune, who came to see her for a few minutes almost every evening. It had now become almost a part of Mr Broune's life to see Lady Carbury once in the day. She told him of the two propositions which Roger had made: first, that she should fix her residence in some second-rate French or German town, and that Sir Felix should be made to go with her; and, secondly, that she should take possession of Carbury manor for six <b>months.</b> <b>'And</b> where would Mr Carbury go?' asked Mr Broune.|$|R
