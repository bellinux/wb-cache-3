40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} patient with acute {{idiopathic}} blind spot enlargement syndrome who had abnormal changes in the outer retinal microstructure limited to areas with reduced responses on multifocal electroretinograms {{as well as to}} the area involving a scotoma. Methods and Results: We report the case of a 44 -year-old man who developed an arcuate scotoma which was associated with a physiological blind spot in the left eye. The ophthalmoscopic, fluorescein angiographic, and full-field electroretinogram findings were normal. The amplitudes of the multifocal electroretinograms were reduced in the area of the scotoma. Optical coherence tomography showed that both the external limiting membrane and the inner and outer segment (IS/OS) line were intact, but that the <b>middle</b> <b>cone</b> outer segment tip line between the IS/OS line and the retinal pigment epithelium was absent in the nasal macular area of the left eye. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the integrity of not only the external limiting membrane and IS/OS line but also the cone outer segment tip line is important for the function of the retina...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{perform a}} {{detailed}} clinical, psychophysical, and molecular assessment {{of members of}} 4 families with an unusual X-linked cone dysfunction syndrome associated with myopia. PARTICIPANTS: Affected and unaffected members of 4 British nonconsanguineous families. METHODS: Subjects underwent both detailed clinical examination and psychophysical testing. After informed consent was obtained, blood samples were taken for DNA extraction, and molecular genetic analysis was performed. The strategy for molecular analysis was to amplify the coding regions of the long and middle wavelength-sensitive cone opsin genes and the upstream locus control region by polymerase chain reaction and to examine these fragments for mutations by sequencing of DNA. RESULTS: The phenotype was almost identical in all 4 families, consisting of moderate to high myopia, astigmatism, moderately reduced acuity, and normal fundi. Electroretinography showed abnormal cone but normal rod responses. Psychophysical testing showed a selective impairment of long cones in combination with well-preserved <b>middle</b> <b>cone</b> and short cone function. There was no {{evidence to suggest that}} the phenotype was progressive. Molecular analysis of the X-linked opsin gene array in the 4 families indicated that affected males have inherited the same X-chromosome from their mother. In 2 families, a long/middle hybrid gene was detected. In a third family, the commonly described deleterious Cys 203 Arg amino acid substitution was identified in both the long and middle opsin genes. In the fourth family, the only abnormality was absence of a middle opsin exon 2; the cause of the protanopia in this family is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The X-linked cone dysfunction syndrome associated with myopia and dichromacy described here has many similarities to Bornholm eye disease, a condition previously mapped to Xq 28. Except for the Cys 203 Arg substitution in one family, no alterations in the opsin gene array were identified that could underlie the cone dysfunction. It is therefore possible that the cone dysfunction may have a genetic origin {{different from that of the}} dichromacy...|$|E

40|$|Uniquely for non-primate mammals, {{three classes}} of cone photoreceptors have been {{previously}} identified by microspectrophotometry in two marsupial species: the polyprotodont fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) and the diprotodont honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). This report {{focuses on the}} genetic basis for these three pigments. Two cone pigments were amplified from retinal cDNA of both species and identified by phylogenetics {{as members of the}} short wavelength-sensitive 1 (SWS 1) and long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin classes. In vitro expression of the two sequences from the fat-tailed dunnart confirmed the peak absorbances at 363  nm in the UV for the SWS 1 pigment and 533  nm for the LWS pigment. No additional expressed cone opsin sequences that could account for the <b>middle</b> wavelength <b>cones</b> could be amplified. However, amplification from the fat-tailed dunnart genomic DNA with RH 1 (rod) opsin primer pairs identified two genes with identical coding regions but sequence differences in introns 2 and 3. Uniquely therefore for a mammal, the fat-tailed dunnart has two copies of an RH 1 opsin gene. This raises the possibility that the <b>middle</b> wavelength <b>cones</b> express a rod rather than a cone pigment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRod-specific {{photoreceptor}} dystrophies {{are complicated}} by the delayed death of genetically normal neighboring cones. In transgenic (Tg) swine with a rod-specific (rhodopsin) gene mutation, cone photoreceptor physiology was normal for months but later declined, consistent with delayed cone cell death. Surprisingly, cone postreceptoral function was markedly abnormal when cone photoreceptor physiology was still normal. The defect was localized to hyperpolarizing cells postsynaptic to the <b>middle</b> wavelength-sensitive <b>cones.</b> Recordings throughout postnatal development indicated a failure of cone circuitry maturation, a novel mechanism of secondary cone abnormality in rod dystrophy. The results have implications for therapy for human retinal dystrophies and raise the possibility that rod afferent activity {{plays a role in}} the postnatal maturation of cone retinal circuitry...|$|R

METHODS: Ganzfeld spectral flashes {{in the presence of}} bright white background illumination were used to elicit S cone ERGs is 15 non-retinopathic diabetics, 16 background retinopathic diabetics, and 16 age matched normal controls. RESULTS: The amplitude of the S cone ERG b-wave was significantly reduced in both non-retinopathic and retinopathic diabetics. An action spectrum based on equal response criteria revealed a selective loss of S cone sensitivity in diabetics. However, no significant difference was observed in the long and <b>middle</b> wavelength sensitive <b>cone</b> ERG. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients showed selective reduction of the S cone ERG, which is thought to reflect changes in the outer retina...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a {{chromatic}} mechanism can drive pupil responses. The aim of this research was to clarify whether a linear or nonlinear chromatic mechanism drives pupillary responses by using test stimuli of various colours that are defined in cone contrast space. The pupil and accommodation responses evoked by these test stimuli were continuously and simultaneously objectively measured by photorefraction. The results with isochromatic and isoluminant stimuli showed that (lie accommodative level remained approximately constant (< 0. 25 D change in mean level) even when the concurrent pupillary response was large (ca. 0. 30 mm). The pupillary response to an isoluminant grating was sustained, delayed by ca. 60 ms) and larger in amplitude than that for a isochromatic uniform stimulus, which supports previous work suggesting that the chromatic mechanism contributes to the pupillary response. In a second experiment, selected chromatic test gratings were used and isoresponse contours in cone contrast space were obtained. The results showed that the isoresponse contour in cone contrast space is well described (r 2 = 0. 99) by a straight line with a positive slope. The results indicate that a [L-M] linear chromatic mechanism, whereby a signal from the long wavelength cone is subtracted from that of the <b>middle</b> wavelength <b>cone</b> and vice versa, drives pupillary responses...|$|R

The ventral retina, contained a large fraction of the first group of ganglion cells. The dorsal retina and the border between these two areas contained relatively more of the latter two groups.

40|$|The {{stability}} and receptivity of three-dimensional supersonic boundary layers over a 7 ° sharp tipped straight cone {{at an angle}} of attack of 4. 2 ° is numerically investigated at a free stream Mach number of 3. 5 and at two high Reynolds numbers, 0. 25 and 0. 50 * 106 /inch. The generation and evolution of stationary crossflow vortices are also investigated by performing simulations with three-dimensional roughness elements located {{on the surface of}} the cone. The flow fields with and without the roughness elements are obtained by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates using the fifth-order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for spatial discretization and using the third-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration. Stability computations reveal that the azimuthal wavenumbers are in the range of m ~ 25 - 50 for the most amplified traveling disturbances and in the range of m ~ 40 - 70 for the stationary disturbances. The N-Factor computations predicted that transition would occur further forward in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>cone</b> compared to the transition fronts near the windward and the leeward planes. The simulations revealed that the crossflow vortices originating from the nose region propagate towards the leeward plane. No perturbations were observed in the lower part of the cone. I...|$|R
40|$|Cyclone {{separators}} {{are commonly}} used for separating dispersed solid particles from gas phase. These devices have simple construction; are relatively inexpensive to fabricate and operate with moderate pressure losses. Therefore, they are widely used in many engineering processes such as dryers, reactors, advanced coal utilization such as pressurized and circulating fluidized bed combustion and particularly for removal of catalyst from gases in petroleum refinery such as in fluid catalytic cracker (FCC). Despite its simple operation, the fluid dynamics and flow structures in a cyclone separator are very complex. The driving force for particle separation in a cyclone separator is the strong swirling turbulent flow. The gas and the solid particles enter through a tangential inlet at {{the upper part of}} the cyclone. The tangential inlet produces a swirling motion of gas, which pushes the particles to the cyclone wall and then both phases swirl down over the cyclone wall. The solid particles leave the cyclone through a duct at the base of the apex of the inverted cone while the gas swirls upward in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>cone</b> and leaves the cyclone from the vortex finder. The swirling motion provides a centrifugal force to the particles while turbulence disperses the particles in the gas phase which increases the possibility of the particle entrainment. Therefore, the performance of a cyclone separator is determined by the turbulence characteristics and particle-particle interaction...|$|R

Sixteen others were kept at ~ 600 m above sea level. They grazed a fenced Mediterranean maquis of ~ 40 ha (group ER). At the end of the experimental period the animals were subjected to a novel object test.

40|$|The ppi 1 colour {{mechanism}} {{was isolated}} {{by means of}} Stile's auxiliary field technique: that it is pi 1 which is isolated is proven by both test and field action spectra. 2. The fundamental mechanisms of human trichromatic colour vision must satisfy Grassman's law of additivity. The hypothesis that pi 1 {{is one of the}} three fundamentals is tested by experiments in which pairs (u 1, u 2) of monochromatic adapting fields are mixed 3. When two fields with wave-lengths in the neighbourhood of its primary mode (mu 1, mu 2 {{less than or equal to}} 500 nm) are combined, pi 1 is field-additive, consistent with the hypothesis that this portion of the pi 1 action spectrum is that of the short-wave-length-sensitive photoreceptors. 4. When a short-wave-length adaptation field (mu 1 less than or equal to 500 nm) is mixed with a longer wave-length field (mu 2 greater than or equal 550 nm) i 1 is strongly non-additive. This result proves that the long-wave-length portion of the pi 1 field spectrum is generated at least in part by a signal originating in the long- or middle-wave-length sensitive cones. 5. Analysis of the additivity failures supports a model of pi 1 in which the signal to be detected is generated in the short-wave-length cones, and must pass serially through two gain stages: the gain in the first stage is controlled by the short-wave-length cones alone; the gain in the second stage is controlled by a signal originating in the <b>middle,</b> or long-wave-length <b>cones,</b> or both...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of L:M cone {{ratio for}} males with normal color vision were derived using the flicker-photometric electroretino-gram (ERG). These were {{obtained}} by best fitting ERG spectral sensitivity functions to a weighted sum of long (L) - and <b>middle</b> (M) -wavelength-sensitive <b>cone</b> spectral absorption curves. Using the ERG, measurements {{can be made with}} extremely high precision, which leaves variation in the wavelength of maximal sensitivity (λmax) of the cone photopigments as the major remaining source of inaccuracy in determining the ratio of cone contributions. Here that source of inaccuracy was largely eliminated through the use of individualized L-cone spectral absorption curves deduced from L-pigment gene sequences. The method was used on 62 normal males {{as part of an effort}} to obtain a true picture of how normal variations in L:M cone ratio are distributed. The percentage of L cones in the average eye was 65 %L [where %L = 100 X L / (L+M) ]. There were huge individual differences ranging from 28 %– 93 %L, corresponding to more than a 30 -fold range in L:M ratio (0. 4 – 13). However, the most extreme values were relatively rare; 80 % of the subjects fell within ± 15 %L of the mean, corresponding to a 4 -fold range in L:M ratio (1 – 4). The method remedies major weaknesses inherent in earlier applications of flicker photometry to estimate cone ratio; however, it continues to depend on the assumption that the average L cone produces a response with an identical amplitude to that of the average M cone. A comparison of the ERG results with the distribution of cone ratios estimated from cone pigment messenger RNA in cadaver eyes indicates that the assumption generally holds true. However, there may be a small number of exceptions in which individuals have normall...|$|R

A new and distinct seed-cone from the Isle of Skye in western Scotland provides the oldest detailed evidence for the ancestral morphology of the phylogenetically contentious family Cupressaceae. Methods: A single isolated cone was prepared as serial sections by the cellulose acetate peel technique, mounted on microscope slides, and viewed and photographed using transmitted light. The three-dimensional structure of the cone was first reconstructed from the serial sections and then refined through imaging with x-ray microtomography. Key results: Scitistrobus duncaanensis, gen. et sp. nov., is a 7. 5 mm-diameter cylindrical seed cone with helically arranged bract-scale complexes in which three scale tips separate from a large bract, each tip bearing one adaxial seed. Seeds are near-inverted, show 180 degrees rotational symmetry, and have a diminutive wing in the major plane.

40|$|Colour vision greatly {{enhances the}} discriminatory and {{cognitive}} capabilities of visual systems and {{is found in}} a great majority of vertebrates and many invertebrates. However, colour coding visual systems are confronted {{with the fact that}} the external stimuli are ambiguous because they are subject to constant variations of luminance and spectral composition. Furthermore, the transmittance of the ocular media, the spectral sensitivity of visual pigments and the ratio of spectral cone types are also variable. This results in a situation where there is no fixed relationship between a stimulus and a colour percept. Colour constancy has been identified as a powerful mechanism to deal with this set of problems; however, it is active only in a short-term time range. Changes covering longer periods of time require additional tuning mechanisms at the photoreceptor level or at postreceptoral stages of chromatic processing. We have used the trichromatic blue acara (Aequidens pulcher, Cichlidae) as a model system and studied retinal morphology and physiology, and visually evoked behaviour after rearing fish for 1 - 2 years under various conditions including near monochromatic lights (spectral deprivation) and two intensities of white light (controls). In general, long-term exposure to long wavelengths light had lesser effects than light of middle and short wavelengths. Within the cone photoreceptors, spectral deprivation did not change the absorption characteristics of the visual pigments. By contrast, the outer segment length of <b>middle</b> and long-wave-sensitive <b>cones</b> was markedly increased in the blue rearing group. Furthermore, in the same group, we observed a loss of 65 % short-wave-sensitive cones after 2 years. These changes may be interpreted as manifestations of compensatory mechanisms aimed at restoring the balance between the chromatic channels. At the horizontal cell level, the connectivity between short-wave-sensitive cones and the H 2 cone horizontal cells, and the spinule dynamics were both affected in the blue light group. This observation rules out the role of spinules as sites of chromatic feedback synapses. The light-evoked responses of H 2 horizontal cells were also sensitive to spectral deprivation showing a shift of the neutral point towards short wavelengths in the blue rearing group. Interestingly, we also found an intensity effect because in the group reared in bright white light the neutral point was more towards longer wavelength than in the dim light group. Like the changes in the cones, the reactions of horizontal cells to spectral deprivation in the long wave domain can be characterised as compensatory. We also tested the spectral sensitivity of the various experimental groups of blue acara in visually evoked behaviour using the optomotor response paradigm. In this case, the changes in the relative spectral sensitivity were more complex and could not be explained by a simple extrapolation of the adaptive and compensatory processes in the outer retina. We conclude that the inner retina, and/or the optic tectum are also involved and react to the changes of the spectral environment. In summary, we have shown a considerable developmental plasticity in the colour vision system of the blue acara, where epigenetic adaptive processes at various levels of the visual system respond to the specific spectral composition of the surroundings and provide a powerful mechanism to ensure functional colour vision in different visual environments. We suggest that processes involving an active fine-tuning of the photoreceptors and the postreceptoral processing of chromatic information during ontogenetic development are a general feature of all colour vision systems. Such mechanisms would establish a functional balance between the various chromatic channels. This appears to be an essential condition for the cognitive systems to extract the relevant and stable information from the unstable and changing stimulus situation...|$|R
