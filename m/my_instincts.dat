500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with <b>my</b> <b>instincts.</b> Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. <b>My</b> <b>instincts</b> were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What if I {{have to give the}} money back?" [...] "I used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{worldwide}} success of [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)", Shakira soon {{began work on}} her ninth studio album Sale el Sol. She decided to experiment with merengue music on the album, saying [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} merengue—that {{was a big part of}} my life, and I was missing it." [...] Merengue is recognized as the national music of the Dominican Republic and the singer travelled to the country to work with Dominican songwriter and record producer El Cata, resulting in songs like [...] "Loca" [...] and [...] "Rabiosa". Shakira said that the recording of the two songs took place in [...] "this tiny studio in the middle of nowhere", and that [...] "it wasn't planned, I was just following <b>my</b> <b>instincts.</b> So this album is very genuine, and very personal as well".|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> tells me," [...] the Professor agreed, [...] "I {{believe that}} we are heading in {{precisely}} the right direction." ...|$|R
60|$|On awakening, I {{discovered}} {{myself in}} the buffet. I have no recollection of going there. <b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> must have guided me there during my sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have trusted <b>my</b> <b>instinct.</b> A {{young man}} having no claim upon {{anybody in the}} world has in an hour of trial {{involving}} his deepest political convictions turned to an illustrious Russian--that's all." ...|$|R
500|$|Spears {{spoke to}} V about the {{sessions}} for Femme Fatale, commenting {{that she had}} been recording the album for two years. On February 8, 2011, Spears tweeted she was in the studio with will.i.am, recording a song for the album. Later, the producer described the collaboration as [...] "a monster. It's mean, pretty, edgy, next level. [...] She's singing fresh over it. It's something that today needs," [...] and unveilead a teaser of the song through a blog message on February 28, 2011. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears commented that she is a fan of The Black Eyed Peas, due the fact that the band [...] "make incredibly catchy, fun pop/dance records and I LOVE will.i.am's style. I have always wanted to do a song with him and would love to work with him more in the future. He is so interesting." [...] will.i.am also praised Spears for the song, saying, [...] "Thank you Britney for collaborating it was a pleasure working with you. Thank you for trusting <b>my</b> <b>instincts.</b> You're a doll."

500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> and intuition." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but----Oh, I'm very confused. You've bullied me {{into such}} a {{defensive}} position that <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> is to deny everything. If you turned on me suddenly and accused me of wearing gloves I'd indignantly deny it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Denham, you're so {{different}} from me. You never give yourself away. I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery. <b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> is to trust the person I'm talking to. That's why I'm always being taken in, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] said he, rising unabashed. [...] "I {{can always}} trust <b>my</b> <b>instinct.</b> I knew the moment I saw {{him that he}} was a {{cavalier}} worth letting blood. Now, sir, your sword and harness, and I am at your service outside!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} (it was the first foreign thing he had done since {{he had been in}} the room), and looked at me in an unpleasantly penetrating manner. <b>My</b> <b>instincts</b> told me that I had better close my eyes. I obeyed <b>my</b> <b>instincts.</b>|$|E
60|$|FAITH. Oh! yes--kind; but-- [She looks up] it's against <b>my</b> <b>instincts.</b>|$|E
60|$|I could {{discover}} {{nothing in}} his face--I could only follow <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> as a woman. Those instincts warned me to accept his explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Watson; I'm set on this. It's a {{crime to}} allow these signs to flaunt {{themselves}} in our prettiest scenes. <b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> revolts at the desecration. Besides, no one else seems to have undertaken the task of exterminating them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eviot," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "let not that beast come nigh me. My soul recoils {{from him in}} fear and disgust: there is {{something}} in his looks alien from my nature, and which I shudder at as at a loathsome snake, from which <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> revolts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thing is}} to go fast if I see the case right. What had I after all but <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> of that on coming back with you, night before last, to pick up Kate? I felt what I felt--I knew in my bones the man had returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|Verrall {{answered}} for her. [...] "No. But things dropped; I saw {{you that}} night, <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> were all awake. I {{knew it was}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mademoiselle," [...] I stammered; for indeed {{her words}} and {{appearance}} had roused all my worst fears, but also all <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> of the sleuth-hound scenting his quarry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. It's {{because of}} your deteriorating influence, I suppose. And yet I trust you, in spite of <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> and--my eyes. I'm seriously put out with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, perhaps that's true, {{but think}} how {{delicate}} my position is, sister. I've a magnificent appetite, and I don't like working. It's {{bad for the}} mind. <b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> tells me that I {{can act as a}} restraining influence on others. They would have been worse, but for me." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{him coming}} from {{the porch of the}} house, a tall slim figure in a hunting shirt--that fitted to perfection--and cavalry boots. His face, his carriage, his quick {{movement}} and stride filled my notion of a hero, and <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> told me he was a gentleman born.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> had not deceived me. It lay in {{readiness}} in the Mall, and, in {{what seemed}} devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp. The red-whiskered man went to the point at once, {{in a manner that}} showed he had been thinking over it all dinner time.|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. I {{must believe}} them. Unless you wish {{me to believe}} my eyes, my heart, <b>my</b> <b>instincts,</b> my imagination, which are all telling me the most monstrous lies about you.|$|E

6000|$|... "You shall hear it," [...] said Keogh. [...] "I said <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> of {{narrative}} were perplexed. Don't you believe it. It's an art I've acquired {{along with many}} other of the graces and sciences." ...|$|E
6000|$|A light, quick step {{ascended the}} stairs--my heart bounded; I started to my feet. It {{was the same}} step which I used to listen for, and love to hear, in my illness. I ran to the door, and opened it. <b>My</b> <b>instinct</b> had not deceived me! it was my sister! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} careful," [...] Seaman promised, [...] "but {{there are certain}} things which I cannot help.

6000|$|Suddenly {{the stillness}} was {{disturbed}} by a faint tap at my door. <b>My</b> <b>instincts</b> and my reason {{told me it}} must be Mariani at last. In an instant I had leapt {{from the bed and}} whispered through the keyhole: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not marry}} in {{obedience}} to <b>my</b> <b>instincts,</b> Nelly; {{and you know}} it. I made a disinterested marriage with a man whom I felt I could respect as my superior. I was convinced then that a grand passion was a folly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{the dream}} {{of my life to}} retire, young man. You may not believe me, but <b>my</b> <b>instincts</b> are {{thoroughly}} domestic. When I have the leisure to weave day-dreams, they centre around a cosy little home with a nice porch and stationary washtubs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Dear, dear me,' I kept on saying {{under my}} breath, 'he {{is doing it}} all wrong.

6000|$|We {{arrived in}} Liverpool {{an hour ago}} very tired, and have halted at this hotel (by the advice of misguided friends)--and if <b>my</b> <b>instinct</b> and {{experience}} are worth anything, {{it is the very}} worst hotel on earth, without any exception.

60|$|All <b>my</b> unspoken <b>instincts,</b> <b>my</b> vague suspicions, {{suddenly}} {{took shape}} and centred upon the naturalist.
