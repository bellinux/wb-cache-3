40|$|The use of noninvasive genetic {{sampling}} (NGS) for surveying wild populations {{is increasing}} rapidly. Currently, {{only a limited}} number of studies have evaluated potential biases associated with NGS. This paper evaluates the potential errors associated with analysing <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> drawn from multiple animals. Most NGS studies assume that <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> will be identified and removed during the genotyping process. We evaluated this assumption by creating 128 <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> of extracted DNA from brown bear (Ursus arctos) hair <b>samples.</b> These <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> were genotyped and screened for errors at six microsatellite loci according to protocols consistent with those used in other NGS studies. Five <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> produced acceptable genotypes after the first screening. However, all <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> produced multiple alleles at one or more loci, amplified as only one of the source samples, or yielded inconsistent electropherograms by the final stage of the error-checking process. These processes could potentially reduce the number of individuals observed in NGS studies, but errors should be conservative within demographic estimates. Researchers should be aware of the potential for <b>mixed</b> <b>samples</b> and carefully design gel analysis criteria and error checking protocols to detect <b>mixed</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>sampling</b> {{frequencies}} and temporal aggregation on standard tests for cointegration. We find that the effects of aggregation {{on the size of the}} tests may be severe. Matching sampling schemes of all series generally reduces size, and the nominal size is obtained when all series are skip sampled in the same way. When matching all schemes is not feasible, but when some high-frequency data are available, we show how to use mixed-frequency models to improve the size distortion of the tests. We test stock prices and dividends for cointegration as an empirical demonstration.

40|$|Nowadays network {{bandwidth}} is increasing continuously for end-users and network providers. Network monitoring tools {{have to be}} able to support these high-speed networks, processing a high number of packets per second. For this reason, network monitoring tools have to be improved using software or hardware techniques. In this paper we use sampling techniques, as a software technique that can provide the capacity of monitoring networks with high bandwidth, keeping a low-cost hardware platform. A new technique called <b>mixed</b> <b>sampling</b> is proposed and compared with other techniques proposed in the literature. We focus on time-dependent statistics not studied before with sampling. These statistics will require applying estimation techniques for better results. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

Both the control and entertainment loads are implemented on top of Gigabit Ethernet, each with a dedicated controller/server. The control load has <b>mixed</b> <b>sampling</b> periods.

In a two wagon scenario, fault tolerance at the controller level is studied, and simulation results show that the system can tolerate the failure of 3 controllers. The system is successful in meeting the packet end-to-end delay with zero packet loss in all OPNET simulated scenarios. The maximum permissible entertainment load is determined for the fault tolerant scenarios. </p...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{framework}} {{to construct an}} efficient sensing (measurement) matrix, called mixed adaptive-random (MAR) matrix, is introduced for directly acquiring a compressed image representation. The <b>mixed</b> <b>sampling</b> (sensing) procedure hybridizes adaptive edge measurements extracted from a low-resolution image with uniform random measurements predefined for the high-resolution image to be recovered. The mixed sensing matrix seamlessly captures important information of an image, and meanwhile approximately satisfies the restricted isometry property. To recover the high-resolution image from MAR measurements, the total variation algorithm based on the compressive sensing theory is employed for solving the Lagrangian regularization problem. Both peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity results demonstrate the MAR sensing framework shows much better recovery performance than the completely random sensing one. The work is particularly helpful for high-performance and lost-cost data acquisition. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} publications we {{have proposed}} a hierarchical variability model and verified it with 90 nm test data. This model is now validated with {{a new set of}} 45 nm test chips. A <b>mixed</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme with both sparse and exhaustive measurements is designed to capture both wafer level and chip level variations. Statistical analysis shows that the acrosswafer systematic function can be sufficiently described as parabolic, while the within-die systematic variation is now very small, with no discernible systematic component. Analysis of pattern dependent effects on leakage current shows that systematic pattern-to-pattern LEFF variation is almost eliminated by optical proximity correction (OPC), but stressrelated variation is not. Intentionally introduced gate length offset between two wafers in our dataset provides insight to device parameter variability and sheds additional light on the underlying sources of process variation...|$|E

The values of n in the transport equation {{are found to}} be below 0. 5, showing non-Fickian or pseudo-Fickian transport in the polymers. The dependence of diffusion coefficient on the mixing methods and temperature has also been studied for the unsaturated polyester nanocomposite. The diffusion coefficients in simultaneous <b>mixing</b> <b>samples</b> decrease with an increase in the mixing time in the samples. In case of the sequential <b>mixing</b> <b>samples,</b> the diffusion coefficient increases with an increase in mixing time.
