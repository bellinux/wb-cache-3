5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and <b>mental</b> <b>pain.</b> Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E

She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant, telling Albert that his father felt shame over what he did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would be ashamed of having fought in a war.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone was {{discovered}} in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the <b>mental</b> <b>pain</b> hypothesis, which was postulated from studying patients and which proposes that major depression {{is associated with a}} decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available {{at the time of its}} development, trazodone showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Trazodone was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic antidepressant approved in the US.|$|E

60|$|We {{are seldom}} able to {{discover}} under any ordinary conditions of self-knowledge, how intimately that spiritual part of us, which is undying, can attach to {{itself and its}} operations the poorest objects of that external world around us, which is perishable. In the ravelled skein, the slightest threads are the hardest to follow. In analysing the associations and sympathies which regulate the play of our passions, the simplest and homeliest are the last that we detect. It is only when the shock comes, and the mind recoils before it--when joy is changed into sorrow, or sorrow into joy--that we really discern what trifles in the outer world our noblest mental pleasures, or our severest <b>mental</b> <b>pains,</b> have made part of themselves; atoms which the whirlpool has drawn into its vortex, as greedily and as surely as the largest mass.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hypervigilance {{and fear}} of pain can cause pain {{patients}} to avoid certain activities. Those activities include activities {{that might lead to}} recovery. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether implementation intentions that strengthen the <b>mental</b> connection between <b>pain</b> and a performance goal on a painful finger pressing task can reduce avoidance of a painful task in healthy participants. Method: 75 participants ranging from 17 - 27 years old were randomly assigned to 3 different groups. 1 group formed implementation intentions that strengthened the <b>mental</b> connection between <b>pain</b> and a performance goal, 1 group formed implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a performance goal and 1 group formed goal intentions. The participants had to press a button 5 times per second, which resulted in a painful sensation in the arm of participants. To measure avoidance of the painful task, the time spended on the task and the number of presses were registered. The hypothesis was that implementation intentions that strengthened the <b>mental</b> connection between <b>pain</b> and a performance goal would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance compared implementation intentions that created a connection between a neutral stimulus and a performance goal and compared to goal intentions. Also it was expected that implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a performance goal would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Results: Implementation intentions that strengthened the <b>mental</b> connection between <b>pain</b> and a performance goal led to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions, but not than implementation intentions that created a connection between a neutral stimulus and a performance goal. Implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a performance goal did not lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Discussion: The findings of the current study suggest that implementation intentions that strengthen the <b>mental</b> connection between <b>pain</b> and a performance goal could be a useful instrument in reducing avoidance of painful activities in pain patients...|$|R
