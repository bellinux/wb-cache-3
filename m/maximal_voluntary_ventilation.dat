40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare lung {{function}} between patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome {{and those with}} sequelae of paralytic poliomyelitis (without any signs or symptoms of post-poliomyelitis syndrome), {{as well as between}} patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-nine male participants were assigned to one of three groups: control; poliomyelitis (comprising patients who had had paralytic poliomyelitis but had not developed post-poliomyelitis syndrome); and post-poliomyelitis syndrome. Volunteers underwent {{lung function}} measurements (spirometry and respiratory muscle strength assessment). RESULTS: The results of the spirometric assessment revealed no significant differences among the groups except for an approximately 27 % lower mean <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the post-poliomyelitis syndrome group when compared with the control group (p = 0. 0127).

Hand-held dynamometry is less expensive and more quickly applicable than <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction. Objective. To investigate if hand-held dynamometry is as reliable and valid as <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction in measuring muscle strength in patients with an adult-onset, non-hereditary progressive lower motor neuron syndrome. Design. Two testers performed <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction and hand-held dynamometry measurements in six muscle groups bilaterally in patients with progressive lower motor neuron syndrome to assess reliability and validity of both the methods. Selling. Outpatient units of an academic medical center. Patients. A consecutive sample of 19 patients with non-hereditary progressive lower motor neuron syndrome (median disease duration 32. 5 months, range 10 - 84) was tested. Outcome measures. Comparison between <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> strength contractions as measured by hand-held dynamometry and <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction. Results. Low intra- and interrater variation in all muscle groups were found, intraclass correlation coefficients vary between 0. 86 and 0. 99 for both methods. Both methods correlated well in all muscle groups with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged between 0. 78 and 0. 98. Scatter plots indicated a trend to under-estimate muscle strength above 250 N by hand-held dynamometry as compared with <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction. Conclusions. For longitudinal evaluation of muscle strength in patients with progressive lower motor neuron syndrome (i. e. between 0 and 250 N), muscle strength can be accurate quantified with both hand-held dynamometry and <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction. Hand-held dynamometry has the advantage of being cheap and quickly applicable. However, our results indicate that hand-held dynamometry is less sensitive than <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction in detecting subnormal muscle strength in strong muscle groups (i. e. > 250 N), due to limited strength of the tester.

Average EMG (aEMG) of BB and BR decreased as the joint angle increased both in eccentric and in isometric actions but the decrease in a EMG towards extension was somewhat higher in eccentric actions as compared to isometric.

40|$|Purpose: Ultramarathon running {{offers a}} unique {{possibility}} {{to investigate the}} mechanisms contributing to the limitation of endurance performance. Investigations of locomotor muscle fatigue show that central fatigue is {{a major contributor to}} the loss of strength in the lower limbs after an ultramarathon. In addition, respiratory muscle fatigue is known to limit exercise performance, but only limited data are available on changes in respiratory muscle function after ultramarathon running and it is not known whether the observed impairment is caused by peripheral and/or central fatigue. Methods: In 22 experienced ultra-trail runners, we assessed respiratory muscle strength, i. e., maximal voluntary inspiratory and expiratory pressures, mouth twitch pressure (n = 16), and voluntary activation (n = 16) using cervical magnetic stimulation, lung function, and <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> before and after a 110 -km mountain ultramarathon with 5862 m of positive elevation gain. Results: Both maximal voluntary inspiratory (− 16 % ± 13 %) and expiratory pressures (− 21 % ± 14 %) were significantly reduced after the race. Fatigue of inspiratory muscles likely resulted from substantial peripheral fatigue (reduction in mouth twitch pressure, − 19 % ± 15 %; P < 0. 01), as voluntary activation (− 3 % ± 6 %, P = 0. 09) only tended to be decreased, suggesting negligible or only mild levels of central fatigue. Forced vital capacity remained unchanged, whereas forced expiratory volume in 1 s, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, and <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> were significantly reduced (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Ultraendurance running reduces respiratory muscle strength for inspiratory muscles shown to result from significant peripheral muscle fatigue with only little contribution of central fatigue. This is in contrast to findings in locomotor muscles. Whether this difference between muscle groups results from inherent neuromuscular differences, their specific pattern of loading or other reasons remain to be clarified...|$|E

The regression model presented the highest value of R 2 being observed when <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction of the back muscles was tested with five independent variables (63 %). In this model handgrip strength was the only predictive variable (β = 0. 61, p = 0. 001). Conclusions: The prevalence of chronic low back pain in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus was 26 %. The <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction of the back muscles was 63 % predicted by five variables of interest, however, only the handgrip strength was a statistically significant predictive variable. The <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction of the back muscles presented a linear relation directly proportional to handgrip and inversely proportional to Oswestry Index i. e. stronger back muscles are associated with lower disability scores...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} verified that strength is improved by a training programme consisting of repetitions of <b>maximal</b> isometric <b>voluntary</b> co-contractions without increasing co-activations during contractions against external resistances. Ten participants performed 12 training sessions (four sets of 6 × 4 second maximal isometric co-contraction of the elbow flexor and extensors, 3 {{days a week}} for 4 weeks). Surface electromyograms of triceps and biceps brachii were collected during <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric elbow flexion and extension against a force transducer. <b>Maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric force increased significantly after training, by 13. 8 ± 6. 0 % (extension) and 9. 6 ± 9. 5 % (flexion), but the observed increases in EMG of agonist muscles during <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction were not significant. No significant changes in the levels of co-activation of the elbow flexors and extensors were observed. No significant change was observed for all the parameters in a control group of ten participants. These results indicated that the strength improvements after co-contraction training occur without increases in co-activation level...|$|R
40|$|Blood lactate {{concentrations}} were measured in five {{patients with chronic}} airways obstruction after 10 minutes' sustained <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> (SMVV) with end-tidal carbon dioxide tension kept constant and after a 12 -minute walk. No patient showed a significant rise in blood lactate after SMVV but all showed evidence of low-frequency fatigue of the sternomastoid muscle. After a 12 -minute walk three patients showed a significant rise in blood lactate {{and two of them}} also had evidence of low-frequency fatigue of the sternomastoid muscle. The absence of a rise in blood lactate after SMVV {{may be due to the}} fact that in patients with chronic airways obstruction ventilation is limited by airflow obstruction to a level where only a small muscle mass is used, or where the aerobic capacity of the respiratory muscles is not exceeded...|$|E

Physiol. 86 (2) : 611 – 616, 1999. —In some trained athletes, maximal exercise ventilation {{is believed to}} be constrained by expiratory flow limitation (FL). Using the negative expiratory pressure method, we assessed whether FL was reached during a progressive maximal exercise test in 10 male competition cyclists. The cyclists reached an average maximal O 2 consumption of 72 ml·kg 21 ·min 21 (range: 67 – 82 ml·kg 21 ·min 21) and ventilation of 147 l/min (range: 122 – 180 l/min) (88 % of preexercise <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> in 15 s). In nine subjects, FL was absent at all levels of exercise (i. e., expiratory flow increased with negative expiratory pres-sure over the entire tidal volume range). One subject, the oldest in the group, exhibited FL during peak exercise. The group end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) decreased durin...|$|E

30|$|Plantar flexors were {{selected}} as the target muscles in this experiment because previous studies that reported {{an increase in the}} <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque selected plantar flexors as the target muscles (Fukutani et al. 2012); (Miyamoto et al. 2011). Each participant lay on an isokinetic dynamometer (CON-TREX, CMV AG, Switzerland) with the right knee and hip joints fully extended. The right foot was tightly secured to the dynamometer’s footplate, and the right thigh was fixed to the dynamometer’s bench with a non-elastic strap to minimize unwanted movements. The center of rotation of the footplate and center of the ankle joint were aligned visually. During the twitch and conditioning contractions, the ankle joint angle was set at 0 ° (anatomical position). The joint angular velocity of the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction was set at 30 °/s and 180 °/s (slow and fast conditions, respectively). The range of motion of the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction was set from - 15 ° (dorsiflexion) to 30 ° (plantar flexion) in the fast velocity condition and from - 15 ° to - 5 ° in the slow velocity condition to minimize the difference of the contraction duration between the two velocity conditions. In a preliminary study, we confirmed that peak torque during the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction in each velocity condition was recorded within these ranges of motion. Subjects were instructed to perform the fast and slow <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction as forcibly as possible.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque was found only immediately after the conditioning contraction although the {{increase in}} isometric twitch torque was observed five minutes after conditioning contraction. This difference {{can be explained by}} sensitivity to the potentiation effect of a conditioning contraction (i.e., myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation which is considered to be the primary mechanism of PAP) (Sweeney et al. 1993). Ca 2 + concentration is much higher in the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction (multiple impulses) than in twitch contraction (single impulse). In addition, the extent of increase in torque by conditioning contraction becomes smaller when the Ca 2 + concentration is higher (Persechini et al. 1985). Thus, the increasing effect of the <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque would have diminished faster than that in the isometric twitch torque.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether adding a <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction to developing snowboard and ski cross athletes’ warm-up could reduce start time. A secondary {{aim was to}} assess the appropriateness of start performance as a talent identification tool for junior athletes by determining whether differences in time could be explained by participant age and anthropometry. Twenty sub-elite athletes (male: n =  11, female: n =  9, age: 15. 0  ±  1. 4 years) participated. No differences were found for start time (7. 5  m) between <b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction and standardised (no-maximal voluntary isometric contraction) warm-up or gender (<b>maximal</b> <b>voluntary</b> isometric contraction; males: 1. 36  ±  0. 07  s, females: 1. 41  ±  0. 03  s, no-maximal voluntary isometric contraction; males: 1. 35  ±  0. 01  s, females: 1. 38  ±  0. 10  s, P >  0. 05). A strong relationship between body mass and start time to 7. 5  m (r = − 0. 78, r 2  =  0. 61, P <  0. 05) was observed.
