The ultimate objective is development of intelligent model objects that include modeled object data and behavior description, and human intent filtered knowledge. The proposed model objects are intelligent organizers of information, knowledge, {{and procedures for}} decision assistance. Results facilitate completing present simple data, rule and formula based relating of parameters of modeled objects by an intelligent solution. The paper details application of integrated model object for description of an interrelated group of modeled objects. Description of engineering objects is introduced. Following this, essential <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> modeled objects is shown. Next communication <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in the affect zone <b>of</b> <b>changed</b> objects, is detailed.

40|$|The modern {{business}} environment is characterised by constant economic upheaval and incessant technological {{changes and the}} pace <b>of</b> <b>change</b> has accelerated {{with the emergence of}} the Internet. Consequently the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>change</b> has become a major challenge for almost all organisations. Increasingly researchers have refocused their attention from planned models <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>management</b> to understanding the emergent nature <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> It is now widely acknowledged that one of the major obstacles to managing change is organisational culture. Since cultural concepts have their origins in anthropology, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the contribution which anthropology can make in the study of organisational culture and, by implication, the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>change.</b> This paper recognises some of the inherent weaknesses with existing cultural models and approaches within the literature; most studies assume that culture is static over time; that culture is homogenous (disregarding cultural pluralism) and there is a tendency to represent culture in terms of conceptual dichotomies. In this paper, a theoretical framework originating from anthropology (grid and group cultural theory) is put forward as a more coherent and interpretive research framework for examining organisational culture and the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>change...</b>|$|R

Retailers‚Äô capability to adapt their assortment policy by markets and store formats in front of different product category selling seasons has been assessed.
