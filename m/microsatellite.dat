5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using <b>microsatellite</b> loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using <b>microsatellite</b> markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the <b>microsatellite</b> loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using <b>microsatellite</b> analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA <b>microsatellite</b> analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E

A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of <b>microsatellite</b> markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28.

40|$|Tandem repeats are genomic {{elements}} that are prone to changes in repeat number and are thus often polymorphic. These sequences are found at a high density {{at the start of}} human genes, in the gene’s promoter. Increasing empirical evidence suggests that length variation in these tandem repeats can affect gene regulation. One class of tandem repeats, known as <b>microsatellites,</b> rapidly alter in repeat number. Some of the genetic variation induced by <b>microsatellites</b> is known to result in phenotypic variation. Recently, our group developed a novel method for measuring the evolutionary conservation of <b>microsatellites,</b> and with it we discovered that human <b>microsatellites</b> near transcription start sites are often highly conserved. In this study, we examined the properties of <b>microsatellites</b> found in promoters. We found a high density of <b>microsatellites</b> at the start of genes. We showed that <b>microsatellites</b> are statistically associated with promoters using a wavelet analysis, which allowed us to test for associations on multiple scales and to control for other promoter related elements. Because promoter <b>microsatellites</b> tend to be G/C rich, we hypothesized that G/C rich regulatory elements may drive the association between <b>microsatellites</b> and promoters. Our results indicate that CpG islands, G-quadruplexes (G 4) and untranslated regulatory regions have highly significant associations with <b>microsatellites,</b> but controlling for these elements in the analysis does not remove the association between <b>microsatellites</b> and promoters.

40|$|The {{alarming}} {{development of}} anthelmintic resistance in important gastrointestinal nematode parasites {{of man and}} live-stock is caused by selection for specific genotypes. In order to provide genetic tools to study the nematode populations {{and the consequences of}} anthelmintic treatment, we isolated and sequenced 59 <b>microsatellites</b> of the sheep and goat parasite Haemonchus contortus. These <b>microsatellites</b> consist typically of 2 - 10 tandems CA/GT repeats that are interrupted by sequences of 1 - 10 bp. A predominant cause of the imperfect structure of the <b>microsatellites</b> appeared mutations of G/C bp in the tandem repeat. About 44 % of the <b>microsatellites</b> were associated with the HcREP 1 direct repeat, and it was demonstrated that a generic HcREP 1 primer could be used to amplify HcREP 1 -associated <b>microsatellites.</b> Thirty <b>microsatellites</b> could be typed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of which 27 were polymorphic.

5|$|Based on <b>microsatellite</b> DNA evidence, the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea {{separated}} lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A <b>microsatellite</b> study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (<b>microsatellite)</b> variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E

Clustering, multivariate analyses, and diversity-based statistics are increasingly being applied to infer population structure, but in some instances these methods lack formalization with <b>microsatellites.</b> Migration-specific methods perform well only under nar-row constraints.

Based on analysis of <b>microsatellite</b> DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest genetic distance from the Marwari, and a much closer genetic distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only genetic, but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended at least in part from the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony.

The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds, including the Percheron, Belgian and Clydesdale, in previous <b>microsatellite</b> loci studies. This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study. The high levels of diversity in the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study, which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation. The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other, more popular, breeds.|$|E
