40|$|Vitiligo is an {{acquired}} idiopathic hypomelanotic disorder {{which has an}} unknown aetiology and ultimately affects <b>melanocytes,</b> primarily of the skin. Many patients with vitiligo suffer from psychological distress and therefore {{it is important to}} determine why <b>melanocytes</b> are destroyed. The aim {{of this study was to}} learn more about the basic cellular physiology of normal and vitiligo <b>melanocytes.</b> Morphology, proliferation and pigmentation in normal <b>melanocytes</b> were highly influenced by media additives, bovine pituitary extract (BPE), cholera toxin (CT), foetal calf serum (FCS) and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 acetate (PMA). In the absence of these factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins increased survival, proliferation and pigmentation of normal <b>melanocytes,</b> while ultraviolet irradiation (UVR) increased dendricity and pigmentation in the presence of these factors. Normal and vitiligo <b>melanocytes</b> were morphologically very similar and long-term cultured vitiligo <b>melanocytes</b> had proliferation which was not significantly different to that of normal <b>melanocytes.</b> Constitutive and cytokine-stimulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II were not different between normal and vitiligo <b>melanocytes</b> in vitro. The latter suggested that vitiligo <b>melanocytes</b> do not have an inherent defect in regulation of these adhesion molecules which could lead to their premature interaction with the immune system. a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) has a controversial pigmentary role in man. In normal <b>melanocytes,</b> only under a limited number of media conditions did <b>melanocytes</b> exhibit increased melanogenesis to a-MSH. However a-MSH was found to be particularly effective at opposing the actions of TNF-a-stimulated ICAM- 1 expression in <b>melanocytes.</b> This finding supported an immunomodulatory role for a-MSH in normal <b>melanocytes.</b> Finally a surgical treatment using cultured epithelial autograis (CEA) was used to treat 3 patients with symmetrical (generalised) vitiligo, with mixed results. One patient showed good repigmentation, while the response was less promising in the other-two patients...|$|R
40|$|Mitotic {{figures were}} {{demonstrated}} in the differentiated <b>melanocytes</b> of normal epidermal and nonepidermal tissues without the presence of external stimuli. These dividine <b>melanocytes</b> were present in human and mouse skin, mouse hair, chick feathers, and embryonic chick retinal pigment epithelium. In normal adult human epidermis, dividing <b>melanocytes,</b> though rare, {{were found in the}} nonstimulated areas. L- 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine reaction on the <b>melanocytes</b> during mitosis demonstrated activity of the melanin-forming enzyme, tyrosinase, and ultrastructural studies demonstrated the characteristic melanosomes in variour stages of maturation. Other ultrastructural characteristics of the <b>melanocytes</b> during mitosis, except for the Golgi apparatus, which was smaller and less complex, were similar to those seen in well- differentiated nondividing <b>melanocytes.</b> Autoradiographic studies of thymidine incorporation into mouse skin indicated that 0. 7 % of epidermal <b>melanocytes,</b> when slightly stimulated, are in the S phase. Thus, in vivo differentiation of non-neoplastic <b>melanocytes</b> (to produce pyrosinase and melanosomes) does not preclude their replication by mitotic division...|$|R
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{sometimes}} a preceding viral infection, or skin or eye trauma, the exact underlying initiator of VKH disease remains unknown. However, VKH is attributed to aberrant T-cell-mediated immune response directed against self-antigens found on melanocytes.

25|$|MC1R {{is one of}} the key {{proteins}} {{involved in}} regulating mammalian skin and hair color. It is located on the plasma membrane of specialized cells known as melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin through the process of melanogenesis.

UVB irradiation, {{twice a week}} for 1 or 2 mo, induced brown-black pigmentation on the flanks. A 1 m TBC application twice a week for 1 mo not only prevented the UV-stimulated pigmentation, but also promoted fading of the post-UV tanning. Dopastained split epidermal sheets showed {{a decrease in the}} number of <b>melanocytes</b> to less than one-half during the first month of TBC treatment. <b>Melanocytes</b> were often enlarged or lost their dendrites and both premelanosomes and melanosomes showed ultrastructural changes. However, TBC application on the ears for 1 mo showed neither color change nor a {{decrease in the number of}} <b>melanocytes.</b> There were ultrastrutural changes in <b>melanocytes</b> but the degree of abnormality was much less than those seen in UV-stimulated <b>melanocytes.</b> Continuation of TBC application for 2 month with the UV irradiation on the flanks or the nonirradiated ears caused an increase in the number of <b>melanocytes.</b> These results suggest that the initial effect of TBC may be primarily cytotoxicity to <b>melanocytes</b> and may correlated with their cellular functions. The stimulatory effects of TBC on <b>melanocytes</b> seen during the longer period of times requires further investigation...|$|R

25|$|The {{processing}} of POMC involves glycosylations, acetylations, and extensive proteolytic cleavage at sites shown to contain regions of basic protein sequences. However, the proteases that recognize these cleavage sites are tissue-specific. In some tissues, including the hypothalamus, placenta, and epithelium, all cleavage sites may be used, {{giving rise to}} peptides with roles in pain and energy homeostasis, <b>melanocyte</b> stimulation, and immune modulation. These include several distinct melanotropins, lipotropins, and endorphins that are contained within the adrenocorticotrophin and β-lipotropin peptides.|$|E
25|$|Human {{skin color}} fades with age. Humans {{over the age}} of thirty {{experience}} a decrease in melanin-producing cells by about 10 to 20 percent per decade as <b>melanocyte</b> stem cells gradually die. The skin of face and hands has about twice the amount of pigment cells as unexposed areas of the body, as chronic exposure to the sun continues to stimulate melanocytes. The blotchy appearance of skin color in the face and hands of older people is due to the uneven distribution of pigment cells and to changes in the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes.|$|E
25|$|Melanin is {{produced}} by cells called melanocytes in a process called melanogenesis. Melanin is made within small membrane–bound packages called melanosomes. As they become full of melanin, they move into the slender arms of melanocytes, from where they are transferred to the keratinocytes. Under normal conditions, melanosomes cover {{the upper part of}} the keratinocytes and protect them from genetic damage. One <b>melanocyte</b> supplies melanin to thirty-six keratinocytes according to signals from the keratinocytes. They also regulate melanin production and replication of melanocytes. People have different skin colors mainly because their melanocytes produce different amount and kinds of melanin.|$|E

40|$|Melanoma is a {{malignant}} tumour of <b>melanocytes,</b> which can {{spread to other}} organs of the body resulting in severe and/or lethal malignancies. <b>Melanocytes</b> are pigment producing cells found in deep layer of the epidermis and are originated from <b>melanocytes</b> stem cells through a cellular process called melanogenesis. Several genes, epigenetic and micro-environmental factors {{are involved in this}} process via the regulation and maintenance of the balance between <b>melanocytes</b> stem cells proliferation and their differentiation into <b>melanocytes.</b> Dysregulation of this balance through gain or loss of function of key genes implicated in the control and regulation of cell cycle progression and/or differentiation results in melanoma initiation and progression. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview about the origin of <b>melanocytes,</b> the oncogenic events involved in <b>melanocytes</b> stem cells transformation and the mechanisms implicated in the perpetuation of melanom{{a malignant}} phenotype...|$|R
25|$|Pharmacotherapy {{research}} for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma offers new treatment possibilities. In {{addition to the}} advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in melanin synthesis involves the transcription factor MITF. The MITF gene is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a fairly straightforward pathway. UV radiation causes increased expression of transcription factor p53 in keratinocytes, and p53 causes these cells to produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which binds to melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates adenylate cyclases, which produce cAMP, which activates CREB, which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include p16 (a CDK inhibitor) and Bcl2, a gene essential to <b>melanocyte</b> survival. It {{is often difficult to}} design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.|$|E

40|$|Using split {{epidermal}} sheets {{treated with}} colchicine, a quantitative study {{was carried out}} on hairless mouse epidermal <b>melanocytes</b> and those in mitosis, during 14 daily exposures to UV. It was demonstrated that the mitotic figures were first noted after 3 days of irradiation and their incidence varied with the duration of UV treatment; the number of cells in arrested mitosis during the 3 hour period was 0. 2 – 0. 4, 0. 6 – 0. 7 and 1. 0 – 1. 3 per cent of dopa-positive <b>melanocytes,</b> respectively, after 3, 5 and 7 to 14 days of exposure. Comparison of those values {{and the rate of}} population increase of <b>melanocytes</b> indicates that the numerical increase in <b>melanocytes</b> during the first 5 days is attributable largely to a mechanism other than the division of <b>melanocytes.</b> In addition, {{it is likely that the}} population increase between the 5 th to 14 th days is due, to a considerable extent, to a similar process.

40|$|Located in the basal {{epidermis}} {{and hair}} follicles, <b>melanocytes</b> of the integument {{are responsible for}} its coloration through production of melanin pigments. Melanin is produced in lysosomal-like organelles called melanosomes. In humans, this skin pigmentation acts as an ultraviolet radiation filter. Abnormalities in the division of <b>melanocytes</b> are quite common, with potentially oncogenic growth usually followed by cell senescence producing benign naevi (moles), or occasionally melanoma. Therefore, <b>melanocytes</b> are a useful model for studying melanoma, as well as pigmentation and organelle transport and the diseases affecting these mechanisms. This chapter focuses on the isolation, culture, and transfection of human and murine <b>melanocytes.</b> The first basic protocol describes the primary culture of <b>melanocytes</b> from human skin {{and the maintenance of}} growing cultures.

Epidermal melanoblasts dramatically increased in number in MDMDF consisting of MDM supplemented with dibutyryl adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF). Epidermal <b>melanocytes</b> increased in number in MDMD consisting of MDM supplemented with DBcAMP. On the other hand, epidermal <b>melanocytes</b> were induced to differentiate in MDMM consisting of MDM supplemented with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Pure cultured primary melanoblasts or <b>melanocytes</b> in MDMDF or MDMD were further cultured with MDMDF or MDMD supplemented with endothelin (ET) - 1, - 2, or - 3 from 14 d. A dramatic {{increase in the number of}} melanoblasts or <b>melanocytes</b> was observed after 7 d; however, no increase in the number of melanoblasts or <b>melanocytes</b> was observed in the absence of ET- 1, - 2, or - 3. The increase in the number of melanoblasts or <b>melanocytes</b> was comparable with that of melanoblasts or <b>melanocytes</b> cocultured with secondary keratinocytes in MDMDF or MDMD. Also, pure cultured primary melanoblasts in MDM were further cultured with MDMM supplemented with ET- 1, - 2, or - 3 from 14 d.

40|$|Complement {{regulatory}} molecules, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor (DAF) and CD 59, protect body {{cells from}} autologous complement. They have wide tissue distribution {{but nothing is}} known about the expression of these molecules on human <b>melanocytes.</b> Since <b>melanocytes</b> are lysed in the lesional skin of patients with a depigmentary disorder vitiligo, it is important to compare the protection offered by complement regulatory molecules to <b>melanocytes</b> present in normal and vitiligo epidermis, against autologous complement. From this point of view, we investigated the differential expression of MCP, DAF and CD 59 on normal cultured human <b>melanocytes</b> and assessed their individual contribution in the protection of these cells against complement-mediated damage. Flow cytometric analysis showed that MCP and DAF but not CD 59 were expressed on cultured <b>melanocytes.</b> When heat inactivated sera of patients with vitiligo were used as a source of anti-melanocyte antibody to sensitize <b>melanocytes,</b> and guinea pig serum (GpS) or normal human serum (NHS) as a source of complement, GpS was found to be more effective in causing the lysis of <b>melanocytes</b> than NHS. When <b>melanocytes</b> were sensitized with autoantibody as well as F(ab') 2 fragment of either anti-MCP or anti-DAF and subsequently incubated with NHS or GpS, both antibody fragments increased the killing of <b>melanocytes</b> by NHS as well as by GpS.

Results using this panel of antibodies on frozen skin sections suggest that <b>melanocytes</b> are indeed absent in the lesions. However, in epidermal split-skin preparations, residual staining was occasionally observed. To determine whether the staining obtained was due to degenerated <b>melanocytes,</b> confocal laser scanning microscopy was used.

40|$|The {{dominant}} skin pigment melanin {{is believed}} to protect human skin against several harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.

Unpigmented cells were much more susceptible to ultraviolet-A-induced membrane permeability than pigmented cells.
