40|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} is sprinkled all over every landscape we may see, however {{the importance of}} these constructions are not often recognized. Aerial <b>maize</b> <b>drying</b> <b>sheds</b> {{played an important role in}} human development and settlements and still play a vital role in some regions' identity after remarkable advances in agriculture. These constructions share not only construction, material and form features, but also the areas where they can be found have common climatic and geographic conditions despite the physical distance. This review article intends to give a view of this vernacular type of construction. Not only will an architectural point of view be given, but also an ethnologic and historic perspective. It presents the biggest inflection point in these timeless objects, the introduction of maize [zea mays] in Europe and the adaptations required for a maximum profit as well as problems derived from that. Materials and construction systems used will also be included and their particular evolution in each studied region...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} establish the effect of the biomass-heated natural convection dryer on insect damage, mould infection, aflatoxin contamination and the germination potential of maize grain during storage. <b>Maize</b> grains were <b>dried</b> using two methods; on bare ground simulating farmer practices and using the biomass dryer. The <b>maize</b> <b>dried</b> on bare ground took five days to dry to safe storage moisture content of 14 % while that of the biomass dryer took only 6 h. <b>Drying</b> <b>maize</b> grain using the biomass dryer delayed insect infestation by three months and significantly (p≤ 0. 05) reduced mould and aflatoxin contamination during storage for 6 months. <b>Maize</b> <b>dried</b> using the biomass dryer was only infested with Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) while that dried on bare ground was infested by both the moth and the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) implying that the biomass dryer controlled the most important storage insect pest of <b>maize</b> in Uganda. <b>Drying</b> <b>maize</b> using the biomass dryer had no effect on the germination potential of the grain. Thus, <b>drying</b> <b>maize</b> grain with the biomass dryer reduces drying time and greatly improves the quality of the grain during storage. However, the subsequent storage quality of the grain highly depends on the storage form (shelled or unshelled), time and environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} study exploring {{the use of}} jatropha seed cake as a sole source of nutrients and used in combination with inorganic N fertilizer was conducted on station at Henderson Research Station on sandy and clayey soils {{during the rainy season}} of 2006 / 2007. Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of jatropha seed cake on <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter and grain yield and its effect on weed density and biomass. Experiment 1 explored the use of jatropha seed cake rates ranging from 767 kg/ha to 3835 kg/ha in maize production. Included in the experiment were three other treatments viz extension recommendation for inorganic fertilizer, farmerÂ¡Â¦s practice of applying cattle manure and a control. A Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) was used and a total of 8 treatments were assessed. Jatropha seed cake application rate and inorganic fertilizer had higher yields (P â€žT 0. 05) on <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter yield at 4, 8 and 12 wace on the sandy soil site. Application of 2301 kg/ha of jatropha seed cake and the extension recommendation resulted in <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter yields of 3059 kg/ha and 3399 kg/ha respectively at 12 wace. There were no differences noted in <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter yields on the clayey soil site. Weed densities of the following species F exilis and Eragrostis spp (sandy soil site) and T. annua, C. rotundus, and L. martinicensis (clayey soil site) were significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) where jatropha seed cake was applied. Weed biomass on the sandy soil site was reduced by 30...|$|R

Some of the isolates were toxic. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) have been inserted to C. sakazakii and used as a marker for selective enumeration due to the ability of this protein to fluoresce under UV and to tolerate in ampicillin containing media. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the survival, colonization and penetration of two isolates of C. sakazakii from dried food product during <b>maize</b> <b>drying.</b> The <b>maize</b> was challenged with mutants at a concentration of 105 - 106 CFU/g before <b>drying.</b> <b>Maize</b> <b>drying</b> was performed at temperature of 40, 45 and 50 ºC for 4, 6 and 8 days until the moisture content reached 14...|$|R
40|$|The {{residual}} soil fertility {{benefits of the}} preceding legumes to the following maize crop were demonstrated in the study. Incorporating stover of Bambara nut, cowpea, groundnut dry bean and soyabean gave higher maize yields compared to plots where the stover was removed. Total <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter yield increases of 1. 30 tha-¹ to 5. 19 ha-¹ were recorded following legume stover incorporation compared to stover removal. Even removal of stover of these same legumes gave significant maize yield increases compared to those from the maize after maize or after fallow plots. The total <b>maize</b> <b>dry</b> matter yield was greater after legumes with stover removed (ranging from 4. 41 to 9. 91 tha¯¹) than after maize (2. 16 to 2. 26 tha¯¹) or one season fallow (1. 57 to 1. 84 tha¯¹).
