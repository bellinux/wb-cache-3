The magneto-thermal problem is solved by the Brandt method for the magnetic part, associated with a standard discretization of the stationary heat equation.

40|$|We {{study the}} AC losses in an {{infinitely}} long cylinder {{made of a}} superconducting core surrounded by a non-magnetic <b>metallic</b> <b>sheath</b> and subjected to an axial magnetic field. The losses are computed by assuming the Bean–Kim model for the superconductor and Ohmic dissipation for the metal. The time varying magnetic flux crossing the superconductor induces eddy currents in the metal sheath and, due to the nonlinear response of the superconducting material, generates harmonics in the metal current density. In turn, these currents generate distorted magnetic fields acting back on the superconductor. This coupling mechanism is sensitive to the magnetic constitutive law of the superconductor and affects both the waveform of the fields and the total losses.

A carriage, slidingly mounted to the frame, has rollers that embrace an outer surface of the power cable so that the carriage "floats" on the cable in use. A milling tool with its drive motor is supported on the carriage and is adjustable up and down to enable a depth to be chosen. As a result, the sheath is cut through and inner strands of the power cable are not damaged. The effective depth of the remote end of the cutting tool is controlled by operation of a first motor 20, and the carriage is driven along in use the frame by a second motor so that the cutter can operate automatically without close manual supervision.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{decrease}} of the magnetization of a bulk superconducting sample {{when it is}} subjected to a perpendicular AC magnetic field (field" configuration). The effect of a transverse AC magnetic field on the permanent magnetization of the supercon- ductor are twofold: (i) the superconducting currents are redistributed in the supercon- ductor, and (ii) AC losses are generated, which may locally increase the temperature and degrade the superconducting properties. These two phenomena (current redistribution and losses) are differently affected by the frequency and the amplitude of the transverse magnetic field. The goal {{of this study is to}} identify the sets of experimental conditions that accentuate each of these two effects, and more specifically to assess their importance in crossed field experiments being carried in our research group.

40|$|A set of fault {{location}} algorithms for underground medium voltage cables, two incipient fault detection schemes for distribution cables {{and a state}} estimation method for underground distribution networks are developed in this thesis. Two schemes are designed to detect and classify incipient faults in underground distribution cables. Based on the methodology of wavelet analysis, one scheme is to detect the fault-induced transients, and therefore identify the incipient faults. Based on {{the analysis of the}} superimposed fault current and negative sequence current in time domain, the other scheme is particularly suitable to detect the single-line-to-ground incipient faults, which are mostly occurring in underground cables. To verify the effectiveness and functionalities of the proposed detection algorithms, different fault conditions, various system configurations, real field cases and normal operating transients are examined. The simulation results have demonstrated a technical feasibility for practical implementations of both schemes. Based on the methodology of the direct circuit analysis, a set of location algorithms is proposed to locate the single phase related faults in the typical underground medium voltage cables. A large number of complex nonlinear equations are effectively solved to find the fault distance and fault resistance. The algorithms only utilize the fundamental phasors of three-phase voltages and currents recorded at single end, normally at substation. The various system and fault conditions are taken into account in the development of algorithms, such as effects of shunt capacitance, mutual effects of <b>metallic</b> <b>sheaths,</b> common sheath bonding methods and different fault scenarios. The extensive simulations have validated the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In order to extend the proposed {{fault location}} algorithms to underground distribution networks, a state estimation algorithm is developed to provide the necessary information for the location algorithms. Taking account of the complexity and particularity of cable circuits, the problem of the state estimation is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem that is solved by the sequential quadratic programming technique. The simulation studies have indicated that the proposed fault location scheme incorporating with the state estimation algorithm can achieve good performance under different load and fault conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents novel {{application of}} spintronic sensors in power system monitoring. Spintronic sensors including giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors are advanced in magnetic field sensing. In power industry, power-frequency magnetic fields {{are produced by}} electric power sources, equipment and power lines. Thus {{it is impossible for}} monitoring the power system by sensing the emanated magnetic field. In Chapter 2, a novel concept based on magnetoresistive (MR) sensors is proposed for transmission line monitoring. A proof-of-concept laboratory setup was constructed and a series of experiments were carried out for demonstration. The result shows the feasibility of using this power system monitoring method in reality. In order to handle complicated transmission line configuration with the proposed method, an improved current monitoring technology is proposed in Chapter 3. It is realized by developing a current source reconstruction method based on stochastic optimization strategy. This concept of current monitoring by magnetic field sensing and current source reconstruction was experimentally implemented and verified in our laboratory setup. A typical model of 500 kV three-phase transmission lines was simulated to further corroborate this technology. The reconstruction results for the 500 kV transmission lines verify the feasibility and practicality of this novel current monitoring technology based on magnetic field sensing {{at the top of a}} transmission tower for monitoring overhead transmission lines. Chapter 4 offers further improvement of the transmission-line monitoring technology. Improved technology can measure simultaneously both electrical and spatial parameters of multiple lines in real-time in a non-contact way. Two typical models of high-voltage three-phase transmission lines were simulated and the resulting magnetic fields were calculated. A source reconstruction method was developed to reconstruct the spatial and electrical parameters from the magnetic field emanated by the overhead transmission lines. The reconstruction results for the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines verify the feasibility and practicality of this non-contact transmission-line monitoring technology based on magnetic field sensing. As well as the high-voltage transmission-line, the technology is applied in underground power cable operation-state monitoring and energization-status identification in Chapter 5. The magnetic field distribution of the cable was studied by using finite element method (FEM) for the power cable operating in different states, i. e. current-energized state (the cable is energized and carries load current) and voltage-energized state (the cable is energized but carries no load current). Application of this method was demonstrated on an 11 kV cable with <b>metallic</b> outer <b>sheath.</b> The results highly matched with the actual source parameters of the cable. An experimental setup was constructed and the test results were used for demonstration this method.

40|$|An {{alternative}} “in situ” {{process to}} the MgB 2 wire manufacturing {{is represented by}} the Reactive Mg-Liquid Infiltration (Mg-RLI) process [1], in which the precursor wire is constituted by a <b>metallic</b> <b>sheath</b> encasing a central Mg rod, surrounded by the B powders. We demonstrated that this peculiar “internal Mg” assembly is able to produce very dense superconducting material of high critical current density, with an acceptable fill factor, up to 0. 28. Furthermore the Mg-RLI allows also to easily dope the MgBB 2 material either by carbon or nanoSiC powders. In order to realize long cables with this technique, two different approaches may be applied. The first one relies on the assembly of thin wires, fine enough that the liquid Mg cannot freely percolate along the wire during the reaction, and the second one relies on the assembly of thick hollow wires, reacted with a continuous supply of Mg to avoid deficiency of Mg in some part of the precursor wire. Both techniques have been demonstrated feasible and the relative usefulness is discussed. As far as the large superconducting magnets are concerned, either for future physics applications or for fusion reactors, it will be evident the great advantage of the low weight of the MgB 2 B wires, other than their good performances at intermediate high magnetic fields: typically of the order of 4 T at temperatures of about 20 K...|$|E
40|$|High {{frequency}} signal propagation characteristics of shielded power cables, including attenuation, electromagnetic propagation velocity, and characteristic impedance, are determined mainly by the dielectric properties of cable insulation and semiconductive shields, {{as well as}} the <b>metallic</b> <b>sheath</b> structure. High frequency attenuation in two transmission class XLPE cables with differing ground structures is studied by computation and measurement. High {{frequency signal}} propagation in tape shield power cables is related to the conduction of the tape laps as the corrosion thereof forces sheath current to spiral down the tape. Computations and measurements have been conducted to study high frequency signal propagation characteristics in such cable as a function of fraction of spiraling sheath current and cable material properties. ^ Optimization of partial discharge (PD) detection technology based on historical evolution of key technologies is investigated with the conclusion that a fully digital is presently practical for a bandwidth in the range of 20 MHz which will increase to 100 MHz within a few years. ^ Three dimensional finite element analysis is applied to calculate PD magnitude as a function of discharge characteristics in a complex object, in this case, a separable connector. The PD magnitude is estimated from the product of the change of capacitance when discharge occurs and the partial discharge extinction voltage (PDEV). The calculated PD magnitude is compared with measurements for a controlled 2 ̆ 2 defect 2 ̆ 2 in a separable connector. ...|$|E
30|$|The DM channel {{model is}} well {{established}} (verified through measurements) and widely adopted in literature (see [23 – 25], and references therein). In particular, a stochastic MIMO channel model based on Gaussian distribution is proposed in [23] that extends the conventional 99 % worst case model [2]. Similarly, crosstalk models based on beta distribution [24] and sum-of-sinusoids [25] have been suggested to characterize the crosstalk accurately. However, an analytical model for the CM channel is not well studied in the literature. In [6], a split-pair signaling (based on the multi-conductor transmission-line theory) that offers 2 N - 1 modes of transmissions in a binder of N pairs is presented by considering one of the wires as a joint common reference for all other wires. Although this configuration can provide significant improvement in data rate, the presence of ingress or egress limits the potential use of split-pair (usually not twisted) signalling. A CM channel model has also been suggested in [5] by considering the metallic-sheath of the binder as a common reference. This configuration (of 2 N modes) is more reliable than the split-pair signalling and significantly reduces the effect of ingress and egress on the binder provided the <b>metallic</b> <b>sheath</b> is grounded properly. A CM channel has also been developed using the shield of the binder as a reference point [26]. In [27], achievable throughput using this model has been investigated {{in the presence of}} radio ingress. It is noted that no experimental data are available for the transfer functions of any of the CM channel suggested so far.|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{attracting}} increasing levels {{of research and}} investment. The use of HVDC transmission {{and the development of}} DC grids are topics with similar high levels of interest that go {{hand in hand with the}} development of large scale, far from shore wind farms. Despite increased capital cost of some components, DC power transmission can have significant advantages over AC transmission, in particular in the offshore environment. These advantages are well established for large scale, long distance point to point transmission. This thesis assesses the suitability of a multi-terminal DC power collection network, with short cables and relatively small amounts of power, addresses a number of the technical challenges in realising such a network and shows methods for overall system cost reduction. Technical and modelling challenges result from the interaction between power electronic DC-DC converters and the cables in a DC transmission network. In particular, the propagation of the ripple current in bipole DC transmission cables constructed with a <b>metallic</b> <b>sheath</b> and armour is examined in detail. The finite element method is used to predict the response of the cable to the ripple current produced by the converters. These results are used along with wave propagation theory to demonstrate that cable design plays a crucial role in the behaviour of the DC system. The frequency dependent cable models are then integrated with time domain DC-DC converter models. The work in the thesis is, broadly, in two parts. First, it is demonstrated that care and accuracy are required in modelling the cables in the DC transmission system and appropriate models are implemented and validated. Second, these models are combined with DC-DC converter models and used to demonstrate the practicality of the DC grid, make design recommendations and assess its suitability when compared with alternative approaches (e. g. AC collection and/or transmission) ...|$|E
