40|$|A numerical/experimental {{procedure}} is proposed for calculating the residual stress state during the cooling {{phase of the}} casting process of a superduplex stainless steel (ASTM A 890 Gr. 5 A). The experimental activity consisted of casting, tensile and creep tests. Casting tests were used to set (by acquiring temperature data at different points) and validate (by measuring displacements after releasing residual stresses by cutting) the Finite Element model. Tensile and creep tests {{were used to determine}} the material properties from room temperature to 1200 °C. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis was conducted by neglecting the presence of the sand mould; instead, attention was focused on the material by modelling the creep behaviour using the Bailey-Norton formulation. Measurements of the of the displacements due to the stress release after EDM wire cuts revealed to be in good agreement with the numerical model and confirmed the key role played by viscosity during the cooling phase. Neglecting the viscous strain led to an overestimation (more than twofold) of the stress level in the cast part after the cooling phase in the sand <b>mould.</b> The <b>good</b> matching between experimental and numerical data indicated that a numerical model that incorporates the creep behaviour is able to accurately capture the investigated phenomenon, despite the simplification in the modelling of the casting process (sand mould replaced with virtual convection) which does not substantially affect its accuracy.

40|$|Methacrylate is a {{valuable}} tool to the neurosurgeon, {{even though it is}} currently being replaced by custom bone. During cranioplasty in the absence of custom bone, which is preformed based on the patients imaging, one has to make a cast to cover the cranial defect with or without the use of a <b>mould.</b> A <b>good</b> artificial skull outline is necessary for prevention of implant extrusion and acceptable cosmetic outcome. Using the patients head as a mould is a simple, cheap, and useful technique. An incision is made, and either a craniectomy or an attempt at skull elevation or separation of the scalp from dura is done based on the indication for the cranioplasty. The methacrylate monomer is mixed with its solvent. It is placed in between a sliced glove and then thinned out. Several layers of drapes are placed on the patients head, the acrylate which is in between the gloves is then placed on the drapes. As soon as it starts setting and the required shape obtained, it is removed and place on the sterile tray. It is then anchored and the wound closed. This technique produces good cosmetic outcome. However, the head must be properly protected from the risk of burns from the exothermic reaction. The technique is described in a 40 -year-old driver who had a compound depressed skull fracture. He had a methylmethacrylate cranioplasty in the 9 th week post trauma after allowing for wound healing.

40|$|Cyclic {{oligomers}} {{have low}} molecular weights and therefore exhibit very low viscosities (in {{the order of}} 20 mPa. s) {{in contrast to the}} resulting high viscosities related to high molecular weightsobtained after polymerization. This characteristic is very appealing for the production of polymer composites since by taking advantage of the low viscosity, fibres can be thoroughly wetted by the cyclic oligomer before starting the reactive process of polymerization. As a result, a homogeneous mixture with a uniform volumetric distribution of reinforcing fibres in the polymer matrix is expected with the use of appropriate processing equipment. Cyclic butylene terephthalate (CBT) has been successfully polymerized into poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) using a variety of tin or titanate-based initiators. An exploratory project has been initiated by NRC at the Magna-NRC Composites Centre of Excellence (MNCCE) with the participation of Cyclics Corporation (Cyclics) as the supplier of CBT for trials using the D-LFT process.

Though NIL has been demonstrated to be very successful in replicating nanoscale features, it also has its limitations as a general lithography technique.

Aeration proved particularly important whenever B. subtilis cells were present in the steep liquor. The optimal temperatures for α- and β-amylase were 30 and 25 °C, respectively. By increasing the steeping time it was possible to improve the α-amylase activity, but the -amylase activity peaked sharply between 16 and 20 h, depending on the steeping medium.

40|$|Objectives: For {{application}} as scaffolds {{for heart}} valve tissue engineering, a method is researched to produce homogeneous thin collagen leaflets from commercially available collagen solutions. Materials and methods: Collagen Moulding is a rapid manufacturing method {{for the production}} of thin collagen leaflets by allowing a collagen solution to gel in an open mould, after which the gels are desiccated. Experiments were performed with an Apcoll (Devro, UK) collagen solution of 3 mg/ml; the mould cavities were designed for leaflet thickness values of 30 and 50 µm; they had a surface area of 12 * 12 mm². The scaffolds were visually inspected with a Keyence VHX 500 microscope and their mechanical properties were determined in a flexural indentation experiment, after which they were compared to natural valve cusps. All scaffolds were seeded with early passage (2 to 3) ovine mesenchymal stem cells; cell proliferation was quantified after 72 hours by means of an ELISA assay and histology. Results: The Collagen Moulding technique proved to yield structurally intact and reproducible collagen leaflets of 30 and 50 µm thickness. The scaffolds are stable in watery surroundings and can be stored under either dry or wet conditions. Although properties are observed to increase with scaffold thickness, the leaflets proved rather weak in terms of mechanical properties. The maximum load which they can withstand is only 10 % of that of the natural cusp and their flexural stiffness parameter reaches a mere 20 % of the value for the natural counterpart. Concerning cell proliferation, the ELISA assay yielded optical density values between 0. 8 and 1 for all scaffolds, indicating good cell attachment to the surface. Histology results showed confluent cell layers on the collagen leaflets. While the collagen parts demonstrate auspicious results for cell proliferation, they are too weak mechanically to be conditioned as heart valve cusps. A strategy which would merit further investigation is combining these collagen gels with synthetic biocompatible polymers, which by themselves lack the necessary binding locations required for cell attachment. Using these polymers as a structural backbone, however, and coating them with a collagen top layer, would combine the most beneficial properties of both material classes. Conclusions: Thin leaflet scaffolds produced by Collagen <b>Moulding</b> display <b>good</b> cell interaction qualities but insufficient mechanical properties. For further research, hybrid scaffolds with a synthetic polymer backbone and a collagen top layer are considered...|$|R
