500|$|According to Sánchez, on Friday, November 6, 2009, she {{and three}} others were taken in her own {{neighborhood}} by men working for the Cuban government. She {{said that she was}} heading to an anti-violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (she stated that the other two were placed into another car). She characterizes the event on her blog, Generation Y, as a [...] "kidnapping" [...] and describes the event in detail. [...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and I shouted, 'Help, these <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows to her head, legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever." [...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be" [...] and [...] "something like a Casanova." [...] Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans." [...] He also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again. Another change was to air The Simpsons in 720p high-definition television with the episode [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] on February 15, 2009. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction {{since the beginning of the}} show's second season in 1990; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over Springfield.|$|E

The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him so I could see if that was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what I imagined. He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E

2500|$|Cutolo had {{established}} himself as a ringleader, when Antonio Spavone, known as [...] "'o Malommo" [...] (The Badman), was transferred to Poggioreale prison. He challenged Spavone to a knife fight in the courtyard (a practice called o dichiaramento, the declaration), but Spavone refused. The challenged boss allegedly limited himself to a reply: [...] "Today's young <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> die young by whatever means." [...] Spavone was released from prison shortly after this event. From his prison cell, Cutolo ordered the murder of Spavone. A hitman, allegedly Cutolo's friend, shot Spavone in the face from short range with a shotgun. Spavone survived the ambush, but the shotgun blast left considerable damage to his facial structure, which required plastic surgery. Spavone immediately resigned from his highly visible role as a Camorra boss.|$|E
2500|$|Gail Dines, {{writing in}} Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality, {{describes}} the money {{shot of a}} man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as [...] "one of the most degrading acts in porn". To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body [...] "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, [...] "I'd like to really show what I believe the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have." [...] She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.|$|E

Equally, the British commander of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders singled out the Australian 2/29th as fighting with [...] "great coolness" [...] and worthy of entering battle with them, while Masanobu Tsuji wrote that in Malaya the Australians [...] "fought with a bravery…not previously seen".|$|E
