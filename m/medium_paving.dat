40|$|Under strong laser illumination, few-layer {{graphene}} exhibits both a transmittance increase due to saturable absorption and a nonlinear phase shift. Here, we unambiguously distinguish {{these two}} nonlinear optical effects and identify both real and imaginary {{parts of the}} complex nonlinear refractive index of graphene. We show that graphene possesses a giant nonlinear refractive index n 2 $simeq$ 10 textminus 7 ?cm 2 ?Wtextminus 1, almost 9 orders of magnitude larger than bulk dielectrics. We find that the nonlinear refractive index decreases with increasing excitation flux but slower than the absorption. This suggests that graphene may be a very promising nonlinear <b>medium,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for graphene-based nonlinear photonics. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The joint {{combination of the}} eutectic mixture and an appropriate hydrophilic sensitizer afforded a DSSC with a power conversion efficiency comparable to that using the same electrolyte composition but with conventional, toxic, and volatile solvents as the <b>medium,</b> which thereby <b>paves</b> {{the way to a}} new generation of eco-friendly, nature-inspired, low-cost solar devices...|$|R
40|$|Human {{heads on}} animal bodies, people in fanciful landscapes, faces that are deftly morphed into common {{household}} objects - these {{are among the}} Victorian experiments in photo collage seen and explained in this marvelous book. With sharp wit and dramatic shifts of scale, these images flouted the serious conventions of photography in the 1860 s and 1870 s. Often made by women for albums, they reveal the educated minds and accomplished hands of their makers, taking on the new theory of evolution, addressing the changing role of photography, and challenging the strict conventions of aristocratic society. Although these photo collages may seem wonderfully odd to us now, the authors argue that they are actually perfectly in keeping with the Victorian sensibility that embraced juxtaposition and variety. This delightful book, the first to examine comprehensively the little-known phenomenon of Victorian photo collage, presents imagery that has rarely - and, in many cases, never - been displayed or reproduced. Illuminating text provides a history of Victorian photo collage albums, identifies the common motifs found in them, and demonstrates the distinctly modern character of the <b>medium,</b> which <b>paved</b> the way for the future avant-garde potential of both photography and collage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a novel radio channel model inside the human skin at the terahertz range, which will enable the interaction among potential nano-machines operating in the inter cellular areas of the human skin. Thorough studies are performed on the attenuation of electromagnetic waves inside the human skin, while taking into account the frequency of operation, distance between the nano-machines and number of sweat ducts. A novel channel model is presented for communication of nano-machines inside the human skin and its validation is performed by varying the aforementioned parameters with a reasonable accuracy. The statistics of error prediction between simulated and modeled data are: mean (μ) = 0. 6 dB and standard deviation (σ) = 0. 4 dB, which indicates the high accuracy of the prediction model as compared with measurement data from simulation. In addition, the results of proposed channel model are compared with terhaertz time-domain spectroscopy based measurement of skin sample and the statistics of error prediction in this case are: μ = 2. 10 dB and σ = 6. 23 dB, which also validates the accuracy of proposed model. Results in this paper highlight the issues and related challenges while characterizing the communication in such a <b>medium,</b> thus <b>paving</b> the way towards novel research activities devoted to the design and the optimization of advanced applications in the healthcare domain...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} high-efficiency method for direct {{generation}} of all-solid-state single- and dual-vortex lasers operating at eye-safe wavelengths is {{reported in a}} compact diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser cavity. By off-axis pumping of the Nd:YAG in two orthogonal directions, the original cavity mode, fundamental Gaussian mode (TEM 00), is directly transformed into first-order Laguerre-Gaussian (LG 01) mode with single- or dual-vortex structures depending {{on the degree of}} the off-axis pumping. Moreover, the single- and dual-vortex lasers can be produced in simultaneous eye-safe dual-wavelength operation with the aid of an intracavity etalon. At the same time, a novel method to determine the handedness of achieved vortex lasers by using a plane-concave mirror with suitable coating is also proposed. This method can be perfectly applied to generate vortex lasers at other emissions bands for various applications by using different laser gain <b>mediums.</b> This work <b>paves</b> a general way to simple and efficient realization and determination of vortex lasers...|$|R
40|$|Micro-sized spheres {{can focus}} light into subwavelength spatial domains: a {{phenomena}} called photonic nanojet. Even though well studied in three-dimensional (3 D) configurations, {{only a few}} attempts {{have been reported to}} observe similar phenomena in two-dimensional (2 D) systems. This, however, is important to take advantage of photonic nanojets in integrated optical systems. Usually, surface plasmon polaritons are suggested for this purpose, but they suffer notoriously from the rather low propagation lengths due to intrinsic absorption. Here, we solve this problem and explore, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, the use of Bloch surface waves sustained by a suitably structured all-dielectric media to enable subwavelength focusing in an integrated planar optical system. Since only a low index contrast can be achieved while relying on Bloch surface waves, we perceive a new functional element that allows a tight focusing and the observation of a photonic nanojet on top of the surface. We experimentally demonstrate a spot size of 0. 66 λ in the effective <b>medium.</b> Our approach <b>paves</b> the way to 2 D all-dielectric photonic chips for nano-particle manipulation in fluidic devices and sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|The thesis work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of cryopreservation strategy for long term storage of MSCs and MSCs seeded tissue engineered constructs using non toxic cryoprotective agents as freezing medium. In the first phase, different freezing medium consisting of a combination of natural extracellular cryoprotectants namely trehalose, hydroxyl ethyl starch, polyvinyl pyrolidine and intracellular CPAs like erythritol, taurine and ectoin were used for cryopreservation of MNCs following the Taguchi Orthogonal Array method. Among the various combinations, freezing medium consisting of trehalose (0. 05 mM), ectoin (0. 10 mM) and catalase (100 μg/ml) has shown maximum MNCs viability. These CPAs were further investigated individually as well as in combination to see their effectiveness towards long term preservation of MSCs. Among the freezing solutions, solution prepared using trehalose (0. 3 mM), ectoin (0. 3 mM), and catalase (100 μg/ml) was found to be the most effective in preserving MSCs in long term basis. The viability of MSCs (73 %) is found to be higher than the viability achieved with 10 % (v/v) Me 2 SO (61 %) used as control. The apoptotic study has indicated that the addition of general caspase and calpain inhibitors can reduce the apoptosis rate upto 10 - 15 % thereby achieving increased cell viability of 80 %. The optimum condition for the controlled rate freezing of MSCs was established as prenucleation cooling rate - 1 oC/min, nucleation temperature - 7. 5 oC, cold spike - 80 oC/min, post nucleation holding time 5 min, post nucleation cooling rate - 1 oC/min, cell density (3 × 106 /ml/cell) and storage temperature (- 150 °C) using the most effective freezing medium achieving cell viability of 85 %. The developed freezing medium has also shown its ability to preserve MSCs seeded tissue engineered construct. The maximum viability of 80 % achieved at optimum controlled rate freezing of TECs was established as cooling rate - 1 oC/min, nucleation temperature - 7. 5 OC and freezing medium consisting of trehalose (0. 3 mM), ectoin (0. 3 mM), catalase (100 μg/ml) in presence of caspase (50 μg) and calpain (50 μg) inhibitors. Overall, it is demonstrated that the developed freezing <b>medium</b> may <b>pave</b> the way for long term preservation of MSCs and also MSCs seeded scaffold...|$|R
