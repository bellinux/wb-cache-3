40|$|A {{fast and}} {{reliable}} method {{for the analysis}} of airborne loaded filters becomes more and more important for monitoring campaigns and inventory studies at sites with airborne pollution. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) can perform quantitative analysis on filters without any pretreatment. Quantitative determination of various metals on loaded filters requires the use of calibration curves set up with synthetic filters. For accurate analysis, the calibration standards have to be prepared with a comparable matrix composition as the real filter samples. Therefore, cellulose nitrate filters were loaded by means of aerosol generation with various metals. The performance of an optimized aerosol generation system, based on the ultrasonic nebulization of a <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution,</b> is presented in this work. A <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution</b> is converted into a fine dense aerosol by ultrasonic action. The produced aerosol is dried and collected onto a filter. Filters can be loaded sequentially with a maximum standard deviation of 5 % for various metal concentrations. The influence of loading time and alteration of the initial metal concentration on the obtained elemental concentration have been investigated. Finally, the validation of the XRF measurement method is described. The linearity and sensitivity of the calibration curves are calculated for the various metals. The XRF detection limits, repeatability, and accuracy are determined. The XRF analysis of real filter samples is confirmed by subsequent analysis of filter samples with ICP-OES after acid digestion...|$|E

These were subsequently compared with our archaeological materials from KA- 5 (Figure 3). Modern samples of feline, canine and human teeth were in-cluded in each time-series for comparative sampling. Samples of weathered deer (cervid) bone were included to test {{for the effects of}} loss of periosteum and advanced exposure bleaching on cortical surfaces. For elemental analysis, whole tooth and bone samples were cut in order to expose the entire crown bisecting the roots, or axially across the cortical bone from periostial surface to inner trabeculae. Each sample was then embedded in epoxy discs for LA-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS imaging and analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{nanofiltration}} as a pretreatment {{step in a}} zero rejection {{process was}} investigated. Nanoflux, a nanofiltration simulation software, was used to predict the rejection of Co 2 + and Ni 2 + from a salty multi-element matrix whose concentration is similar to seawater. Orientation simulations prior to filtration experiments were made with Nanoflux in order to predict ionic rejections. Previously, the multi-element matrix solution speciation was studied by JChess. It was shown that the effective membrane charge and the effective membrane thickness, adjusted through the filtration of a single salt NaNO 3 solution, {{could be used to}} predict the ionic rejections of the <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution</b> for two commercial nanofiltration membranes. The elevated concentration of NaNO 3 in the multi-electrolyte solution did not reduce the high ionic selectivity of divalent ions. Predicted values were in good agreement with experimental results at neutral pH of the multi-electrolyte solution...|$|E
40|$|Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) {{experiments}} impose stringent {{requirements on}} a detection system, {{due to the}} need for processing ionizing events at a high rate, typically above of 10 Mcps/cm{sup 2 }, and with a high resolution, typically better than 300 eV. The detection system here presented is being developed targeting these stringent requirements. It {{is the result of a}} cooperation between the Instrumentation Division and the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system is composed of a multi-element Si sensor with dedicated per pixel electronics. The combination of high rate, high resolution and moderate complexity makes this system attractive when compared to other <b>multi-element</b> <b>solutions.</b> In sections 2, 3 and 4 the sensor, the interconnect and the electronics are briefly described.

40|$|<b>Multi-element</b> <b>solutions</b> {{containing}} the 11 elements S, K, Sc, V, Mn, Co, Cu, Ga, As, Br and Y {{were analyzed by}} a portable total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectrometer. The excitation parameters (glancing angle, operational voltage and current) and sample amount were optimized for the portable TXRF in order to realize the smallest possible detection limits for all elements. The excitation parameter dependencies of the fluorescence signal and background for the detected elements are explained in detail. Background contributed by the sample carrier is also discussed. Consequently, nine elements were detectable at sub-nanogram levels in a single measurement of 10 min under the optimal experimental conditions. The portable TXRF spectrometer {{was found to be}} suitable for simultaneous multi-element analysis with low detection limits. The features of high sensitivity, small sample amount required, and fast detection {{of a wide range of}} elements make the portable TXRF a valuable tool in various applications, such as field studies in environmental and geological investigations...|$|R

For each run of analysis blank, certified reference materials (CRM) as internal standard {{along with the}} samples were analyzed in duplicate to eliminate any batch-specific error. <b>Multi-element</b> standard <b>solution</b> was used to prepare standard curve.

40|$|Human {{activities}} unintentionally add pollutants {{to water}} bodies. This {{research has focused}} on the removal of trace elements from sources of water pollution (point and non-point), using a mineral based by-product (Blueguard® solids). The materials were characterised to identify the mineralogy, structure, porosity, and composition using different techniques including X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry, X-ray Powder Diffraction and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller gas sorption methods. The results showed that the main compounds of the Blueguard® materials are alteration products of Mg-rich silicates. Three different types of contaminated water originating from different sources were prepared and analysed. These samples included (a) a <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution</b> prepared from trace element stock solutions; (b) rain water contaminated with motorway dust, and (c) contaminated water taken from an industrially polluted site (Cranleigh Brickworks, Surrey). Trace element analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using a batch equilibrium procedure with optimised conditions of 0. 25 g material in 50 ml solution for 5 min contact time, the mixing of the Blueguard® materials with a <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution</b> showed an effective removal of various trace elements under pH 4 to 9 conditions. These materials were then used to treat contaminated rainwater mixed with digested motorway dust. Trace element removal occurred from 80 % for manganese up to 100 % for lead. Analysis of surface water samples collected from the Cranleigh Brickworks showed that the levels of zinc and manganese were above the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for drinking water. The most contaminated lagoon (25950 µg l- 1 Zn and 2843 µg l- 1 Mn) on the site was selected for laboratory and on-site testing of the Blueguard® materials. The best removal efficiency for these types of materials took place under a static design system where more than 95 % of zinc and up to 97 % of manganese was removed. Further investigation of the Blueguard® materials suggested the mechanism by which these materials reduce the level of trace elements in a solution was by precipitation, as a result of pH increase (through release of OH-(aq)). The results obtained for metal removal at Cranleigh has resulted in the application of these materials to remediate the site...|$|E
40|$|The {{capabilities}} {{and limitations of}} nanosecond laser ablation ICP-mass spectrometry for bulk and spatially resolved (elemental mapping) analysis of iron meteorites were assessed. The quantitative data obtained were compared to those obtained i. via <b>multi-element</b> <b>solution</b> ICP-MS (after digestion) relying on external calibration and, ii. high-accuracy determination of selected platinum group elements using solution ICP-MS after target element isolation using anion exchange chromatography and deploying isotope dilution. Results generated by the different methods described show good agreement. Significant matrix effects were observed to affect {{the results of the}} ns-LA-ICP-MS analysis of iron meteorites, making quantification via a matrix-matched standard a prerequisite. Careless use of intensity distribution maps without proper correction for laser-solid coupling efficiency can lead to incorrect interpretation of the element maps. ns-LA-ICP-MS was shown to be suitable for fast and quasi-nondestructive analysis of iron meteorites, not only homogeneous ataxites and hexahedrites, but also more heterogeneous ones, when considering ablated areas of a sufficient size. In the context of elemental mapping using LA-ICP-MS, Pearson's product-moment correlation analysis was demonstrated to be a powerful tool that can provide valuable information on the fractionation of the elements in the parent bodies of meteorites...|$|E
30|$|Internal {{standards}} used included scandium (Sc, 100  µg/L), rhodium (Rh, 20  µg/L), germanium (Ge, 20  µg/L) and iridium (Ir, 10  µg/L), prepared with 2  % trace analysis grade HNO 3 (Fisher Scientific, UK). These {{were introduced to}} the sample stream via a T-piece. External multi-element calibration standards (Claritas-PPT grade CLMS- 2 from SPEX Certi-Prep Ltd, Stanmore, Middlesex, UK) included Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, U, V and Zn, concentrations of which were in the range blank (0) up to 100  µg/L (0, 20, 40, 100  µg/L). A tailored external <b>multi-element</b> calibration <b>solution</b> (PlasmaCAL, SCP Science, France) was used to create Ca, Mg, Na and K standards in the range 0 – 30  mg/L (0, 10, 20, 30  mg/L).

Additionally, 103 Rh, 115 In and 169 Tm {{were used as}} internal standards. Anion concentrations (Cl, NO 3, SO 4) were measured with ion chromatography [Dionex ICS- 1000, IonPac AS 4 A-SC (2009), AS 14 (2010 / 2012)] using a Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 -Eluent with a flow rate of 2  ml/min.

Chemical analyses of the CSG water samples were conducted at Lanfax Laboratories, a laboratory that has National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accreditation. Metal concentrations of experimental samples were analysed using an Agilent 720 Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), every element was analysed in triplicate for every sample and used by the instrument to estimate relative standard deviation (RSD) automatically (< 5  %).

40|$|Copper, lead, {{manganese}} {{and zinc}} have been determined in extracts of industrially-contaminated soil to investigate possible sources of {{variability in the}} three-stage sequential extraction procedure recommended by BCR. Analysis was performed by name or electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, using reagent matched, <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solutions.</b> Interferences were assessed by use of a single-point standard addition. Although the distribution of contaminants in the soil {{was expected to be}} heterogeneous, little difference in precision was found when replicate samples ranging in mass from 1 - 5 g were extracted, provided the extractant:soil ratio was kept constant. Significant differences in operational speciation were, however, obtained when the procedure was carried out independently by three different analysts. This {{may be due to the}} critical effect of pH in Step 2. Reproducibility was higher for air-dried than for field-moist soils, but larger amount of metals were extracted, suggesting alterations in speciation occurred during drying...|$|R
40|$|Cocoa shells are {{commonly}} used in the horticulture field. This inexpensive sub-strate was studied for metal removal from acidic effluents. Batch adsorption tests in shake flasks revealed that cocoa shells were particularly efficient for lead removal. More than 90 % of lead could be removed from a mono-metallic solution containing 51. 8 mg Pb/L (250 µM Pb) using 20 g/L of cocoa shells. Langmuir isotherm indicated that cocoa shells have a maximum lead uptake of 7. 56 mg/g (36. 5 µmol/g) at pH = 2. 0. Adsorption tests were also successfully com-pleted with three types of heavily contaminated acid effluents: a <b>multi-element</b> synthetic <b>solution</b> and effluents produced during sewage sludge and soil decontamination.

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} inductively couple plasma {{mass spectrometry}} (LA-ICP-MS) {{has become a}} popular technique for direct analysis of trace elements in solids. It is however important that LA-ICP-MS analysis is performed together with adequate calibration {{in order to provide}} quantitative data. In this work, we developed a calibration strategy for the analysis of airborne particles collected on cellulose filters. The calibration was performed using dried droplets of <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solutions</b> placed on a cellulose filter. The size of the drop was measured and the density of trace elements was determined. The standards were analysed by LA-ICP-MS and the signal was related to element density. A series of 10 samples collected in Boston (USA) using a high volume PM 10 impactor was then analysed. In this report, the calibration strategy is explained and the performance of LA-ICP-MS for the analysis of air samples is tested.

40|$|International audienceThree {{configurations}} of {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometers (ICPMS), namely: a quadrupole (QMS) and a sector-field (SFMS), both equipped with a standard cylindrical ablation cell, and an orthogonal time-of-flight (TOFMS), equipped with a fast washout ablation cell, were coupled with the same 193 nm Excimer laser ablation system in order to evaluate their capabilities for measurement of multiple minor and trace elements in small quantities of liquids (pl to nl), such as fluid inclusions. Analyses were performed with different objects: (i) <b>multi-element</b> <b>solutions</b> sealed in silica capillaries of internal diameter of 20 mm serving as synthetic analogues of natural fluid inclusions; (ii) natural two-phase (liquid + vapour) fluid inclusions with low salinity (ca. 4. 8 wt% NaCl eq.) and homogeneous compositions, trapped in quartz crystals from the Alps; (iii) natural multi-phase (liquid + vapour + multiple solids) fluid inclusions with high salinity (ca. 13 - 15 wt% NaCl eq.) and homogeneous compositions, trapped in quartz crystals from the Zambian Copperbelt. This study demonstrates that the SFMS and TOFMS provide improvements, particularly in term of limits of detection (LODs) and precision, compared to the QMS traditionally used for the measurement of fluid inclusions. SFMS leads on average to lower LODs within one order of magnitude compared to QMS and TOFMS, but precision and accuracy are lower due to longer acquisition cycle times. TOFMS presents both advantages of having rapid and quasi-simultaneous acquisition for all isotopes from Li- 6 to U- 238 {{in a very short}} cycle time down to 30 ms, with higher precisions and lower LODs than for QMS for isotopes with m/Q > 11. Its use, coupled to a fast washout cell, leads to (i) the improvement in the analysis of small-size (< 10 mu m) and multi-phase fluid inclusions and (ii) detection of higher number of isotopes compared to QMS and SFMS, which are both limited by the number of measured isotopes from short transient signals of fluid inclusions. Consequently, the tested TOFMS, coupled with a fast washout ablation cell, appears to be a promising instrument for the analysis of natural fluid inclusions by LA-ICPMS, especially for small, multi-phase and/or low salinity fluid inclusions...|$|R

Vanadium (IV) was selectively extracted using a mixture of 10 % (v/v) di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid and 5 % (v/v) tri-n-butylphosphate in sulfonated kerosene. Using six extraction and five stripping stages, the extraction efficiency for vanadium was 96. 7 % and the stripping efficiency was 99. 7 %. V 2 O 5 with a purity of 99. 52 % was obtained by oxidation of the loaded strip solution and precipitation of ammonium polyvanadate at pH 1. 8 to 2. 2, followed by calcination of the dried precipitate at 550 °C for 2 h.

River sediment samples were collected between November 2002 and January 2003 for the first campaign, and between November 2003 and January 2004 for the second campaign. The samples were kept frozen until they were lyophilized, grounded in {{a mortar and pestle}} and sieved. A fraction less than 63 mu m was taken for the analysis. Different acid combinations were investigated for the digestion of sediment samples: HCl/HNO 3, HClO 4 /HNO 3 and HF/HCl/HNO 3 / H 3 BO(3) in a microwave digestion system. Complete dissolution of materials was achieved with the latter. Optimum values for instrumental parameters of the ICP-MS were sought and set up. <b>Multi-element</b> standard <b>solutions</b> were used for the calibration of the procedure.

40|$|Multi-element trace {{analysis}} by laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of high-purity metals, semiconductors and insulators (e. g., ceramics) is often limited {{by the lack of}} suitable standard reference materials (SRM) with the same matrix composition and also a lack of a significant number of certified trace element concentrations in the available SRMs. This paper describes a new and easy standard-free quantification strategy using solution-based calibration for the multi-element determination of trace impurities in high-purity platinum. For the mass spectrometric measurements, a quadrupole-based LA-ICP-MS instrument was coupled with an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN). Due to the lack of a high-purity blank platinum sample, quantification of the results of LA-ICP-MS measurements was carried out using the standard additions mode in solution-based calibration. In order to achieve matrix matching, the <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solutions</b> (with different concentrations of analytes) were nebulized successively with a USN. Simultaneously the high-purity platinum target was ablated with a focused laser beam during solution calibration with the USN. The mass spectrometric method developed was validated using a platinum standard reference material (NIST SRM 681). The analytical results of the LA-ICP-MS of SRM 681 Platinum are in good agreement with the certified values. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of most elements (n= 3) is between 2 and 10 %. The proposed analysis method can be applied for other high-purity materials in a similar way, e. g., for trace and ultra{{trace analysis}} of high-purity metals, semiconductors and insulators such as high-purity ceramics...|$|R

The pit samples collected from a depth of 0 – 20  cm for each treatment at each selected mine dump site were taken to a laboratory and dried in an oven at 450  °C for 48  h. The concentrations of heavy metals (Mn 2 +, Cr 2 +, Pb 2 +, Fe 3 + and Cd 2 +) in the samples were determined following the procedures described by Jiang et al. 2011 [14]. The heavy metal concentrations were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer Varian Spectr AA 200 in acetylene–air flame with GTA 100 atomiser (Labequip, Canada). The digested samples of soil were simultaneously prepared with blank sample contents of distilled water through the complete procedure, analysed and then used for correction of the analytical signals. Working standard solutions were prepared by suitable dilution (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5  ppm) of the ICP <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solution</b> supplied by Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany).

As a prerequisite for the routine analysis of natural inclusions in our laboratory, the precision and accuracy of the technique was assessed using sets of multi-element synthetic fluid inclusions. Five <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solutions</b> were prepared, and incorporated as fluid inclusions in quartz crystals at 750 °C and 7 kbar. Fluid inclusions were ablated with a 193 nm ArF excimer laser and analyzed with a quadrupole ICP-MS, equipped with an octopole reaction cell {{for the removal of}} Ar-based interferences. The internal standard used in all cases was Na. Analytical precision for K, Rb, and Cs is typically better than 15 % RSD, whereas Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cl analyses are typically reproducible within 30 % RSD. Measured concentrations approximate a Gaussian distribution, suggesting that analytical errors are random. Analyses for most elements are accurate within 15 %. Limits of detection vary widely according to inclusion volume, but are 1 to 100 μfor most elements. These figures of merit are in excellent agreement with previous studies. We also demonstrate that, over the range investigated, precision and accuracy are insensitive to inclusion size and depth. Finally, the combination of our LA-ICP-MS analyses with microthermometric data shows that charge-balancing to NaCl-H 2 O equivalent chloride molality is the most valid approach to LA-ICP-MS data reduction, where chloride-dominated fluid inclusions are concerned...|$|R
40|$|Context: There is accumulating {{evidence}} that the metabolism of several trace elements like Cr, Cu, Pb, Cd, Co, Mn and Zn might have specific roles in the pathogenesis and progress of many diseases like hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Objectives: To provide a fast, efficient, sensitive, and reliable analytical procedure for trace element determination in urine samples of HTN and DM patients using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Setting and Design: The ICP-OES operating conditions were optimised and carefully selected in order to maximise the sensitivity, precision and accuracy. Factors affecting analytical and biological variability of the concentrations under study were discussed and carefully optimised. Materials and Methods: Different digestion procedures with acids and oxidising reagents were tested. The suitable procedure ICP-OES was selected, carefully modified and applied. The validity and accuracy of the different elements were determined by spiking of samples with known amounts of <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solution.</b> Statistical Analysis: Student t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test were used for analysis. Microsoft Excel {{was used to assess}} the significance of the difference between variables. The concentrations obtained were expressed as mean value ± standard deviation (P = 0. 05). Results: The results of this study showed that the mean concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr and Mn in urine from both HTN (study group A) and DM (study group B) patients were higher than the corresponding values observed in the control group. However, while the mean value of Co was low as compared to the control group, the differences found were not significant (P = 0. 05). Conclusion: The method used had excellent sensitivity, multi-element data could be obtained with very short acquisition time. The elements Cr, Cd, Pb and Zn might have specific roles in the pathogenesis and progress of HTN and DM. Further studies are required to investigate the possible roles of these elements in HTN and DM individuals...|$|R

Instrument start-up and optimization were carried out as detailed in the operating manual. Average values of three replicates were taken for each determination. Arsenic concentrations were determined using atomic absorption/flame emission spectrophotometer (Shimadzu AA- 660 GPC). Calibration curve was drawn by running suitable concentrations of standard solutions, from which the concentrations of the elements were obtained by extrapolation.

The samples were introduced into the system using a Bruker SPS 3 autosampler and an OneFast flow injection inlet system. The basic parameters were as follows: radiofrequency power 1.40  kW; plasma gas flow rate 15.50  L min− 1; auxiliary gas flow rate 1.65  L min− 1; sheath gas flow rate 0.12  L min− 1; nebulizer gas flow rate 1.00  L min− 1. The following isotopes were measured without skimmer gas: Mg 24, Al 27, Ca 44, Mn 55, Zn 66, Sr 88, Ba 137 and a combination of Pb isotopes (Pb 206, Pb 207 and Pb 208). The CRI Reaction System was activated for Cu and Fe because of interferences with polyatomic species produced {{by a combination of}} isotopes from the argon plasma, reagents and the bone matrix. Fe 56 was measured with hydrogen as skimmer gas and Cu 63 with helium as skimmer gas. A mixture of Sc 45, Y 89 and Tb 159 was used as internal standard and added continuously to all samples. The dwell time on each peak was between 5 and 20  ms. Five replicate {{analyses were}} made of each of the dissolved bone samples and each replicate consisted of 30 mass scans. ICP <b>multi-element</b> standard <b>solution</b> XXI for MS (Merck) were prepared in 1 % HNO 3 at 6 different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 20, 100 and 200  μg L− 1), but for each element only 3 of the standards were selected to fit the appropriate concentration range in the samples. For the main element Ca three standards (Fluka TraceCert® ICP Standard) of concentrations 10, 20 and 25  wt% were used. Elements showing higher than expected concentrations had their count rates attenuated automatically in the detector. A sample of water and a blank sample consisting of 1 % HNO 3 were run before the standard blank to ensure that no pollution was lingering in the system at start up. A blank sample was analysed between each bone sample in order to rinse the system and avoid any memory effects. Each working day an in-house standard sample made of a homogenized medieval bone was analysed along with the samples in order to monitor the overall performance. Together with the samples was run an international standard sample, NIST SRM- 1486, a modern bone sample. For these modern samples more H 2 O 2 had to be added.|$|R
