Of the remaining 3 systems, two (γ Per and HR 8242) have a markedly `over-evolved' secondary, our explanation being that the primary component is the merged remnant of a former short-period sub-binary in a former triple system. The last system (V 695 Cyg) defies any agreement at present. Mention is also made of three other systems (V 643 Ori, OW Gem and V 453 Cep), which are relevant to our discussion...|$|R

In one case, evidence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> has been found. We investigate the effects of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> on the evolution of rotating (υ_ ini= 200 km s^- 1) 10 M_ stellar models at solar metallicity during the main-sequence (MS) phase. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> process is included in our stellar models according to the formalism deduced from 2 D MHD simulations of magnetic wind confinement by ud-Doula and co-workers. Various assumptions are made regarding both the magnitude of the magnetic field and of the efficiency of the angular momentum transport mechanisms in the stellar interior. When <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> occurs in models with differential rotation, a strong and rapid mixing is obtained {{at the surface}} accompanied by a rapid decrease in the surface velocity. Such a process might account for some MS stars showing strong mixing and low surface velocities. When solid-body rotation is imposed in the interior, the star is slowed down so rapidly that surface enrichments are smaller than in similar models with no <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> In both kinds of models (differentially or uniformly rotating), <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> due to a field of a few 100 G significantly reduces the angular momentum of the core during the MS phase.

The throwing mechanism consists of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder, which was developed to overcome the problems of the internal pressure fall of the pneumatic cylinder when moving light loads. However, the first <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder designed does not have the necessary structure and mechanism to provide control over the child machine’s throwing distance.

40|$|Sco X- 1 is the {{brightest}} persistent X-ray in the sky. It is generally believed that Sco X- 1 is a low-mass X-ray binary containing {{a neutron star}} accreting from a low-mass donor star where mass transfer {{is driven by the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> However, the mass transfer rate predicted by the standard <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> model is at least one order of magnitude lower than the one inferred by X-ray luminosity. In this work, we investigate whether this source could evolved from an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including Ap/Bp stars with a slightly strong magnetic field of 300 - 1000 G. The coupling between the magnetic field and an irradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accretor can yield a strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> which could give rise to a relatively high mass transfer rate. According to the observed orbital period, the mass transfer rate, the mass ratio, and the donor star spectral type, the progenitor of Sco X- 1 should be an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including a 1. 6 - 1. 8 M_ Ap/Bp donor star in a 1. 3 - 1. 5 day orbit. Therefore, we propose that anomalous <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> of Ap/Bp stars provides an alternative evolutionary channel to a part of luminous X-ray sources.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field plays {{a central role}} in the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks. The {{magnetic field}} connects the rapidly rotating central region with the outer envelope and extracts angular momentum from the central region during gravitational collapse of the cloud core. This process is known as <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> Both analytical and multidimensional simulations have shown that disk formation is strongly suppressed by <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> in moderately magnetized cloud cores in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit. On the other hand, recent observations have provided growing evidence of a relatively large disk several tens of astronomical units in size existing in some Class 0 young stellar objects. This introduces a serious discrepancy between the theoretical study and observations. Various physical mechanisms have been proposed to solve the problem of catastrophic <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> such as misalignment between the magnetic field and the rotation axis, turbulence, and non-ideal effect. In this paper, we review the mechanism of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> its effect on disk formation and early evolution, and the mechanisms that resolve the <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> problem. In particular, we emphasize the importance of non-ideal effects. The combination of magnetic diffusion and thermal evolution during gravitational collapse provides a robust formation process for the circumstellar disk at the very early phase of protostar formation. The rotation induced by the Hall effect can supply a sufficient amount of angular momentum for typical circumstellar disks around T Tauri stars. By examining the combination of the suggested mechanisms, we conclude that the circumstellar disks commonly form in the very early phase of protostar formation.

40|$|Differential {{rotation}} in stars generates toroidal {{magnetic fields}} whenever an initial seed poloidal field is present. The resulting magnetic stresses, along with viscosity, drive the star toward uniform rotation. This <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> has important dynamical consequences in many astrophysical contexts. For example, merging binary neutron stars can form "hypermassive" remnants supported against collapse by differential rotation. The removal of this support by <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> induces radial fluid motion, {{which can lead}} to delayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole. We explore the effects of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> and viscosity on the structure of a differentially rotating, compressible star, generalizing our earlier calculations for incompressible configurations. The star is idealized as a differentially rotating, infinite cylinder supported initially by a polytropic equation of state. The gas is assumed to be infinitely conducting and our calculations are performed in Newtonian gravitation. Though highly idealized, our model allows for the incorporation of magnetic fields, viscosity, compressibility, and shocks with minimal computational resources in a 1 + 1 dimensional Lagrangian MHD code. Our evolution calculations show that <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> can lead to significant structural changes in a star, including quasistatic contraction of the core and ejection of matter in the outermost regions to form a wind or an ambient disk. These calculations serve as a prelude and a guide to more realistic MHD simulations in full 3 + 1 general relativity. Comment: 20 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables, AASTeX, accepted by Ap...|$|R

In this paper we present a new method for the analysis of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> using a magnet fixed to the glider of an air track. The forces acting on the glider, a result of the eddy currents, can be easily observed and measured. As a consequence of the air track inclination, the glider accelerates at the beginning, although it asymptotically tends towards a uniform rectilinear movement characterized by a terminal speed. This speed depends on the interaction between the magnetic field and the conductivity properties of the air track. Compared with previous related approaches, in our experimental setup the magnet fixed to the glider produces a <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> force which acts continuously, rather than over a short period of time. The experimental results satisfactorily concur with the theoretical models adapted to this configuration. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
