5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E

The Athenians general Chares {{was already in the}} vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> difficult by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} crisis, the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) took drastic measures: Khurasan was {{separated}} from {{the purview of the}} governor of Iraq and raised to a separate province, under the Jaziran general Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami. Like his predecessor, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, Ashras tried to win over the loyalties of the local population and the native, non-Arab converts to Islam (mawali), by addressing some of their grievances on taxation. Soon, however, this policy was reversed—possibly due to pressure from the Caliph himself—and the often brutal measures the Arab tax-gatherers employed to gather the taxes from the mawali and the local landed aristocracy (dihqans) led to a general revolt in Transoxiana. This was <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> dangerous to the Arabs due to the rebels' call for assistance to the Turgesh ruler, the khagan, who replied by leading his army in person against the Arabs. By the time the khagan entered the field in 728, only Samarkand and the two fortresses of Kamarja and Dabusiyya on the Zarafshan River remained in Arab hands in all of Transoxiana.|$|E

5|$|Rivalries were renewed in 1999–2000 {{following}} Manchester City's promotion back to {{the second}} tier. Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road {{for the first time}} in history (1999–2000) thanks to goals from former City youngster Alan Bailey and County legend Tony Dinning. Manchester City were famously defeated once more by Stockport County in 2001–02, when 2 late goals from John Hardiker handed bottom of the table Stockport victory, and in the process City were prevented from gaining 100 points in their quest for the Division One title. Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002, with Stockport County winning three times, losing once and drawing twice. The defeats suffered at the hands of County clearly touched a raw nerve with many Manchester City supporters, some of whom have celebrated County's downfall on the 'bluemoon' forum. The rivalry with City is <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complex by the fact that Stockport is a hotbed for Manchester City support.|$|E

25|$|On March 4, 1991, Francis {{was traded}} to the Pittsburgh Penguins, along with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings, in {{exchange}} for John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski and Jeff Parker. Francis {{was one of the most}} popular players on the team, and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise's history, both in the WHA and NHL. The trade was condemned by Whalers fans, most of whom were not willing to believe The Hockey News assessment that the Whalers had actually received the better end of the bargain. Less than two weeks after the trade, Parker suffered a career-ending knee injury. The Francis trade was <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> painful when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles.

25|$|Michelangelo {{takes all}} Brunelleschi’s {{components}} and bends {{them to his}} will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what Pevsner refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> so because {{the rise of the}} stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.|$|E
25|$|With no {{contract}} for 2004, Villeneuve {{was forced to}} take a sabbatical, but maintained {{that he wanted to}} return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French Renault team. Jarno Trulli had fallen out of favour and team boss Flavio Briatore felt Villeneuve would be worth a gamble. Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming Fernando Alonso as teammate his task was <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> difficult. The young Spaniard proved faster. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for Sauber, starting in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{season was}} <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> special {{following}} Shawn Redhage's announcement that the 2016/17 season {{would be his}} last in the NBL. When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals {{for the first time in}} 31 years seemed like a real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name—380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)—while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Evans: Gerry is {{initially}} portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon {{his first appearance}} in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, {{in sharp contrast to}} the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael's narration, we learn that Gerry is later left with a limp after falling off a motorbike in Barcelona. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry seems particularly inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in doubt. We learn later that he secretly has another family back in Wales, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry's death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.|$|E
25|$|Born in Cobh, County Cork, O'Sullivan's {{first major}} {{international}} competition was the 1990 European Championships at Split, where she finished 11th in the 3000 m. However, O'Sullivan improved quickly after that, and on 26 January the following year, at Boston, she {{set a new}} world indoor record in the 5000 m of 15:17.28, taking more than 5 seconds off the old record. At the time, O'Sullivan (who attained a sporting scholarship) was studying accountancy at the Villanova University in the USA, and at the World Student Games at Sheffield in July 1991, she won the 1500 m Gold Medal in 4:12.14, and the Silver Medal in the 3000 m in 8:56.55. At the start of 1992, she finished 7th in the World Cross Country Championships. In 1992, O'Sullivan improved her personal bests {{in a number of}} distances between 800 m and 5000 m, setting six Irish national records in the process, including five in the space of 11 days in mid-August following the Barcelona Olympic Games. At Barcelona, in the 3000 m final, O'Sullivan was always in contention, and hit the lead in the back straight on the final lap, but she was eventually outsprinted and finished fourth. Narrowly missing out on an Olympic medal was <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> frustrating when the silver medalist from the race Tatyana Dorovskikh tested positive for a banned substance the following year. In the 1500 m, she finished only 11th in her semi-final and did not qualify for the final. She finished 1992 by winning the Grand Prix Final for the 5000 m.|$|E

25|$|Protestantism also {{spread from}} the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin {{continued}} {{to take an}} interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes, promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam, giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{investment}} in players followed in successive seasons, and results began {{to match the}} upturn in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, their first major final in over thirty years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final, {{the first time they}} had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time since}} 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage. Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned half-way through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their bitter rivals with only six games left to play, an unprecedented slump by the previous champions allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they still managed to fall a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time - including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed - resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history. The game was only <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> notable for former player Joey Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of only a few seconds, resulting in a 12-game ban which effectively forced him to leave English football.|$|E
