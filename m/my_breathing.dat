5000|$|In May 2010, friends {{reported}} that Orlovsky, {{who had had}} lung cancer for several months, was moved {{from his home in}} St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to the Vermont Respite House in Williston. He died there on May 30, 2010, from complications of the disease; he was seventy-six years old. He was buried alongside one third of Ginsberg's ashes in Shambhala Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado.

60|$|So now I took careful aim {{between its}} eyes; my right fingers closed firmly and evenly upon {{the small of}} the stock, drawing back my trigger-finger by the muscular action of the hand. The bullet could not fail to hit its mark! I held my breath lest I swerve the muzzle a hair by <b>my</b> <b>breathing.</b> I was as steady and cool as I ever had been upon a target-range, and I had the full {{consciousness}} of a perfect hit in anticipation; I knew that I could not miss.

60|$|Though {{my right}} hand is so much swollen that I can {{scarcely}} keep my pen steady between my thumb and finger, yet my stomach is easy, and <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> comfortable, and I am eager to hope all good things of my health. That gained, I have a cheering, and I trust prideless confidence that I shall make an active, and perseverant use of the faculties and requirements that have been entrusted to my keeping, and a fair trial of their height, depth, and width. Indeed I {{look back on the}} last four months with honest pride, seeing how much I have done, with what steady attachment of mind to the same subject, and under what vexations and sorrows, from without, and amid what incessant sufferings. So much of myself. When I know more, I will tell you more.|$|E
60|$|I {{put myself}} at once under {{the hands of}} the priest. He brought out the chloroform, and placed it beneath my nostrils, as I lay on a soft couch under the central court. Hatasou held my hand in hers, and watched <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> with an anxious eye. I saw the priest leaning over me, with a clouded phial in his hand, and I {{experienced}} a vague sensation of smelling myrrh and spikenard. Next, I lost myself for a few moments, and when I again recovered my senses in a temporary break, the priest was holding a small greenstone knife, dabbled with blood, and I felt that a gash had been made across my breast. Then they applied the chloroform once more; I felt Hatasou give my hand a gentle squeeze; the whole panorama faded finally from my view; and I went to sleep for a seemingly endless time.|$|E
60|$|I {{took his}} pocket-book and the revolver, being {{resolved}} rather to die {{than to be}} captured, and laden besides with the basket and the bag of gems, set forward towards the north. The swamp, at that hour of the night, {{was filled with a}} continuous din: animals and insects of all kinds, and all inimical to life, contributing their parts. Yet {{in the midst of this}} turmoil of sound, I walked as though my eyes were bandaged, beholding nothing. The soil sank under my foot, with a horrid, slippery consistence, as though I were walking among toads; the touch of the thick wall of foliage, by which alone I guided myself, affrighted me like the touch of serpents; the darkness checked <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> like a gag; indeed, I have never suffered such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk, nor have I ever known a more sensible relief than when I found the path beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot, and saw, although still some way in front of me, the silver brightness of the moon.|$|E

60|$|My {{sister-in-law}} {{was also}} {{presented to the}} Queen, who filled her with ecstasy by making her some compliment on the services of M. la Comte d'Aubepine, and thus began our career at court. We were in favour, and <b>my</b> mother <b>breathed</b> freely.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was sitting}} up, two masses of tawny hair fell {{on each side}} of her tense face. I threw away the pillows from which she had risen and sat down behind her on the couch. “Perhaps like this,” I suggested, drawing her head gently on my breast. She didn’t resist, she didn’t even sigh, she didn’t look at me or attempt to settle herself in any way. It was I who settled her after taking up a {{position}} which I thought I should be able to keep for hours—for ages. After a time I grew composed enough to become aware of the ticking of the clock, even to take pleasure in it. The beat recorded the moments of her rest, while I sat, keeping as still as if my life depended upon it with my eyes fixed idly on the arrow of gold gleaming and glittering dimly on the table under the lowered gas-jet. And presently <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> fell into the quiet rhythm of the sleep which descended on her at last.

60|$|I had {{not been}} half an hour in London before I had run my head against an Act of Parliament! What a hopeless adventure! However, the barocco apostle was a {{resourceful}} person in his way, and we managed to get round the hard letter of it without damage to its fine spirit. Yet, strictly speaking, {{it was not the}} conduct of a good citizen; and in retrospect there is an unfilial flavour about that early sin of mine. For this Act of Parliament, the Merchant Shipping Act of the Victorian era, had been {{in a manner of speaking}} a father and mother to me. For many years it had regulated and disciplined my life, prescribed my food and the amount of <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> space, had looked after my health and tried as much as possible to secure my personal safety in a risky calling. It isn't such a bad thing to lead a life of hard toil and plain duty within the four corners of an honest Act of Parliament. And I am glad to say that its seventies have never been applied to me.|$|E

The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop <b>my</b> <b>breathing.</b> In another moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: [...] "They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way." [...] Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world.|$|E

60|$|Nothing can {{describe}} {{the confusion of}} thought which I felt when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could before another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon found {{it was impossible to}} avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water if I could; and so, by swimming, to preserve <b>my</b> <b>breathing,</b> and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my greatest concern now being that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.|$|E

I pulled up, therefore, and had dismounted to take my observations, when my brute of a charger gave the bridle a twitch, jerked itself free, and was off in an instant over hedges and ditches. I had, therefore, only my good sword left to trust to. I climbed up the ladder, and was engaged in planning how the defence could best be conducted, when I heard the clank of hoofs, and on the top of it you did ascend from below. I retired at once into ambush, from which I should assuredly have made a sudden outfall or sally, had the flour not so choked <b>my</b> <b>breathing</b> that I felt as though I had a two-pound loaf stuck in my gizzard. For myself, I am glad that it has so come about, for in my blind wrath I might unwittingly have done you an injury.
