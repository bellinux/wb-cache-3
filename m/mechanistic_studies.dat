25|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. <b>Mechanistic</b> <b>studies</b> of reductions employing metal amalgams as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and the more stable organic radical occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from the more stable radical. Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.|$|E
25|$|Prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase) catalyzes the {{cleavage}} of prenylcysteine (a protein modification) {{to form an}} isoprenoid aldehyde and the freed cysteine residue on {{the protein}} target. The FAD is non-covalently bound to PCLase. Not many <b>mechanistic</b> <b>studies</b> have been done looking at the reactions of the flavin, but the proposed mechanism is shown below. It is proposed {{that there is a}} hydride transfer from the C1 of the prenyl moiety to FAD that results in the reduction of the flavin to FADH2 and the formation of a carbocation that is stabilized by the neighboring sulfur atom. FADH2 then reacts with molecular oxygen to restore the oxidized enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Mechanism: In the future, further {{investigation}} of the precise steps involved in the mechanism of hydrogen bond catalysis will be required that will enable chemists to rationally design catalytic strategies for more complex or more useful transformations. For comparison, the basic steps of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling have been systematically and thoroughly studied {{over the last few}} decades and have led to dramatic advances in catalytic scope, control and reaction design principles. For example, improved understanding of oxidative addition has led to aryl chlorides becoming practical coupling partners, while improved understanding of reductive elimination has {{led to the development of}} new reactions involving sp3 centers. Knowing these fundamental catalytic steps, the ability to rationally plan new reactions and cascades has been extremely useful in the field of total synthesis. In contrast, we lack a general, systematic mechanistic understanding of the steps of hydrogen bond catalysis and how to influence them. Detailed <b>mechanistic</b> <b>studies</b> have so far been limited to individual systems, and their findings have not been of demonstrable predictive use.|$|E

25|$|Although current {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} {{in a controlled}} hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, {{to be used as a}} bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. <b>Mechanistic</b> <b>studies</b> may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E

However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern. Lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Microbial cytochromes P450 {{are often}} soluble enzymes and are {{involved}} in diverse metabolic processes. In bacteria the distribution of P450s is very variable with many bacteria having no identified P450s (e.g. E.coli). Some bacteria, predominantly actinomycetes, have numerous P450s (e.g.,). Those so far identified are generally involved in either biotransformation of xenobiotic compounds (e.g. CYP105A1 from Streptomyces griseolus metabolizes sulfonylurea herbicides to less toxic derivatives,) or are part of specialised metabolite biosynthetic pathways (e.g. CYP170B1 catalyses production of the sesquiterpenoid albaflavenone in Streptomyces albus,). Although no P450 has yet {{been shown to be}} essential in a microbe, the CYP105 family is highly conserved with a representative in every streptomycete genome sequenced so far (...) [...] [...] Due to the solubility of bacterial P450 enzymes, they are generally regarded as easier to work with than the predominantly membrane bound eukaryotic P450s. This, combined with the remarkable chemistry they catalyse, has led to many studies using the heterologously expressed proteins in vitro. Few studies have investigated what P450s do in vivo, what the natural substrate(s) are and how P450s contribute to survival of the bacteria in the natural environment.Three examples that have contributed significantly to structural and <b>mechanistic</b> <b>studies</b> are listed here, but many different families exist.|$|E
