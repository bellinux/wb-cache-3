5|$|He {{was unable}} to reclaim his Test place in 195253 despite making 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests. Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 {{dismissals}} in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match. His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane, making fun of the <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> by Tallon's replacement Gil Langley in particular.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} national anthem was in the key of G major, but in 1983, schools were issued an educational tape describing common <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in F major. (It was the very version that was first demonstrated to the public during the 1986 Singapore National Day Parade.) In 1993, the shorter version of Majulah Singapura was declared to be the official one.|$|E

5|$|While {{agreeing on}} most basic facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the {{accident}} investigation, arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes the accident was caused by <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> both by air traffic controllers and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed {{on a collision course}} by the air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{errors are}} {{attributed}} to <b>mistakes</b> <b>made</b> by individuals who may be penalized for these mistakes.

While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors.|$|E
