25|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>finishing</b> is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. <b>Mass</b> <b>finishing</b> can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E

The aim of {{this paper}} is to introduce, in broad strokes, a {{framework}} – constructed from a fusion of granular flow (GFD) dynamics, tribology and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques – for the practical analysis of <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> processes. The presentation opens with a short introduction to typical <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> processes, followed by a brief discussion on their respective correspondences to GFD regimes, and ends which some illustrative results arising from the application of this framework to vibratory finishing, which is perhaps the most industrially pervasive <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> process...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} fundamental concept of material removal by scratches made by ceramic media on metallic coupon {{as the basis}} for material removal by <b>Mass</b> <b>Finishing</b> process. <b>Mass</b> <b>Finishing</b> is a group o f surface improvement operations such as polishing, descaling, burnishing, cleaning, and drying. Polishing, descaling, and burnishing are abrasive operations that remove or displace material on parts being processed to attain the expected effect. These material removal operations were idealized as a sequence o f scratches. A series of experiments for generating scratches were conducted using an abrasive sphere on a flat polished surface of three distinct materials. The abrasive tool is a spherical ceramic piece with a surface roughness of 3. 7 pm and a diameter of 14. 288 mm, and the materials for the scratch test are steel, brass, and aluminum, with their surfaces polished to a finish better than 0. 1 pm. Physical properties of these materials such as yield strength, strain hardening coefficient, and strength coefficient were measured. Empirical relationships for the width and depth o f the scratch with respect to process and material characteristics were developed using dimensional analysis. The theoretical output from these relationships showed a close match with the physical data obtained from experiments. This indicated that the dimensional analysis technique is a viable tool for use in this aspect of <b>Mass</b> <b>Finishing</b> research...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>{{finishing}}</b> is {{amongst the}} most widely used finishing processes in modern manufacturing, in applications from deburring to edge radiusing and polishing. Processing objectives are varied, ranging from the cosmetic to the functionally critical. One such critical application is the hydraulically smooth polishing of aero engine component gas-washed surfaces. In this, and many other applications the drive to improve process control and finish tolerance is ever present. Considering its widespread use <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> has seen limited research activity, particularly with respect to surface characterization. The objectives of the current paper are to; characterise the mass finished stratified surface and its development process using areal surface parameters, provide guidance on the optimal parameters and sampling method to characterise this surface type for a given application, and detail the spatial variation in surface topography due to coupon edge shadowing. Blasted and peened square plate coupons in titanium alloy are wet (vibro) mass finished iteratively with increasing duration. Measurement fields are precisely relocated between iterations by fixturing and an image superimposition alignment technique. Surface topography development is detailed with ‘log of process duration’ plots of the ‘areal parameters for scale-limited stratified functional surfaces’, (the Sk family). Characteristic features of the Smr 2 plot are seen to map out the processing of peak, core and dale regions in turn. These surface process regions also become apparent in the ‘log of process duration’ plot for Sq, where lower core and dale regions are well modelled by logarithmic functions. Surface finish (Ra or Sa) with <b>mass</b> <b>finishing</b> duration is currently predicted with an exponential model. This model is shown to be limited for the current surface type at a critical range of surface finishes. Statistical analysis provides a group of areal parameters including; Vvc, Sq, and Sdq, showing optimal discrimination for a specific range of surface finish outcomes. As a consequence of edge shadowing surface segregation is suggested for characterization purposes...|$|E
