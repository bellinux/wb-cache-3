500|$|In {{contrast}} to the violent nature of the verses, the emergence of major chords creates a feeling of hope during Bono's [...] "How long, how long <b>must</b> <b>we</b> sing this song?" [...] refrain. During the chorus, the Edge's backing vocals further develop this tread, using a harmonic imitative echo. The snare drum is absent from this section, and the guitar parts are muted. This part of the song deviates musically from the raw aggression seen in the song's verses and gives the song a more uplifting structure. Bono once commented that [...] "love is...a central theme" [...] of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" ...|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, Smallville's Clark Kent was {{a better}} {{representation}} of the original material and remained [...] "true {{to the heart of}} the story" [...] by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told: [...] "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why <b>must</b> <b>we</b> endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?" ...|$|E

500|$|Burton {{was still}} {{interested}} in Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian in early 1991. Impressed with Daniel Waters' work on Heathers, Burton approached {{him for a}} rewrite. However, he eventually signed Waters to write the script for Batman Returns. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite. Warner Bros. approached Kevin Smith in 1996 to rewrite the script, though Smith turned down the offer in favor of Superman Lives. Smith later joked that his response was [...] "Didn't we say all we needed {{to say in the}} first Beetlejuice? <b>Must</b> <b>we</b> go tropical?" [...] In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying [...] "The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it." ...|$|E

We have enough ill-will and prejudice to cope with. <b>Must</b> <b>we</b> hasten to create further fissiparous forces?" ...|$|E
2500|$|He concludes {{the volume}} by setting out {{the limits of}} {{knowledge}} once and for all. [...] "When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc <b>must</b> <b>we</b> make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tamla Motown Records: Motown's non-US label, {{established}} in March 1965 and folded into the regular Motown label in 1976. Distributed by EMI, Tamla Motown issued the releases on the American Motown labels, using its own numbering system. In some cases, Tamla Motown would issue singles and albums not {{released in the}} United States (for example, the singles [...] "I Second That Emotion" [...] and [...] "Why (<b>Must</b> <b>We</b> Fall in Love)" [...] by Diana Ross & the Supremes with the Temptations, {{as well as the}} successful Motown Chartbusters series of albums).|$|E

2500|$|Simone de Beauvoir (in {{her essay}} <b>Must</b> <b>we</b> burn Sade?, {{published}} in Les Temps modernes, December 1951 and January 1952) and other writers {{have attempted to}} locate traces of a radical philosophy of freedom in Sade's writings, preceding modern existentialism by some 150 years. He has also {{been seen as a}} precursor of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis in his focus on sexuality as a motive force. The surrealists admired him as one of their forerunners, and Guillaume Apollinaire famously called him [...] "the freest spirit that has yet existed".|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Getty's father died. Over {{the next}} decade Getty {{suffered}} from depression and, in a final attempt to end his drug addiction, checked himself into a London clinic in 1984. While there he received {{a visit from the}} then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to thank him for large donations to the National Gallery. She reportedly helped speed his recovery by telling him, [...] "My dear Mr. Getty, we mustn't let things get us down, <b>must</b> <b>we?</b> We'll have you out of here as soon as possible." [...] During a low period in the 1970s Getty had been cheered up by the former England cricketer and later President of the MCC, Gubby Allen, having previously been introduced to the game by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Piano Sonata (1947–48) is {{a half-hour}} work of extreme virtuosity. Its four {{movements}} follow the standard pattern of a classical sonata but {{in each of}} them Boulez subverts the traditional model. Of the two middle movements Boulez said: “I tried to disintegrate slow movement form {{by the use of}} the trope, and repetitive scherzo form by the use of variation form.” He characterised this as a deliberate attack on Schoenberg’s attempts in his later music to revive older forms. For Griffiths the violent character of much of the music “is not just superficial: it is expressive of a whole aesthetic of annihilation, and in particular of a need to obliterate what had gone before.” When Boulez played the work for Copland, the older composer asked [...] "But <b>must</b> <b>we</b> start a revolution all over again?"—"Mais oui," [...] Boulez replied, [...] "sans pitié".|$|E

And <b>we</b> <b>must</b> do so in a world in which <b>we</b> <b>must</b> compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children.|$|R
2500|$|Ruth Fischer {{argued that}} the Communist Party of Germany leaders were saying: [...] "In no {{circumstances}} <b>must</b> <b>we</b> proclaim the general strike. The bourgeoisie will discover our plans and destroy us before we have moved. On the contrary, we must calm the masses, hold back our people in the factories and the unemployed committees until the government thinks the moment of danger has passed." [...] In April 1924 the 9th party convention elected her and Maslow co-chairpersons of the Communist Party of Germany. Both criticised by Joseph Stalin, Fischer, intending to defend Maslow (meanwhile arrested for participation in preparing an uprising in Germany planned for 1923), travelled to Moscow arriving there in September 1925 and was held for the following ten months in the Hotel Lux. Meanwhile Ernst Thälmann replaced Fischer and Maslow. Joseph Stalin arranged {{for them to be}} expelled from the party in August 1926.|$|E
2500|$|Men of the Lightship {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} that happened to the East Dudgeon lightship on 29 January 1940. The Ministry of Information decided to use this event for propaganda purposes, to portray Germany as a barbaric enemy and thus encourage support of the war effort against them. The film ends with the narrator concluding: [...] "The Nazis must be stopped. We <b>must,</b> <b>we</b> can, we will stop them." [...] Central to this propaganda aim of the film is the idea that the German aircraft are violating the traditional wartime convention that lightships should be protected as neutral, as they are undefended ships that serve all vessels regardless of the nationality of their crew. Another propaganda theme supported by Men of the Lightship is that of sacrifices for the war effort being made by ordinary working class citizens. To support this end, the characters in the film are developed to show their everyday concerns and activities, including the upcoming wedding of one crew member, and the pet tortoise owned by another.|$|E
2500|$|By 1913 {{he had in}} {{his spare}} time, using calculus, {{developed}} the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. His first goal was to build a sounding rocket with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that [...] "n no case <b>must</b> <b>we</b> allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may." ...|$|E

Oh, uncle! we were very wrong. When he was here with us we should have taken him then; we should have shut him up; we should have sailed with him to Kingston." ...|$|R
