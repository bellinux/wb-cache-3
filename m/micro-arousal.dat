40|$|Introduction The use of {{non-invasive}} ventilation in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is among the main therapeutic options for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Yet the effects of CPAP obtained on the first night of use are underreported. Objective To evaluate the acute effects of CPAP on polysomnographic variables in patients with OSA. Materials and methods This study is a case series with 31 patients (55. 8 &# 177; 11. 4 years; 22 men) in the initial phase of CPAP treatment. The subjects were evaluated by means of polysomnography with and without CPAP (10. 2 &# 177; 3. 1 cmH 2 O) and without CPAP, on different days, by means of the following variables: sleep stages 1, 2 and 3 (N 1, N 2 and N 3), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, apnea and hypopnea index (AHI), AHI in REM sleep (AHIREM) and the <b>micro-arousal</b> index (MAI). Results The use of CPAP resulted in a reduction of N 2 (p < 0. 001), AHI (p < 0. 001), AHIREM (p < 0. 001) and MAI (p = 0. 001). There was an increase in N 3 (p = 0. 006) and REM sleep (p < 0. 001) during the night with use of CPAP. Conclusion This study demonstrated that, from the first night of use by patients with OSA, CPAP promotes greater balance between sleep phases, and improves sleep quality. These results should be presented to patients and their families in order to encourage greater adherence in the initial phase of treatment with CPAP...|$|E
40|$|Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) can {{reflect the}} changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that are affected by apnea or hypopnea events among patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). To evaluate the possibility of using HRV to screen for OSAHS, we investigated the relationship between HRV and polysomnography (PSG) diagnostic indices using electrocardiography (ECG) and PSG data from 25 patients with OSAHS and 27 healthy participants. We evaluated the relationship between various PSG diagnostic indices (including the apnea hypopnea index [AHI], <b>micro-arousal</b> index [MI], oxygen desaturation index [ODI]) and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters using Spearman's correlation analysis. Moreover, we used multiple linear regression analyses to construct linear models for the AHI, MI, and ODI. In our analysis, the AHI was significantly associated with relative powers of very low frequency (VLF [%]) (r = 0. 641, P = 0. 001), relative powers of high frequency (HF [%]) (r = - 0. 586, P = 0. 002), ratio between low frequency and high frequency powers (LF/HF) (r = 0. 545, P = 0. 049), normalized powers of low frequency (LF [n. u. ]) (r = 0. 506, P = 0. 004), and normalized powers of high frequency (HF [n. u. ]) (r = - 0. 506, P = 0. 010) among patients with OSAHS. The MI was significantly related to standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) (r = 0. 550, P = 0. 031), VLF [%] (r = 0. 626, P = 0. 001), HF [%] (r = - 0. 632, P = 0. 001), LF/HF (r = 0. 591, P = 0. 011), LF [n. u. ] (r = 0. 553, P = 0. 004), HF [n. u. ] (r = - 0. 553, P = 0. 004), and absolute powers of very low frequency (VLF [abs]) (r = 0. 525, P = 0. 007) among patients with OSAHS. The ODI was significantly correlated with VLF [%] (r = 0. 617, P = 0. 001), HF [%] (r = - 0. 574, P = 0. 003), LF [n. u. ] (r = 0. 510, P = 0. 012), and HF [n. u. ] (r = - 0. 510, P = 0. 012) among patients with OSAHS. The linear models for the PSG diagnostic indices were AHI = - 38. 357 + 1. 318 VLF [%], MI = - 13. 389 + 11. 297 LF/HF+ 0. 266 SDNN, and ODI = - 55. 588 + 1. 715 VLF [%]. However, the PSG diagnostic indices were not related to the HRV parameters among healthy participants. Our analysis suggests that HRV parameters are powerful tools to screen for OSAHS patients in place of PSG monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{impressive}} technological advances have brought research in biosciences {{to a new}} interdisciplinary and translational dimension, in which computation has emerged as fundamental partner in scientific investigation. In this context, mathematical tools typically inherent to engineering can indeed magnify the investigation potentials of the sector specialists, allowing to efficiently exploit the stifling deluge of data and information, and finding simultaneous applications in a heterogeneous range of different fields. A clear example is provided in sleep research by the advent of high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) systems. Simultaneously recording signals from hundreds of electrodes (up to 257) distributed over the scalp highly increase the spatial resolution of the investigation but make standard analysis methods, based on visual inspection and manual scoring that have been traditionally used both in clinics and research, totally inadequate. Moreover, such techniques, in combination with novel analytical approaches, revealed previously unknown features of the sleep EEG activity, such as the local, experience-dependent regulation of particular oscillations, including so-called slow waves and spindles. These and other properties of the EEG signal that can be studied only {{through the development of}} adequate automated tools. Importantly, REM sleep, a state associated with rapid eye movements (REMs) and a “tonically activated” EEG similar to that of wakefulness, poses further methodological challenges that have limited its analysis until now. In fact, REM sleep is not a homogeneous phase but it is episodically interrupted by phasic components, including REMs, muscle twitches and micro-arousals that can generate artefactual potentials corrupting the corresponding EEG signals. This great richness of signals and features, whose functional role and reciprocal relation is still under debate, brings about the strong need of optimized and validated automated procedures, allowing to efficiently manage and decode this large amount of data. In response to the listed requirements, a multi-functional software was developed in the Matlab environment that allows automatic analysis of REM sleep high-density EEG data. The tool includes different functionalities that have been developed and validated against the visual scoring of a board certified electrophysiologist and sleep specialist, with optimal results. The first stage of the procedure allows to detect the occurrence of each elementary rapid eye movement and provides a complete characterization of ocular activity in terms of time density, aggregation tendency and directional properties (movements are in fact classified according their main direction). REMs represent a peculiar aspect of REM sleep whose physiological origin is still unclear and whose occurrence pattern has been correlated to learning processes and various psychiatric disorders. This functionality represents hence an important investigation tool both in basic REM sleep research and in clinical practice. REMs represent also one of the main sources of contamination that affect the study of cerebral activity during REM sleep. For this reason, the global procedure considers also an ocular artifact removal stage that integrates the information provided by the REMs detection algorithm to activate a correction scheme based on adaptive filtering. The capacity of the correction algorithm in reconstructing the true EEG signals was objectively evaluated by artificially simulating the propagation of ocular potentials, showing how the proposed artifact removal procedure reaches greatly improved performance with respect to standard methods based on adaptive filters only. Finally, the toolbox includes an EEG activation detection algorithm that precisely identifies abrupt and relative shifts in the EEG instantaneous frequency, potentially reflecting cortical desynchronization events. Growing experimental evidence has in fact suggested that the electrophysiological features of both sleep and wake can appear in an extremely local manner independently from the global vigilance state of the brain. In order to potentially detect also localized activations, the algorithm is intended to work independently channel by channel, automatically adapting to the different features of signals, without strong a priori assumptions about the frequencies involved in the activation, but always detecting frequency increases relative to the current background. Since standard clinical criteria assume that EEG activation must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in EMG activity for the identification of a <b>micro-arousal,</b> also an EMG activation detection procedure was herein developed, in order to compare the properties of micro-arousals and the detected localized EEG activations. After the development, the different stages of the REM sleep toolbox listed above were applied to various sets of overnight high-density recordings, in order to characterize the REM electrophysiological features, to gain further insight into their functional meaning. Mathematical details of the algorithms are described in the first section. Toolbox functionalities are based on several signal processing techniques that go thought Fourier and wavelet transform, adaptive filtering to non linear instantaneous energy estimators, and allowed to automatically extract significant information from a great amount of data. However, mathematical tools, and in particular dynamical models, {{can also be used to}} integrate the available data and current knowledge in order to predict the system future states. In epidemiological research, this model-based approach is an often used and valuable tool [...] Herein, we provide an example of a further evolution of this approach, in which we apply optimal control to a realistically parameterized age-structured model for the Varicella-Zoster-Virus transmission to investigate whether feasible varicella immunizations paths that are optimal in controlling both varicella and zoster exist. In fact, herpes zoster is a disease arising from reactivation of the Varicella-Zoster-Virus (VZV), causing varicella in children. As reactivation occurs when cell-mediated immunity (CMI) declines, and there is evidence that re-exposure to VZV boosts CMI, mass varicella immunization might increase the zoster burden, at least for some decades. Fear of this natural zoster boom is the main reason for the paralysis of varicella immunization in Europe. We analyze the optimality system numerically focusing on the role of the cost functional, of the relative zoster-varicella cost, and of the planning horizon length. We show that optimal programs will mostly be unfeasible for public health due to their complex temporal profiles. This complexity is the consequence of the intrinsically antagonistic nature of varicella immunization programs when aimed to control both varicella and zoster. However we show that gradually increasing – thereby feasible - vaccination schedules, can perform largely better than routine programs with constant vaccine uptake. Finally we show the optimal profiles of feasible programs targeting mitigation of the post-immunization natural zoster boom with priority...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Sleep is {{regulated}} by two main processes. The circadian process provides a 24 -h rhythm and the homeostatic process reflects sleep pressure, which {{increases in the}} course of wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Both of these processes undergo major changes during development. For example, sleep homeostasis, measured by means of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA, EEG power between 0. 5 and 4. 5 [*]Hz), peaks around puberty and decreases during adolescence. In humans and rats these changes have been related to cortical maturation. We aimed to explore whether additional parameters as state dynamic (dynamic of sleep/wake behavior) parameters of movement velocity, trajectories and <b>micro-arousals</b> provide markers of rat maturation. The state dynamics reflect the stability of sleep within a specific sleep stage. We applied a state space technique (SST), a quantitative and unbiased method, based on frequency band ratios of the EEG to analyze the development of different sleep/wake states and state dynamics between vigilance states. EEG of recording electrodes at the frontal and parietal lobe were analyzed using conventional scoring criteria and SST. RESULTS We found that movement velocity, trajectories between sleep states and <b>micro-arousals</b> changed as an inverse U-shaped curve across maturation. At all ages, movement velocity over the frontal lobe is higher compared to the parietal lobe, while the number of trajectories and <b>micro-arousals</b> are reduced. Furthermore, we showed that SWA correlates negatively with movement velocity and the number of <b>micro-arousals.</b> The velocity in the parietal lobe correlates positively with the number of <b>micro-arousals.</b> As for SWA, trajectories seem primarily to depend on sleep homeostasis regulatory mechanisms while the movement velocity seems to be modulated by other sleep regulators like the circadian rhythms. CONCLUSIONS New insights in sleep/wake state dynamics are established with the SST, because trajectories, <b>micro-arousals</b> and velocities are not evident by traditional scoring methods. These dynamic measures may represent new indicators for changes in sleep regulatory processes across maturation...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Meng {{and his colleagues}} (Meng et al. 2016) found no {{relation}} between the existence of neuropathy in diabetic patients {{and the presence of}} sleep complaints. This different result may be explained by their dependence on a subjective sleep quality questionnaire (difficulty falling asleep, early final awakening, short or long sleep) without the use of objective PSG and MSLT. From this difference, we can conclude that many DPN patients may not be aware of their disordered sleep breathing which may only cause frequent <b>micro-arousals</b> not sufficient to awaken the patient. These <b>micro-arousals</b> may not affect the total sleep time but disturb the sleep quality with its diurnal consequences in the form of EDS, cognitive impairment, and mood changes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{cholinergic}} system {{is involved in}} arousal and in {{rapid eye movement sleep}} (REMS). To evaluate the contribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to these functions, we studied with polygraphic recordings the regulation of sleep in mice lacking the beta 2 subunit gene of the nAChRs, a major component of high-affinity nicotine binding sites in the brain. Nicotine (1 - 2 mg/kg, i. p.) increased wakefulness in wild-type but not knock-out animals, indicating that beta 2 -containing nAChRs mediate the arousing properties of nicotine. Under normal conditions, the beta 2 -/- mice displayed the same amounts of waking, non-REM sleep (NREMS) and REMS as their wild-type counterparts. However, they exhibited longer REMS episodes and a reduced fragmentation of NREMS by events characterized notably by a transient drop in EEG power and frequently associated with EMG activation, tentatively referred to as <b>micro-arousals.</b> Respiration monitoring showed that these events were accompanied with, but not caused by, breathing irregularities. Sleep deprivation of beta 2 -/- mice resulted in a normal increase in REMS episode duration and NREMS delta power but yielded a reduction of the number of <b>micro-arousals</b> in NREMS. In contrast, in beta 2 -/- mice, a 1 hr immobilization stress failed to produce the normal rebound in REMS in the following 12 hr and, instead, was associated with increased NREMS fragmentation and sustained corticosterone levels. Our results show that the beta 2 -containing nAChRs contribute to the organization of sleep by regulating the transient phasic activity in NREMS, the REMS onset and duration, and the REMS-promoting effect of stress...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of sleep-related breathing disorders {{is still in}} a period of rapid change. Considerable uncertainty exists in several major areas of patient assessment. Although early definitions of sleep apnoea enshrined the concept of rigid guidelines, such an approach is no longer helpful, and may constrain potential advances. The recognition of the basic pathophysiological events in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has evolved from purely apnoeas, to include hypopnoeas, and now to increased upper airway resistance alone. Our view as to the significant consequences of such respiratory events has also evolved from alterations to the classic sleep architecture, to hypoxic events, and now to <b>micro-arousals</b> and cardio-vascular events. The exact nature of a significant arousal is also far from clear, with the suggestion that perhaps even EEG based approaches to their measurement may not be telling us the whole story. Finally, the frequency of such respiratory events and their consequences, that lead to significant symptoms and long-term damage, is not known either. Thus, given this situation, the best we can achieve is broad guidelines that stress the main important physiological events and their consequences that need to be assessed, and then interpreted in conjunction with the patient's symptoms. This will not necessarily be the same for all patients and this report offers some general guidance, based on the experience of several centres throughout Europe...|$|R
40|$|An {{ascent to}} {{altitude}} {{has been shown}} to result in more central apneas and a shift towards lighter sleep in healthy individuals. This study employs spectral analysis to investigate the impact of respiratory disturbances (central/obstructive apnea and hypopnea or periodic breathing) at moderate altitude on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and to compare EEG changes resulting from respiratory disturbances and arousals. Data were collected from 51 healthy male subjects who spent 1  night at moderate altitude (2590  m). Power density spectra of Stage 2 sleep were calculated in a subset (20) of these participants with sufficient artefact-free data for (a) epochs with respiratory events without an accompanying arousal, (b) epochs containing an arousal and (c) epochs of undisturbed Stage 2 sleep containing neither arousal nor respiratory events. Both arousals and respiratory disturbances resulted in reduced power in the delta, theta and spindle frequency range and increased beta power compared to undisturbed sleep. The similarity of the EEG changes resulting from altitude-induced respiratory disturbances and arousals indicates that central apneas are associated with <b>micro-arousals,</b> not apparent by visual inspection of the EEG. Our findings may have implications for sleep in patients and mountain tourists with central apneas and suggest that respiratory disturbances not accompanied by an arousal may, none the less, impact sleep quality and impair recuperative processes associated with sleep more than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|High sleep quality {{promotes}} efficient {{performance in}} the following day. Sleep quality is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, light, sound and smell. Here, we investigated whether differences in the interface pressure distribution on healthy individuals during sleep influenced sleep quality. We defined four types of pressure models by differences in the area distribution and the subjective feelings that occurred when participants slept on the mattresses. One type of model was showed "over-concentrated" distribution of pressure; one was displayed "over-evenly" distributed interface pressure while the other two models were displayed intermediate distribution of pressure. A polysomnography analysis demonstrated an increase in duration and proportion of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep stages 3 and 4, as well as decreased number of <b>micro-arousals,</b> in subjects sleeping on models with pressure intermediately distributed compared to models with over-concentrated or over-even distribution of pressure. Similarly, higher scores of self-reported sleep quality were obtained in subjects sleeping on the two models with intermediate pressure distribution. Thus, pressure distribution, {{at least to some}} degree, influences sleep quality and self-reported feelings of sleep-related events, though the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The regulation of pressure models imposed by external sleep environment may be a new direction for improving sleep quality. Only an appropriate interface pressure distribution is beneficial for improving sleep quality, over-concentrated or -even distribution of pressure do not help for good sleep...|$|R
40|$|Two {{important}} aspects of a respiratory sleep study are a measure of inspiratory effort and {{an estimate of the}} number of arousals. These can be derived from an indirect estimate of beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP), pulse transit time (PTT). This study investigated the reproducibility of inspiratory BP falls (reflecting inspiratory effort), and BP arousals derived from PTT, and the contribution they could make to the management of the obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). Overnight PTT was recorded at home in 40 patients being investigated for OSAHS, and a second PTT recording was made in the sleep laboratory with full polysomnography. Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of their sleep disorder, and a third PTT recording was made at home in 13 patients subsequently established on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The reproducibility between the home and laboratory studies was reasonable (r= 0. 87 for inspiratory BP falls, r= 0. 81 for BP arousals). Both derivatives showed a clear progression through the three patient groups, which returned to normal on treatment. The differences between the groups were significant (p 4 % arterial oxygen saturation dip rate and electroencephalography <b>micro-arousals</b> at dividing patients into two groups, either requiring nasal CPAP or not requiring CPAP.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may improve arterial blood gases but may adversely affect sleep. We assessed sleep structure and blood gases before and during NIV in patients with restrictive disorders in hypercapnic ventilatory failure. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Sleep laboratory of Saint-Luc University Hospital (Belgium). Patients: Chart review of all patients with predominantly restrictive disorders and respiratory failure seen between 1987 and 2008 and evaluated with a baseline polysomnography (PSG) and a PSG under NIV. Measurements and results: Sixty patients aged (mean±SD) 48 ± 20 years, with total lung capacity of 57 ± 20 % of predicted value, PaO 2 of 62 ± 16 mm Hg and PaCO 2 54 ± 10 mm Hg, were included. At baseline, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, slow wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep were markedly decreased. Conversely, <b>micro-arousals</b> and stage I sleep (N 1) were increased. NIV administered with volume-cycled (53 %) or pressure-cycled (47 %) ventilators improved daytime PaO 2, PaCO 2, pH and HCO 3 -. In addition, sleep efficiency, REM sleep, mean and lowest nocturnal SpO 2 increased while stage 1, sleep fragmentation, and oxygen desaturation index decreased significantly.

40|$|Objectives: Spectral power {{contribution}} {{in the range}} of alpha activity is a well-known electrophysiological feature of human REM sleep, which could be caused by the spontaneous bursts of alpha activity not associated with arousals that usually appear during this brain state. The present study was undertaken to determine the density of alpha bursts during tonic and phasic (oculomotor) REM periods for each REM cycle. In addition, this phasic brain event was also described from a spectral and topographical point of view. Methods: Ten healthy right-handed subjects (5 females) aged 19 ± 25 years (mean 22. 9 years, SD 2. 6) participated in the present study. Each selected subject ®lled in a daily sleep log for 2 weeks before the experimental night to provide information on all 3 salient aspects of sleep pattern, sleep experience and sleep effects. Results: The results revealed that transient REM-alpha bursts, which lasted about 3 s and were accompanied by no increase in the EMG amplitude, appeared in all subjects who participated in this study, showing a higher density in the third and fourth REM cycle during phasic in comparison with tonic periods. The bandpass ®ltered signals showed the highest spectral contribution for the slower alpha components (8 ± 9 Hz), the occipital scalp regions being the main generator source of this brain activity. Conclusions: The authors hypothesize that REM-alpha bursts may work as <b>micro-arousals</b> (or incomplete arousals) facilitating the brain connection with the external world in this cerebral state, whereas REM-alpha arousals ± usually longer and accompanied by changes in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} the analysis of human sleep uses a set of pre-defined rules to allocate each 20 or 30 -s epoch to one of six main sleep stages. The application of these rules is performed either manually, by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram and related signals, or, more recently, by a software implementation of these rules on a computer. This article evaluates the limitations of rule-based sleep staging and then presents a new method of sleep analysis that makes no such use of pre-defined rules and stages, tracking instead the dynamic development of sleep on a continuous scale. The extraction of meaningful features from the electroencephalogram is first considered, and for this purpose a technique called autoregressive modelling was preferred to the more commonly-used methods of band-pass filtering or the fast Fourier transform. This is followed by a qualitative investigation into the dynamics of the electroencephalogram during sleep using a technique for data visualization known as a self-organizing feature map. The insights gained using this map led to the subsequent development of a new, quantitative method of sleep analysis that utilizes the pattern recognition capabilities of an artificial neural network. The outputs from this network provide a second-by-second quantification of the sleep/wakefulness continuum with a resolution that far exceeds that of rule-based sleep staging. This is demonstrated by the neural network's ability to pinpoint <b>micro-arousals</b> and highlight periods of severely disturbed sleep caused by certain sleep disorders. Both these phenomena are of considerable clinical value, but neither are scored satisfactorily using rule-based sleep staging...|$|R
40|$|Sleep is an {{important}} part of everyday life. It directly affects daytime cognition and general performance. In children, sleep is a crucial requirement for growth and learning and lack of sleep may manifest itself as a long lasting developmental deficit. Sleep disorders which disrupt the normal continuity of sleep therefore benefit from early identification and treatment. A common cause of sleep disruption is sleep disordered breathing which can be associated with frequent arousals from sleep. Many relevant areas of sleep research continue to generate new and interesting findings utilising biosignals such as EEGs. Respiratory cycle related EEG change (RCREC) is a good example of this. The method for quantification of RCREC relies on the appropriate application of signal processing and the signals involved in the procedure are polysomnographic. Furthermore, RCREC is thought to reflect morbid <b>micro-arousals</b> in sleep and is hence also of clinical importance. Given that the field of RCREC research is a recently established one, there is much room for constructive investigation. The current state of RCREC research is therefore expanded in this thesis. The method for calculation of respiratory cycle related EEG change (RCREC) is replicated and expanded in this project. Shortcomings of the method have been identified and accounted for where appropriate. In particular, the sensitivity of RCREC to airflow signal segmentation is addressed and alternative segmentation approaches are suggested. The general influence of airflow segmentation on RCREC is investigated and a mathematical explanation for RCREC sensitivity is given. Additionally, the ability of RCREC related parameters to predict daytime cognitive functions is assessed. Results suggest that RCREC parameters are capable of predicting quality of episodic memory, power (speed) of attention and internal processing speed...|$|R

More importantly, some automatic methods, which offer a less subjective approach, can provide additional information which {{it is not possible}} to obtain by manual analysis.;An extensive literature review has been undertaken to investigate the background of automatic EEG analysis techniques. Frequency domain and time domain methods are considered and their limitations are summarised. The weakness in the R & K rules for visual classification and from which most of the automatic systems borrow heavily are discussed.;A new technique - model based dynamic analysis - was developed in an attempt to classify the sleep EEG automatically. The technique comprises of two phases, these are the modelling of EEG signals and the analysis of the model's coefficients using dynamic systems theory. Three techniques of modelling EEG signals are compared: the implementation of the non-linear prediction technique of Schaffer and Tidd (1990) based on chaos theory; Kalman filters and a recursive version of a radial basis function for modelling and forecasting the EEG signals during sleep. The Kalman filter approach produced good results and this approach was used in an attempt to classify the EEG automatically. For classifying the model's (Kalman filter's) coefficients, a new technique was developed by a state-space approach. A 'state variable' was defined based on the state changes of the EEG and was shown to be correlated with the depth of sleep. Furthermore it is shown that this technique may be useful for automatic sleep staging. Possible applications include automatic staging of sleep, detection of <b>micro-arousals,</b> anaesthesia monitoring and monitoring the alertness of workers in sensitive or potentially dangerous environments...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionRespiratory events {{occurring}} under non-invasive ventilation (NIV) {{may produce}} sleep fragmentation. Alternatives to polysomnography (PSG) should be validated for providing simple monitoring tools for patients treated {{at home with}} NIV. ObjectivesTo study the value of pulse wave amplitude (PWA) reduction as {{a surrogate marker of}} cortical <b>micro-arousals</b> associated with respiratory events occurring during NIV. Methods 27 PSG tracings under NIV recorded in 9 stable patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS), under 3 different ventilator modes (no back-up rate, low or high back-up rate) were analyzed. For all respiratory events (obstructive, central, or mixed event), the association with EEG-micro-arousals, PWA reduction of more than 30 % and the presence of associated SpO 2 desaturation ≥ 4 % was recorded. Results 2474 respiratory events during NREM sleep were analyzed. 73. 6 % were associated with an EEG-MA, 91. 4 % with a ≥ 4 % decrease in SpO 2, and 74. 9 % with a significant PWA reduction. Sensitivity of PWA for the detection of an EEG-micro-arousal related to a respiratory event was 89. 1 % [95 %CI: 76. 7 – 95. 3]. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 87. 0 % [95 %CI: 75. 0 – 94. 0]. Sensitivity of PWA was highest in the S mode, compared to both other S/T modes, p = < 0. 001. Sensitivity of PWA was also higher for central and mixed events, compared to obstructive respiratory events, p = < 0. 05. ConclusionsPWA reduction is a sensitive marker with a high PPV for the detection of EEG-MA associated with respiratory events during NREM sleep in stable OHS patients treated by NIV. In this situation, PWA could be used to improve scoring of hypopneas and allow an appropriate assessment of sleep fragmentation related to respiratory events...|$|R
40|$|Conventional scoring {{of sleep}} {{provides}} little {{information about the}} process of transitioning between vigilance states. We applied the state space technique (SST) using frequency band ratios to follow normal maturation of different sleep/wake states, velocities of movements, and transitions between states of juvenile (postnatal day 34, P 34) and young adult rats (P 71). 24 -h sleep recordings of eight P 34 and nine P 71 were analyzed using conventional scoring criteria and SST one week following implantation of telemetric transmitter. SST is a non-categorical approach that allows novel quantitative and unbiased examination of vigilance-states dynamics and state transitions. In this approach, behavioral changes are described in a 2 -dimensional state space that is derived from spectral characteristics of the electroencephalography. With maturation sleep intensity declines, the duration of deep slow wave sleep (DSWS) and light slow wave sleep (LSWS) decreases and increases, respectively. Vigilance state determination, as a function of frequency, is not constant; there is a substantial shift to higher ratio 1 in all vigilance states except DSWS. Deep slow wave sleep decreases in adult relative to juvenile animals at all frequencies. P 71 animals have 400 % more trajectories from Wake to LSWS (p = 0. 005) and vice versa (p = 0. 005), and 100 % more <b>micro-arousals</b> (p = 0. 021), while trajectories from LSWS to DSWS (p = 0. 047) and vice versa (p = 0. 033) were reduced by 60 %. In both juvenile and adult animals, no significant changes were found in sleep velocity at all regions of the 2 -dimensional state space plot; suggesting that maturation has a partial effect on sleep stability. Here, we present novel and original evidence that SST enables visualization of vigilance-state intensity, transitions, and velocities that were not evident by traditional scoring methods. These observations provide new perspectives in sleep state dynamics and highlight the usefulness of this technique in exploring the development of sleep-wake activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In humans, rapid eye {{movements}} (REM) density during REM sleep plays {{a prominent}} role in psychiatric diseases. Especially in depression, an increased REM density is a vulnerability marker for depression. In clinical practice and research measurement of REM density is highly standardized. In basic animal research, almost no tools are available to obtain and systematically evaluate eye movement data, although, this would create increased comparability between human and animal sleep studies. Methods We obtained standardized electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and electrooculographic (EOG) signals from freely behaving mice. EOG electrodes were bilaterally and chronically implanted with placement of the electrodes directly between the musculus rectus superior and musculus rectus lateralis. After recovery, EEG, EMG and EOG signals were obtained for four days. Subsequent to the implantation process, we developed and validated an Eye Movement scoring in Mice Algorithm (EMMA) to detect REM as singularities of the EOG signal, based on wavelet methodology. Results The distribution of wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was typical of nocturnal rodents with small amounts of wakefulness and large amounts of NREM sleep during the light period and reversed proportions during the dark period. REM sleep was distributed correspondingly. REM density was significantly higher during REM sleep than NREM sleep. REM bursts were detected more often {{at the end of the}} dark period than the beginning of the light period. During REM sleep REM density showed an ultradian course, and during NREM sleep REM density peaked at the beginning of the dark period. Concerning individual eye movements, REM duration was longer and amplitude was lower during REM sleep than NREM sleep. The majority of single REM and REM bursts were associated with <b>micro-arousals</b> during NREM sleep, but not during REM sleep. Conclusions Sleep-stage specific distributions of REM in mice correspond to human REM density during sleep. REM density, now also assessable in animal models through our approach, is increased in humans after acute stress, during PTSD and in depression. This relationship can now be exploited to match animal models more closely to clinical situations, especially in animal models of depression. </p...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{pressure}} non-invasive ventilation (NIV) {{has been}} available {{for the treatment of}} chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure since the first publications by Sullivan et al, Delaubier, and Rideau in the early 1980 ’s. NIV was performed initially with volume-cycled ventilators, until the advent of bi-level pressure cycled ventilators, in the late 80 ’s, which were less cumbersome, cheaper, and in most cases perceived as more comfortable by users. The number of patients treated by NIV increased very regularly during the 1990 ’s, with a progressive shift in indications. As {{of the end of the}} 1990 ’s, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity-hypoventilation were clearly the most frequent indications for NIV. With the advent of bi-level pressure cycled ventilators, major changes occurred in ventilators, interfaces and monitoring techniques available. Adjustable inspiratory and expiratory triggers, adjustable rate of pressurization, built-in monitoring software and volume targeting are options currently available on many pressure cycled ventilators designed for home care. Initially, the aim of long term NIV was mainly to improve daytime arterial blood gases (mainly to correct PaCO 2) and to improve nocturnal oxygen saturation (SaO 2). The advent and validation of transcutaneous capnography showed however that monitoring of nocturnal PtcCO 2 was necessary to ensure an optimal control of nocturnal hypoventilation: indeed, re-setting of respiratory centres through correction of nocturnal PaCO 2 is probably the major physiologic explanation for the efficacy of home NIV. Also, although leaks through nasal interface were to some degree inevitable, it was shown that major leaks cause <b>micro-arousals</b> and disrupt patients’ sleep and conversely, that correction of mouth leaks was associated with improved sleep structure. More recently, an observational study in patients with obesity-hypoventilation treated by long term NIV showed that, in spite of satisfactory correction of nocturnal PtcCO 2 and SaO 2, major respiratory events could occur, often undetected by the patient, but leading to a decrease in sleep efficiency, an increase in <b>micro-arousals</b> and sleep disruption. Patient-ventilator asynchrony, auto-triggering, ventilator-induced periodic breathing, and of course, leaks were the major events identified. Actually, up to 55 % of chronic stable patients under NIV had significant periods of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and 40 % had periodic breathing. In a recent study, we showed that new options proposed on recent bi-level pressure cycled ventilators such as volume targeting could lead to detrimental changes in sleep structure, even if they did improve nocturnal PtcCO 2. The present study explores four different aspects of the patient-ventilator relationship during sleep and its monitoring. First, we evaluated the impact of NIV on sleep structure assessed by polysomnography (PSG) and arterial blood gases (ABG) in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: this aspect has received little attention in the medical literature. Surprisingly, very little recommendations detail how ventilators should be adjusted for long term home care. Therefore, we chose – in the second part of this study - to explore how the modification of one ventilator setting (back-up respiratory frequency) could affect quality of sleep and occurrence of respiratory events. In other words, we aimed to determine whether it is better, in terms of efficacy and patient-ventilator synchronisation, to use an “S” mode (spontaneous), an “ST” (Spontaneous/Timed mode) with an intermediate back-up rate, slightly below that of the patient, or a T mode, with a ventilator respiratory rate above that of the patient. This issue has to our knowledge only been marginally studied without any consensus. Thirdly, as previously mentioned, recent ventilators designed for home care have built-in softwares which provide potentially useful information for the clinician in terms of monitoring NIV at home. Clinicians need to know if values of tidal volume, leaks, or apnea-hypopnea index recorded by built-in software are reliable and can be used as recommended by AASM. These items however have not been independently validated, and we will show that there is large variability in the reliability of the results made available for the clinician. Finally, when exploring the many difficulties in analysing polygraphic and PSG data obtained in patients under NIV, we found that one major difficulty was to determine whether decreases in flow were associated with a decrease in ventilatory drive (i. e. central events) or not: a non-invasive monitoring of respiratory effort could be an attractive tool to evaluate the respiratory effort of the patient. We chose to determine whether Pulse Transit Time could be used as a surrogate marker of inspiratory effort under NIV. (MED 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Background Most {{patients}} with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) do not tolerate treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, the 'gold standard' treatment for this condition. It {{was shown in}} a pilot study that acupuncture was more effective than placebo treatment (sham acupuncture) in producing {{significant changes in the}} respiratory events assessed by polysomnography (PSG). Objectives To investigate the immediate effect of manual acupuncture (MA) and electroacupuncture (EA) on the sleep pattern of patients presenting with moderate OSA. Methods 40 {{patients with}} an Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) of 15 - 30 /h were randomly allocated to MA treatment (n= 10), EA 10 Hz treatment (n= 10), EA 2 Hz treatment (n= 10) and a no-treatment control group (n= 10). the patients received MA or EA (2 or 10 Hz) just before the PSG study at 20 : 00. Results the AHI (p= 0. 005; p= 0. 005), the Apnoea Index (p= 0. 038; p= 0. 009) and the respiratory events (p= 0. 039; p= 0. 014) decreased significantly in the MA and EA 10 Hz groups, respectively (AHI (21. 9, 11. 2), Apnoea Index (5. 15, 0. 7), respiratory events (120. 5, 61. 0) in the MA group before and after. AHI (20. 6, 9. 9), Apnoea Index (8. 2, 0. 3), respiratory events (117. 0, 56. 0) in the EA 10 Hz group before and after). the <b>micro-arousals</b> decreased only in the MA group (146. 0 vs 88. 5, p= 0. 0002). There were no significant changes in the EA 2 Hz group or in the control group. Conclusion A single session of either MA or EA 10 Hz had an acute effect in reducing the AHI as well as the number of nocturnal respiratory events of patients presenting with moderate OSA.
