2500|$|On January 20, 1913 a <b>marine</b> <b>court</b> {{of inquiry}} was {{conducted}} to {{determine the cause of}} the disaster. [...] The court criticized the construction work on the cabins and other work that had been done to the vessel since for making the ship top heavy. [...] The court also found that it had been the practice to leave freight doors open for ventilation, and it was possible these were open or not properly secured {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 February 1901, she {{sustained}} damage and began taking on water after striking ground twice during passage between North Evans Reef and Evans Head, then, upon arrival at Ballina, she was grounded on the bar. [...] A <b>Marine</b> <b>Court</b> held {{an inquiry into}} the incident, concluding that master William Slater was free from blame for either mishap, the first being due to an uncharted rock and the second wrong official information about the depth of water over the bar. [...] Having been on suspension, Slater was reinstated after the finding. Second mate James Langlands was also brought before the same inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 August 1901, {{just three}} days after the court's hearing on the Hixson collision, the Oakland ran aground {{on the north side of}} the {{southern}} breakwater at the mouth of the Richmond River, causing extensive damage and was considered a total wreck. [...] She was then under the ownership of the North Coast Steamship Navigation Company and command of Capt. Daniel Molloy. [...] Although attempting entry some minutes after the flood tide signal had been lowered, the master was found blameless for running aground in insufficient draft by a <b>Marine</b> <b>Court</b> of Inquiry. [...] Five days after this finding, reports of her refloat on 1 October 1901 were met with surprise by the shipping industry generally. [...] After an extensive overhaul in Sydney, she returned to service on 16 February 1902, plying her old route to Richmond Heads. [...] She was placed under the command of Capt. Beech.|$|E
60|$|Since {{steering}} for the land, our prospects {{had been}} much talked over. By many it was supposed that, should the captain leave the ship, the crew were no longer bound by her articles. This was the opinion of our forecastle Cokes; though, probably, {{it would not have}} been sanctioned by the <b>Marine</b> <b>Courts</b> of Law. At any rate, such was the state of both vessel and crew that, whatever might be the event, a long stay, and many holidays in Tahiti, were confidently predicted.|$|R
60|$|All {{hands of}} us were {{glad to be back}} in the Crisis again. Captain Williams had {{remained}} at Falmouth longer than he expected, to make some repairs that could not be thoroughly completed at sea, which alone prevented him from getting into the river as soon as I did myself. Now the ship was in, we no longer felt any apprehension of being impressed, Sweeney's malignancy having set several of the gang upon the scent after us. Whether the fellow actually thought I was an English subject or not, is more than I ever knew; but I felt no disposition myself to let the point be called in question, before my Lord Chief Justice of a Rendezvous. The King's Bench was more governed by safe principles, in its decisions, than the gentlemen who presided in these <b>marine</b> <b>courts</b> of the British navy.|$|R

50|$|According {{to several}} {{witnesses}} and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, the US Marines' {{response to the}} car bombing included indiscriminate firing at passing civilians on the busy highway. They asserted that elderly men, {{women and children were}} killed.

These assertions would be disputed during the subsequent US <b>Marine</b> Corps <b>court</b> of inquiry.|$|R
5000|$|Financing and {{construction}} presented challenges as Marineland {{was the first}} attempt at capturing and sustaining sea creatures. These challenges were overcome. Construction and engineering were carried out Arthur Franklin Perry Co. of Jacksonville. On June 23, 1938, [...] "Marine Studios" [...] (the name [...] "Marineland of Florida" [...] would later be adopted) began operations with its main attraction a bottlenose dolphin. Unexpectedly, over 20,000 tourists clogged Highway A1A to visit the new attraction. For many decades Marineland consisted of not only the oceanariums but several amenities including a motel (<b>Marine</b> Village <b>Court,</b> Marineland Motel and Quality Inn/Marineland); Dolphin Restaurant and Moby Dick Lounge; Periwinkle Snack Bar and Sandpiper Snack Bar; Marineland Marina; plus fruit shop and gift shop; and a pier {{at the north end}} of the facility. A Texaco service station was adjacent to the Periwinkle Snack Bar, and Greyhound Bus Lines stopped regularly during its St. Augustine to Daytona Beach run.|$|R

60|$|The New Englanders {{were the}} first to take the field against the project of taxation.

They sent petitions and remonstrances on the subject to the king, the lords and the commons, in which they were seconded by New York and Virginia. All was in vain. In March, 1765, the act was passed, according to which all instruments in writing were to be executed on stamped paper, to be purchased from the agents of the British government. What was more, all offences against the act could be tried in any royal, <b>marine</b> or admiralty <b>court</b> throughout the colonies, however distant from the place where the offence had been committed; thus interfering with that most inestimable right, a trial by jury.|$|R
40|$|The {{headline}} {{holding of}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Atlantic Marine is its conclusion that a forum-selection clause is usually enforceable {{under the federal}} transfer statute, 28 U. S. C. § I 404 (a). Also lurking within the opinion, however, is a significant shift in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach to choice of law in federal <b>courts.</b> In Atlantic <b>Marine,</b> the <b>Court</b> held that after a transfer to enforce a forum-selection clause, the transferee district court must apply the choice-of-law rules {{of the state in}} which it sits. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale is straightforward-the plaintiff {{should not be allowed to}} flout the forum-selection clause and obtain the benefits of more favorable choice-of-law rules of another state. But the Court 2 ̆ 7 s new rule is a departure from its prior treatment of choice of law in transfer cases, which provided that after a § I 404 (a) transfer the transferee court must apply the choiceof- law rules of the transferor court, which, in diversity cases, means the choice-of-law rules of the state in which the transferor court sits. This rule was based on several longstanding principles of what I call choice-of-law federalism, which itself is premised on respect for the substantive policies underlying states 2 ̆ 7 choice-of-law rules and the refusal to sanction different applicable law in federal and state courts within the same state-even in the face of evident interstate forum shopping by plaintiffs. This Article examines how the Court 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment of these principles creates numerous complications in its jurisprudence under the Erie doctrine and in choice of law...|$|R

They sent petitions and remonstrances on the subject to the king, the lords and the commons, in which they were seconded by New York and Virginia. Franklin appeared in London at the head of agents from Pennsylvania, Connecticut and South Carolina, to deprecate, in person, measures so fraught with mischief. The most eloquent arguments were used by British orators and statesmen to dissuade Grenville from enforcing them. He was warned of the sturdy independence of the colonists, and the spirit of resistance he might provoke. All was in vain. Grenville, [...] "great in daring and little in views," [...] says Horace Walpole, [...] "was charmed to have an untrodden field before him of calculation and experiment." [...] In March, 1765, the act was passed, according to which all instruments in writing were to be executed on stamped paper, to be purchased from the agents of the British government.
