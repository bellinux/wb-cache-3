Thus, this research aims to understand on how the Malaysian award winners for exemplary mothers category (Ibu Mithālī) show their love and <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> their <b>children</b> in order <b>to</b> develop parent-child attachment. To answer the research question, research was done using Grounded Theory approach. As a result, three main themes have emerged: physical touch, emotional touch and spiritual touch. Love and mercy from mothers are pertinent in child development. Therefore, mothers should nurture their children with love {{and compassion}} to balance firm discipline and strict rules in the family...|$|R
60|$|About {{this time}} the cloud which hung over the {{emigrant}} ship was darkened still more by {{a visit from the}} Angel of Death. The mother of Brown-eyes died. At that time Pauline was indeed an angel of <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> mother and <b>child.</b> After the remains of the mother were committed to the deep, the poor orphan clung so piteously to Pauline that it was scarcely possible to tear her away. It was agreed at last that, as the child had now no natural protector, except an uncle and aunt, who seemed to think they had already too many children of their own, Pauline should adopt her.|$|R

[...] "He did well, that poor father! He placed his life in the hands of his Maker, asking only for <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> his innocent <b>children.</b> And mercy has been shown to him and to them. He was taken gently in the way he wished. It would have broken my heart for those two poor girls if the verdict had gone otherwise.

50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of the Free Church of Scotland, and raised over £116,000 for the Manse Fund for its ministers. Guthrie {{expressed}} serious concern that the Manse Fund would stretch the generosity of Free Church people to the limit but he needn't have worried. After Guthrie had toured 13 Synods and 58 Presbyteries in less than a year, he was able to announce to the General Assembly of June 1846 that £116,370 had been raised. It is unlikely that anyone else could have achieved what he did in such a short space of time. His energy and oratory enabled the Manse Fund to smash its original target. Numerous ministers and their families owed a huge debt of gratitude to Guthrie for providing the resources to build manses so that the gospel could continue to prosper not just in the Highlands but across the whole of Scotland. Along with his Ragged Schools the Manse Fund was one of Guthrie's greatest legacies. With the one he showed <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> helpless <b>children</b> and with the other he fought oppression by raising funds for manses.|$|R
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{arrival of}} republican {{soldiers in the}} neighbourhood of Durbellière was neither expected, or even feared by {{the inhabitants of the}} château, or {{it would not have been}} left by Henri, as it had been, perfectly undefended. The truth was this: the royalists had hitherto been so very generally successful against the republicans; and that, when every odds of number, arms, and position had been in favour of their enemies, that they had learnt to look with contempt upon the blues, as they called them. Hitherto the royalists had always been the attacking party; the republicans had contented themselves with endeavouring to keep their position within the towns; and when driven from thence, had retreated altogether out of the revolted district. Except lately at Nantes, the Vendeans had as yet incurred no great reverse; they had not, therefore, learnt to fear that their houses would be attacked and burnt; their corn and cattle destroyed; and even their wives and children massacred. The troops which had now been dispatched by the Convention for the subjection of the country, were of a very different character from those with whom the Vendeans had as yet contended, and the royalists were not long before they experienced all the horrors of a civil war, in which quarter was refused them by their enemies, and <b>mercy</b> even <b>to</b> <b>children</b> was considered as a crime.|$|R

50|$|The Chaplet of Divine Mercy was {{introduced}} in the early 1930s by Saint Faustina Kowalska, a nun who lived in Płock, Poland.

[...] As in the prayers that form the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, there are three main themes <b>to</b> the Divine <b>Mercy</b> devotion: <b>to</b> ask for and obtain the <b>mercy</b> of God, <b>to</b> trust in Christ's abundant <b>mercy,</b> and finally <b>to</b> show <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> others and act as a conduit for God's mercy towards them.|$|R

What if a man {{has never}} so much gold or silver, or food, or raiment: yet if he has none to communicate, what is the distressed, or those in want, the better? What if there be mercy with God, yet if he has none to bestow, what force is there in the exhortation, or what shall Israel, if he hopeth, be the better. But God has <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> bestow, to give. 'He saith on this wise, I {{will give you the}} sure mercies of David' (Acts 13:34). And again, 'The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus' (2 Tim 1:16). Now then, here lies the encouragement. The Lord has <b>mercy</b> <b>to</b> give; he has not given away ALL his mercy; his mercy is not clean gone for ever (Psa 77:8). He has <b>mercy</b> yet <b>to</b> give away, yet to bestow upon his Israel. 'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy.' ...|$|R
