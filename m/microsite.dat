The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon.

40|$|Semi-arid and arid {{ecosystems}} {{dominated by}} shrubs (“dry shrublands”) {{are an important}} component of the global C cycle, but impacts of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO 2 on biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems have not been synthetically assessed. This study synthesizes data from manipulative studies and from studies contrasting ecosystem processes in different vegetation <b>microsites</b> (that is, shrub or herbaceous canopy versus intercanopy <b>microsites),</b> to assess how changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 affect biogeochemical cycles by altering plant and microbial physiology and ecosystem structure. Further, we explore how ecosystem structure impacts on biogeochemical cycles differ across a climate gradient. We found that: (1) our ability to project ecological responses to changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 is limited by a dearth of manipulative studies, and by a lack of measurements in those studies that can explain biogeochemical changes, (2) changes in ecosystem structure will impact biogeochemical cycling, with decreasing pools and fluxes of C and N if vegetation canopy <b>microsites</b> were to decline, and (3) differences in biogeochemical cycling between <b>microsites</b> are predictable with a simple aridity index (MAP/MAT), where the relative difference in pools and fluxes of C and N between vegetation canopy and intercanopy <b>microsites</b> is positively correlated with aridity. We conclude that if climate change alters ecosystem structure, it will strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, with increasing aridity leading to greater heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling among <b>microsites.</b> Additional long-term manipulative experiments situated across dry shrublands are required to better predict climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycling in deserts...|$|R

The results for Zygia cataractae were inconclusive but suggested N- 2 fixation in drier <b>microsites.</b> Nodulated Inga disticha had a N- 15 -to-N- 14 ratio similar to non-N- 2 -fixing trees, but ARA indicated nitrogenase activity and leghaemoglobin was present in nodules.

About 35 - 50 % of N in the leaves of P. officinalis, H. corymbosa and I. pilosula was fixed from the atmosphere.

The impact of earthworm macrofauna on Atrazine mineralization was assessed in representative soil <b>microsites</b> of earthworm activities (gut contents, casts, burrow linings). Soil with or without earthworms, namely the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris and the endogenic species Aporrectodea caliginosa, was either inoculated or not inoculated with Pseudomonas sp.

The structure of the bacterial community, the Atrazine-degrading activity and the abundance of atzA, B and C sequences in soil <b>microsites</b> were investigated. Atrazine mineralization was found to be reduced in representative soil <b>microsites</b> of earthworm activities. Earthworms significantly affected the structure of soil bacterial communities.
