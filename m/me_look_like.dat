2500|$|Able {{to travel}} {{the world as a}} member of the Bolshoi, Plisetskaya changed the world of ballet by her skills and technique, setting a higher {{standard}} for ballerinas both in terms of technical brilliance and dramatic presence. Having allowed her to tour in New York, Khrushchev was immensely satisfied upon reading the reviews of her performances. “He embraced her upon her return: ‘Good girl, coming back. Not making <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a fool. You didn’t let me down.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen {{friendship}} as {{the reason}} for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. [...] "It makes them easier. Jake is a good friend. I know he's got my back and {{is not going to make}} <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an ass onscreen. I hope I return the favor," [...] said Hansis. [...] "I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable." [...] Silbermann added, [...] "I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, I think it makes it more comfortable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a clown. I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The room then {{fills with}} supplicants to the Princess ("Drei arme adelige Waisen"). An Italian tenor {{sent by the}} Portuguese {{ambassador}} serenades the Marschallin ("Di rigori armato"), while Ochs works out the marriage contract with the Marschallin's notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, try to sell the Princess the latest scandal sheets, but she coldly declines. Rudely interrupting the tenor's song, Ochs tells the notary to demand a dower from Sophie's family (having confused dower with dowry). The notary attempts to explain that such is impossible under the law. Valzacchi and Annina now offer their services to Ochs. He asks whether they {{know anything about the}} Princess's [...] "maid". They don't, but they assure him that they do. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: [...] "My dear Hippolyte, today you have made <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an old woman." [...] ("Mein lieber Hippolyte").|$|E
2500|$|Gauci and Matt Corby {{were the}} two contestants on the show's grand finale. At the {{conclusion}} of each series, a [...] "Winner's Single" [...] is released. The 2007 winner's single, [...] "Here I Am", was written by Lindy Robbins and Tom Leonard, who had previously written for the Backstreet Boys. Both Corby and Gauci were critical of the track, with Gauci professing confusion as the demo version had male vocals – she adapted it {{to be consistent with}} her jazz music style. While Corby felt it was [...] "not something I'd choose to release ... Yes, I'm being diplomatic. Even though this competition has made <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> I'm into pop, I'm really not". On 25 November 2007, Gauci was declared the winner of Australian Idol 2007. She became the first contestant to progress to the top12 through a judges' lifeline and then win the competition.|$|E

2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

60|$|As I {{said this}} I saw his eyes {{beginning}} to wander {{away from my}} face--to wander slowly, inch by inch, as it were, until they stopped at a certain point, with the same fixed stare into vacancy which had so often startled me on former occasions.

5000|$|The Sumerian tablets never {{actually}} describe what {{any of the}} <b>mes</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> but they are clearly represented by physical objects of some sort.
