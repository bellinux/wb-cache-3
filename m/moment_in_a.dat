5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E

Subsequently, Kinski started leaving the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself.

25|$|In 1984, {{more than}} 24 {{million people in}} Great Britain watched ice dancing pair Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean earn {{unanimous}} 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> UK poll. In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the Associated Press as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, ladies' figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind NFL football out of over 100 sports surveyed. The 1993 study found that three figure skaters — Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, and Scott Hamilton — were among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, out of over 800 athletes surveyed. Dorothy Hamill was statistically tied with Mary Lou Retton as the most popular athlete in America. The Tonya Harding scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating. The {{first night of the}} ladies' figure skating competition in the 1994 Winter Olympics achieved higher TV Nielsen ratings than that year's Super Bowl and was the most watched sports television program of all-time, to that date.|$|E
25|$|Hawkeye enjoys many adventures {{with the}} Avengers and proves himself a hero on {{numerous}} occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battle, Clint decides {{to adopt a}} new costume and identity by succeeding Hank Pym as the new Goliath. Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother Barney, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States {{and came to the}} Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.) Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the Kree-Skrull War Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the Vision over the affections of the Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.|$|E

500|$|While deconstructionists have {{concluded}} that we must abandon any further attempts to create a comprehensive vision of the world, Cobb and other constructive postmodernists believe that metaphysics and comprehensive world-models are possible and still needed. [...] In particular, they have argued for a new Whiteheadian metaphysics based on events rather than substances. [...] In this formulation, it is incorrect {{to say that a}} person or thing ("substance") has a fundamental identity that remains constant, and that any changes to the person or thing are secondary to what it is. [...] Instead, each <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> person's life ("event") is seen as a new actuality, thus asserting that continual change and transformation are fundamental, while static identities are far less important.

500|$|Egdon Heath (1927) was Holst's {{first major}} orchestral work after The Planets. Matthews summarises the music as [...] "elusive and {{unpredictable}} [...] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody , a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe." [...] The mysterious dance {{towards the end}} is, says Matthews, [...] "the strangest <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strange work". Richard Greene in Music & Letters describes the piece as [...] "a larghetto dance in a siciliano rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody", but lacking the power of The Planets and, at times, monotonous to the listener. A more popular success was the Moorside Suite for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, [...] "from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of Saturn".|$|E

Ben Ratliff of The New York Times criticized the performance, writing that it was [...] "the evening's most comical <b>moment,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concert involving a bustier made with motorcycle lights". Speaking of her London O2 Arena performance on November 15, 2009, Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail wrote, [...] "Her incredible vocal abilities were showcased during ballads such as 'Broken Hearted Girl' ... where she was note perfect throughout." [...] Michael Cragg of musicOMH highlighted that Beyoncé's performance of [...] "Broken-Heated Girl" [...] was better {{than those of the}} previous two ballads [...] "because it is allowed to exist on its own terms; a simple song, sung beautifully".

500|$|EarthBound {{was listed}} in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, where Christian Donlan {{wrote that the}} game is [...] "name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it's {{actually}} been played". Similarly, Eurogamer Simon Parkin {{described it as a}} [...] "sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti". Donlan called the game [...] "utterly brilliant" [...] and praised its overworld and battle system. Kotaku described aspects of the game's story, such as the [...] "Mr. Saturn coffee break", as [...] "poignant". Jeremy Parish of USgamer called EarthBound [...] "the all-time champion" [...] of self-aware games that [...] "warp ... perceptions and boundaries" [...] and break the fourth wall, citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game. He thought the final scene was [...] "perhaps the most clever and powerful <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clever and powerful game". David Sanchez of GameZone wrote that EarthBound [...] "went places no other game would" [...] in the 1990s or even in the present day, including [...] "trolling" [...] the player [...] "before trolling was cool". Author Hiromi Kawakami told Itoi that she had played the game [...] "about 80 times". GamesTM said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on [...] "personal experiences" [...] made it [...] "exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit". He called this accomplishment [...] "remarkable" [...] and credited Nintendo's commitment to the [...] "voices of creators". IGN's Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final boss fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] and noted its emotional impact. Kotaku wrote that the game was content to make the player [...] "feel lonely", and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.|$|E

[...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E
