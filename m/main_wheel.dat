5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E

25|$|The C.180 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} undercarriage. Each <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> was {{mounted on a}} {{half-axle}} hinged from the lower fuselage and located by a hinged trailing strut, with a vertical, shock absorbing leg to the outer wing centre section below the engine, providing a wide track.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, the single Gruppe of the Luftwaffe that was {{dedicated}} to ground support was II.(Schl)/LG 2, operating 22 Hs 123s (along with 38 Bf 109Es). In service use on the Eastern Front, the remaining aircraft had been field-modified with the <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> spats removed, additional armour and extra equipment fitted as well as mounting extra machine guns and even cannons in under-wing housings.|$|E
25|$|Gear inches {{corresponds}} to the diameter (in inches) of the <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> of an old-fashioned penny-farthing bicycle with equivalent gearing. Metres of development {{corresponds to}} the distance (in metres) traveled by the bicycle for one rotation of the pedals. Gain ratio is the ratio between the distance travelled by the bicycle and the distance travelled by a pedal, and is a pure number, independent of any units of measurement.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of the Japanese Ministry of Railways for a survey aircraft, Mitsubishi developed a civilian version of the Type 92, the Hato survey aircraft. A single aircraft was ordered in 1935, together with a Fokker Super Universal built by Nakajima. Powered by a 298kW (400hp) Mitsubishi A5 engine, it differed from the military version in having a glazed canopy over the rear cockpit (which accommodated a crew of two), an open forward pilot's cockpit, and spat-type <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> fairings. It was delivered in March 1936 and registered J-AARA.|$|E
50|$|Off-road {{vehicles}} such as agricultural tractors generally use positive camber. In such vehicles, {{the positive}} camber angle helps {{to achieve a}} lower steering effort. Also, some single-engined general aviation aircraft that are primarily meant to operate from unimproved surfaces, such as bush planes and cropdusters, have their taildragger gear's <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> equipped with positive-cambered <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> to better handle the deflection of the landing gear, as the aircraft settles on rough, unpaved airstrips.|$|R

25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E
500|$|Bungee {{launching}} {{was widely}} used {{in the early days}} of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or [...] "bungee". For this launch method, the glider's <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.|$|E
500|$|Salisbury cathedral clock, {{dating from}} about 1386, {{is one of}} the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest. [...] It still has most of its {{original}} parts, although its original verge and foliot timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a pendulum, which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956. [...] It has no dial, as its purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. The wheels and gears are mounted in an open, box-like iron frame, measuring about [...] square. The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs. [...] Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the <b>main</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is regulated by the escapement, and the other drives the striking mechanism and the air brake.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{landing gear}} was {{strengthened}} {{and the size of}} the <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> was increased to 650 x 200 mm (25.5 x 7.87 in).|$|R
500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed. The four <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to [...] The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of [...] The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate.|$|E

2500|$|A small {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} Hs 123A-0s {{was completed in}} 1936 for service evaluation by the Luftwaffe. This initial group {{was followed by the}} slightly modified Hs 123A-1 series, the first production examples. The service aircraft flew with an armoured headrest and fairing in place (a canopy was tested in the Hs 123V6) as well as removable <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> spats and a faired tailwheel. The main weapon load of four SC50 50kg (110lb) bombs could be carried in lower wing racks along with an additional SC250 250kg (550lb) bomb mounted on a [...] "crutch" [...] beneath the fuselage. The usual configuration was to install an auxiliary fuel [...] "drop" [...] tank at this station that was jettisoned in emergencies.

[...] remained at between 70% and 80% N1 throughout until the crew shut down both engines after stopping the aircraft. Five of the aircraft's eight <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> tires deflated and airport fire fighters reported that smoke and flames were coming from the landing gear.
