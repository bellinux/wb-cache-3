500|$|In 1904, Lady Munster {{produced}} an autobiography entitled <b>My</b> <b>Memories</b> and Miscellanies. In its foreword, {{she explained that}} [...] "some valued friends" [...] convinced her to write it, despite her reluctance, because her [...] "long life" [...] had witnessed [...] "not a few interesting events". The book was called her [...] "chief work" [...] in The Manchester Guardian {{at the time of}} her death in 1906. The Countess wrote the entire book by memory, and expressed regret that she had given up her journal writing as a young girl after someone else improperly read it. The autobiography included several recounted sightings of the female ghost [...] "Green Jean" [...] at Wemyss Castle; Lady Munster claimed that several members of her family, including Millicent, saw the ghost while staying there.|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from <b>my</b> <b>memories,</b> when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era I want to look at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some. Then I played Tommy a couple that I'd written, and he said, 'Whoa, that's a great idea,' so we selected a couple of those. [...] We all made suggestions, and we took all those suggestions to the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Champion" [...] is a {{relatively}} slow-paced, retrospective downtempo ballad that draws heavily from hardcore hip hop. It is also influenced by other genres, such as R, new-age, and space music. The [...] "anthemic" [...] and [...] "inspiring" [...] song features a low-key, woozy, and snaky production, accompanied by prominent military-style drums, heavy synths, and rough, hard strewn beats. [...] "Champion" [...] {{has been described as}} one of the few songs that Minaj's delivery is [...] "calm and collected" [...] as opposed to her eccentric [...] "Roman" [...] tracks. The rise to fame, the trials and tribulations that ensue, and celebration are prominent themes that are discussed in the lyrics. Minaj also makes reference to her deceased cousin, Nicholas Telemaque, who was shot and killed near his Brooklyn home on July 3, 2011, in the line [...] "'Cause they killed my little cousin, Nicholas/ But <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> only have happy images." [...] Multiple critics felt the lyrical content of [...] "Champion" [...] was the most sincere on the album. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called them [...] "genuinely heartbreaking", and Alex Macpherson of Fact described them as [...] "undeniably moving".|$|E

500|$|Upon retirement, Whiteside {{studied to}} become a podiatrist, graduating with a degree from the University of Salford, and served Northwich Victoria as their {{assistant}} manager/physio from October 1991 until March 1992. He quit the role as he did not enjoy {{the amount of time}} spent travelling between games. During his playing career, he had attended courses at Lilleshall to pick up his coaching badges, but he did not wish to go into coaching. He instead became an after-dinner speaker. He also worked for the Professional Footballers' Association, while taking a postgraduate course at Manchester Metropolitan University. He later took up private practice as a podiatrist in Manchester. Since 1994, he has also worked at the corporate hospitality department at Old Trafford. In 2003, he released a book entitled <b>My</b> <b>Memories</b> of Manchester United. With the help of writer Rob Bagchi, he released his autobiography entitled Determined in August 2007, published by Headline, and with a foreword by actor James Nesbitt. When Saturday Comes magazine reviewer Joyce Woolridge wrote that [...] "Determined is an entertaining, well written account of one of the less ordinary 1980s footballers, with the added twist of how Whiteside was able to rebuild his life, if not his knee." [...] The next month it was reported that Whiteside had been diagnosed with irregular heart rhythms. Whiteside worked as a pundit on ITV's coverage of UEFA Euro 2016.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was born}} on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both {{physicians}} in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi from Ambala. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, {{a former member of}} Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra and Mannara Chopra are her cousins. Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, [...] "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> of that place are tremendous... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race {{up to the top of}} the stupa". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.|$|E

She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human and someday <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> will grow dimmer. I don't want to lose <b>my</b> <b>memories</b> of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living told me that it helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully. Even when her time was limited, she didn't give up hope and lived diligently, and I wanted to let people know of Jin-young's passionate life." ...|$|E
