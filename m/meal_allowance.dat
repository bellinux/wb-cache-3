25|$|Kowalski, a state trooper, {{reported}} {{wages for}} 1970 that included {{only a portion}} of his meal allowances (he included $326.45, which omitted $1,371.09 in allowances). The Commissioner believed that this amount should have been included in income, and determined a tax deficiency. Kowalski argued that the cash <b>meal</b> <b>allowance</b> was not compensatory, but was furnished for the convenience of the employer and therefore wasn’t income under I.R.C. §61(a), and that alternatively, it was excluded under I.R.C. §119.|$|E
25|$|The State of New Jersey {{instituted a}} cash <b>meal</b> <b>allowance</b> for its state police {{officers}} in July 1949. Before that, troopers were provided a mid-shift meal at one of several meal stations located throughout the State. The State had decided that this system was unsatisfactory, as it required troopers to leave their patrol areas unattended for extended periods of time. The new system provided troopers with a cash allowance, which troopers could use to purchase a meal at a location within their patrol area, thus making it unnecessary for them to leave the area unmonitored.|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts of meal voucher sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features of the Czech meal voucher scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison of the Czech meal voucher system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> on various income deciles, quantify the impact of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment of current <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> by flat <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent households receive <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement of current <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> scheme by one with a flat <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|R

The {{population of the}} study was 100 workers from sections and units of this organization. The study used descriptive statistics (frequencies, and percentages) to answer three research questions posed for the study the result obtained from the analysis showed that there existed relationship between employee motivation and the organizational performance. The study reveals that extrinsic and instinct motivation given to workers in an organization has a significant influence on the workers performance. This is in line with equity theory which emphasizes that fairness in the remuneration package tends to produce higher performance from workers. It is recommended that all firms should adopt extrinsic and intrinsic incentive in their various firms to increase employee performance. On the bases of these findings, employers are continually challenged to develop good motivation polices on pay policies, etc good working condition, promotion, training, rewards, <b>meals</b> <b>allowances,</b> and procedures that will enable them to attract, motivate, retain and satisfy their employees.

30|$|Our employee-level data provide {{not only}} total yearly wage {{but also its}} {{different}} wage components: basic wage, bonus, supplements, and overtime pay. Bonuses can differ between individuals and {{are based on the}} productivity of workers. Supplements are given to all workers with certain job characteristic, such as those who work night hours or who have more years of tenure in the firm. Information on pay is the yearly total. We divide this yearly total by 12 to construct a monthly pay variable. In comparing wages to the legal minimum wage it is important to use the correct measure of wages. Legally, the wage compared to the minimum wage should include the basic wage plus bonus plus some, but not all, supplements. Overtime pay, the employer contribution to social insurance, and some legally-mandated supplements should be excluded. Other wage supplements that should be excluded when comparing wages to the minimum wage include those for working the night shift and working under dangerous or uncomfortable working conditions. Wage supplements that should be included when comparing wages to the minimum wage are those that are not legally mandated, and include those for medical and health benefits, for tenure, <b>meal</b> <b>allowances,</b> transportation supplements, supplements for books and newspapers, and cost of living adjustments. However, our data only report total supplements paid to workers. That is, we cannot distinguish between supplements that are legally required {{to be included in the}} minimum wage and those legally excluded. Because we cannot distinguish which part of reported supplements should or should not be included when comparing to the minimum wage, when we calculate the proportion of full-time workers earning less than the monthly minimum wage, we present two estimates: the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus (an upper bound) and the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus plus supplements (a lower bound).|$|R

40|$|Tax {{optimization}} {{is a legal}} {{technique to}} decrease tax liability without breaking the law. The Czech legislation enables several ways to legally reduce revenues and therefore the individual as well as corporate income tax. For that reason, taking advantage of this option is a logical conduct of every taxable unit. This B. A. thesis aims to analyze the tax burden of a five-employee company and propose the best solution of tax minimization of the particular company. Eight possibilities of tax optimization are mentioned in this thesis, namely superannuation scheme allowence, personal life insurance <b>allowance,</b> food <b>allowance</b> (<b>meal</b> tickets), long-term property renewal provision, utilising the tax allowance in connection with reduced working capacity employees, acquiring immaterial tangible assets, acquiring long-term tangible assets and tax relief when providing donations. The aforementioned options indicate the best ways of minimizing the tax burden. However, not every company in the Czech Republic {{can take advantage of}} all the options, since individual entrepreneurial subjects are specific in their own way, making the particular company choose the most appropriate way of tax optimization...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analysed}} the nature, causes, aftermath, {{and management}} of students’ unrest in a higher learning institution. This descriptive case study survey was guided by the theories of campus ecology, cognitive dissonance, and relative deprivation to identify {{the root causes of}} students’ unrest. The research focused on the academic, managerial and allocative, political, religious and welfare issues as areas of the root causes of students’ unrest in the higher learning institution. In most cases,the university administration used authoritarian methods. Alternative approaches which involved problem solving, negotiation and arbitration were emphasised. It was argued that students’ unrestled to destruction of property, stoppage of academic programmes, and loss of peaceful learning environment, and lowers the credibility of the institution. The major technique of data collection were documentary review and interviews of the key informants of the selected unrests. The research has employed Mkumbo’s (2002) steps of analysing students’ crises. These steps were:defining the students’ unrest, events leading to the unrest, characterisation of the unrest, needs that required attention and mechanism used to solve the unrest. The study recommends the involment of workers and students in decision making, to improve communication system with the students’ leadership, government and sponsors should provide sufficient <b>meal</b> and accomodation <b>allowances</b> on time, educate students about procedures of solving grievances, to have early warningsystem, improve infrastuctural learning environment, to establish an office for guidance and counselling, to revisit and implement recommendations by chancellor’s and TCU probe commissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. This study aimed to collect comprehensive information on all forms of resources (including income and assets) and indicative information on deprivation and style of living in order to define and measure poverty among {{a representative sample of}} the population of the United Kingdom. This major study was the result of fifteen years research. In 1964 the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust agreed to finance pilot studies on fatherless families, large families and unemployed and disabled people which were then to be followed by a national survey of poverty. In 1967 - 68, following pilot work, interviews were completed with 2, 052 households (6, 045 people), in 630 parliamentary constituencies throughout the United Kingdom. Another 1, 514 households (3, 539 people), were later interviewed in a poor area of Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales to secure information about the populations of the poorest areas. There were mixed reactions to the book's publication in 1979. The concept of relative deprivation provoked much discussion but the issue of multiple deprivation experienced by individuals and families was largely ignored. Comparatively little attention was paid to certain forms of deprivation - such as deprivation at work and environmental or locational deprivation - although the report gave data about multiple deprivation drawn from 60 indicators. Nearly 50 years later this study was reanalysed in a project funded by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The 'Advancing Paradata' project looked at shifts and continuities in the social process of gathering household survey data about poverty. In part it does this through analysis of survey paradata from the 1968 Poverty in the UK survey. Paradata captures the gamut of by-products of the collection of survey data and is of interest in understanding and improving survey quality and costs. The main focus has been on automatically captured macro items, but this is now expanding to include interviewer-generated observations. For the 'Advancing Paradata' project, information available only on paper questionnaires at the UK Data Archive was converted into digitised form and related metadata was created. A sample of 100 survey booklets has been selected for this collection. These booklets were chosen because they have significant quantities of marginalia written on the booklets. These booklets are available via the UK Data Service QualiBank, an online tool for browsing, searching and citing the content of selected qualitative data collections held at the UK Data Service. Names of survey respondents have been removed to protect confidentiality. Main Topics : Variables: (i) Housing and living facilities: exact composition of household; adequacy of basic facilities; degree of overcrowding; deficiency of bedrooms; overall household facilities; degree of satisfaction with facilities and environment. (ii) Employment: 'work record' of each individual over previous twelve months; educational background. (iii) Occupational facilities and fringe benefits: type of facilities provided for indoor and outside employment; eligibility for fringe benefits (e. g. sick pay, occupational pension); value of fringe benefits in kind received during the year (e. g. meal vouchers, subsidised meals, use of vehicles). (iv) Current Monetary Income: information on total cash income in (a) previous week, (b) previous twelve months, from any source of each income unit in the household. Questions on earnings, income of self- employed, government social security benefits, and miscellaneous sources of income. Also questions on housing costs and house value. (v) Savings and assets: information on the value of savings and assets owned by the household, including housing and household or personal possessions. (vi) Health and disability: general assessment of health of household members; details of any illnesses or disabilities; capacity to undertake ordinary personal and household activities; (vii) Social services: utilisation of services including periods in hopital and visits to doctors and dentists. Information on welfare benefits received e. g. free school <b>meals,</b> educational maintenance <b>allowances.</b> (viii) Income in kind: questions on goods and services received in the previous twelve months from relatives and friends. (ix) Style of living: leisure time activities including holidays; questions on diet, clothing and fuel supply; assessment of own financial situation; arrangements for payment of housekeeping and bills; whether manage to have savings; feelings about 'poverty'. In addition to the questionnaire and data codebook, the documentation for this study also includes qualitative information of various kinds about the original survey, including interviewers' documents, sampling information, survey documents (including meeting notes), reports and papers. These items were originally held separately by Qualidata, and have been added to the study during 2002 to enhance the available documentation...|$|R
