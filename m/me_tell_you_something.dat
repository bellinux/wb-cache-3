500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E

We {{have lived in}} peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> In war, innocent people always suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek {{writes that}} Dark Willow is [...] "far {{from being a}} cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the {{momentum}} of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff." [...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E

Additionally Rowland reunited with former Destiny's Child bandmates Beyoncé and Michelle Williams for a song on the album, Rowland stressed that it was not a Destiny's Child reunion but rather a song by herself featuring Beyoncé and Williams.|$|E
