5|$|Roxas' {{personality}} changes significantly {{across the}} series {{due to the}} fact that when first introduced, he appears with fake memories that make him believe he is a common teenager, and spends most of his time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E
5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong's works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pig Sty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman's Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong's compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One Day for You), is sung in the background by Eva Huang {{at the end of}} the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang (劉家昌) in the 1970s, it tells of a girl's <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loved one, and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally {{ascribed}} to Moses himself, modern scholarship sees {{the book as}} initially {{a product of the}} Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), based on earlier written and oral traditions, with final revisions in the Persian post-exilic period (5th century BCE). Carol Meyers in her commentary on Exodus suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel's identity: <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment {{of the life of the}} community and the guidelines for sustaining it.|$|E
25|$|Arrested {{again on}} 23 September 1923, Bhupen was {{deported}} to Mandalay in Burma, where Subhash Bose was {{to join him}} soon after and offer him <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Revolutionist by Kropotkin that he had smuggled for Bhupen during his last trip to Europe. Even inside his solitary prison cell, Bhupen was contacted by some Burmese {{as well as a}} few Bengali revolutionaries absconding in Burma and, thanks to his guidance, they formed an important organisation with branches all over the country; they, along with their leader Jiten Ghosh, were arrested only in 1931, during the Burmese revolt.|$|E
25|$|The Curse of Kehama is an 1810 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{origins of the}} poem {{can be traced to}} Southey's schoolboy days when he suffered from insomnia, along with his <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dark and mysterious schoolmate that later formed the basis for one of the poem's villains. The poem was started in 1802 following the publication of Southey's epic Thalaba the Destroyer. After giving up on the poem for a few years, he returned to it after prompting by the poet Walter Savage Landor encouraged him to complete his work. When it was finally published, it sold more copies than his previous works.|$|E
