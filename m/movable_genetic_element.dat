40|$|A {{new species}} of copia-like <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> termed 17. 6 was {{identified}} in Drosophila melanogaster, and the nucleotide sequences of its long terminal repeats (LTRs) were determined. The LTRs of 17. 6 were not only homologous to those of 297, a sibling <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> of 17. 6, but also closely matched those of avian leukosis-sarcoma virus. This made it possible (i) to identify the nucleotide sequences in 17. 6 and 297 that correspond to the crucial regulatory sequences for both transcription and reverse transcription in avian leukosis-sarcoma virus and (ii) to divide the LTRs of these two elements into three regions, U 3, R, and U 5, like those of retrovirus proviruses. Similarity in sequence was also found {{to a certain extent}} in other copia-like elements. From these results, we postulate that copia-like movable genetic elements in Drosophila originated from infection of a progenitor Drosophila with a retrovirus from which the present-day avian leukosis-sarcoma virus was derived...|$|E
40|$|From a cloned {{library of}} Drosophila DNA, a {{recombinant}} phage was isolated which contained a nucleotide sequence homologous {{to both the}} histone gene and a <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element,</b> 297 [Saigo, K., Millstein, L. & Thomas, C. A., Jr. (1981) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 45, 815 - 827]. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the termini of 297 {{as well as its}} insertion site in the histone gene in the clone. Our results strongly suggest that (i) although 297 ends with typical long terminal repeats, integrated 297 is not bounded by 5 ' T-G [...] . C-A 3 ', dinucleotides commonly found at the very ends of integrated forms of other similar genetic elements, and (ii) the insertion of 297 occurred exactly within the T-A-T-A box for the H 3 histone gene containing T-A-T-A-T-A. The structures of the insertion sites of 297 were also examined by using two other recombinant clones of the histone gene. A 6 -base-pair-long segment, T-A-T-A-T-A, was again found to be present at the insertion sites of 297 in both clones. Based on these results, it was concluded that, at least within the histone gene cluster, the insertion of 297 was carried out in a site-specific fashion with T-A-T-A-T-A as the target sequence...|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage Mu {{is unique}} among {{bacterial}} viruses because it displays many characteristics of transposable elements; it can integrate at random locations in host DNA, {{it uses a}} transposition mechanism to replicate its DNA, and it can cause the same DNA rearrange-ments (inversions, deletions, duplications, and trans-positions) associated with <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> (for a review, see Toussaint and Resibois 1983). One {{way to look at}} Mu is as a giant transposable element capable of packaging itself into phage particles. As with all transposable elements, the transposition pro-cess of Mu must be regulated to ensure the survival of the host population, since uncontrolled transposition would inevitably lead to the destruction of the host ge-netic material.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} by which mammary tumor virus (MTV) or other etrovirus DNAs integrate into host genomes; it is intriguing, however, that the integrated proviruses are organized in a fashion strikingly reminiscent of bacterial transposons and cer-tain <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in eukaryotes (Calos and Miller 1980; Shimotohno et al. 1980; J.

40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{tetracycline}} resistance was studied in 25 clinical isolates of Listeria monocytogenes. Resistance to tetracycline {{was associated with}} resistance to minocycline and due {{to the presence of}} the tet(M) gene in 24 strains. Association of tet(M) with int-Tn, the gene encoding the protein required for the movements of Tn 1545 -like conjugative transposons, was found in all strains. Cotransfer of tet(M) and int-Tn among L. monocytogenes cells and from L. monocytogenes to Enterococcus faecalis was detected in 7 of the 12 strains studied at frequencies similar to those obtained with the prototype element Tn 1545. tet(L), the second most prevalent tetracycline resistance gene in enterococci and streptococci, was detected in the remaining strain, where it was borne by a 5 -kb plasmid. These observations indicate that two types of <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> transposons and plasmids, in enterococci and streptococci are responsible for emergence of drug resistance in L. monocytogenes...|$|R
40|$|The glycopeptide-resistance {{transferability}} from vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) {{of clinical}} and animal origin to {{different species of}} Listeria was investigated. Of 36 matings, performed on membrane filter, the glycopeptide resistance was successfully transferred in six attempts, five with donors of animal origin and only one with donors from clinical source. The acquired glycopeptide resistance in Listeria transconjugants was confirmed {{by the presence of}} the conjugative plasmid band and by the amplification of the 732 -bp fragment of vanA gene in transferred plasmids. Despite the lower number of bacteria used in this study, the source of enterococci influenced the outcome of mating. Moreover transferred VanA plasmid induced a different expression in Listeria transconjugants, suggesting that gene expression might be influenced by species affiliation of recipients. Our data strengthen the opinion that enterococci are an important source of resistance genes for Listeria via the transfer of <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements.</b> As these strains are commonly found in the same habitats, a horizontal spread of glycopeptide resistance in Listeria spp. could be possible...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{the general}} view of {{heredity}} {{has been seen}} {{through the lens of}} DNA. Indeed, the 2003 Symposium on “The Genome of Homo sapiens” contributed to that view by emphasizing the importance of DNA sequence and its origins. But increasingly, investigators are exploring a set of secondary phenomena that give rise to heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the underlying DNA sequence—epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, imprinting, RNA interference, gene silencing, and paramutation. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are important contributors to the pathogenesis of disease in humans, animals, and plants and may {{lie at the heart of}} many important gene–environment interactions. And so it seemed timely to hold a Symposium explicitly devoted to “Epigenetics. ” Previous Symposia that have in part examined the role of the macromolecular context in which the primary genetic information is found include the 1941 Symposium on “Genes and Chromosomes: Structure and Organization,” which emphasized a biophysical approach to these structures; the two closely separated Symposia that examined “Chromosome Structure and Function” (1973) and “Chromatin” (1977), at which latter meeting the nature of the nucleosome was unveiled; and the 1993 Symposium on “DNA and Chromosomes,” by which time the human genome project with its focus on the primary sequence was well underway. The 69 th Symposium, however, was the first to fully explore the heritable aspects to these and related biochemical phenomena. The field of epigenetics as we know it today was prominently introduced at the 1951 Symposium on “Genes and Mutations. ” There, Ed Lewis presented data on position effect variegation in Drosophila, a phenomenon that has played an important role in the history of the field. Equally importantly, Barbara McClintock presented her ideas about heterochromatin and <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> the so-called Ac-Ds system in maize that opened up understanding of transposition and its links to gene silencing and formation of heterochromatin. Some 53 years later, the 69 th Symposium witnessed a rather complete molecular description of her ideas, including links to RNAi...|$|R
40|$|All the {{processes}} {{that take place in}} a cell require one or more proteins, meaning that they are essential components of life. Proteins are macromolecules consisting of amino acid units, all of them being constructed with combinations of only 20 amino acids. The primary structure of a protein molecule is determined by the sequence of amino acids connected by peptide bonds forming a polypeptide chain. Once the amino acid chain is synthesized, the protein folds by a physical process that might be eventually assisted by other proteins, reaching its characteristic three&# 8208;dimensional structure that is the final, functional conformation. However, although it is known that all the proteins must properly fold into their correct native conformation to be functional, their final conformation cannot be predicted from their primary amino acid sequence, being protein folding mechanisms one of the most challenging problems in biology today. Many proteins of relevant industrial or medical value are produced in low amounts in their natural sources. However, {{at the end of the}} seventies, the development of recombinant DNA technologies opened a new promising era for protein production in high amounts for both research and industrial applications. This had a tremendous impact, for example, in many areas of medicine as a tool to produce new drugs for the treatment of diseases and genetic disorders. Genetic engineering permits the introduction of the encoding genes of the protein of interest into recipient cells, where these genes are positioned downstream of regulable promoters in <b>movable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> mainly plasmids. Under suitable conditions, these transgenic cells acting as protein production bio&# 8208;factories would be expected to act as unlimited and inexpensive source of rare, highly valuable proteins not only for proteomics and structural functional genomics 1 but also for large&# 8208;scale preparative purposes. The quality as well as the quantity of the produced recombinant protein is greatly influenced by the chosen biological cell system. Bacteria have been the most commonly used organisms for protein production, specially the enterobacteria Escherichia coli, not only for the low cost of the used processes, but also for its fast growth. Generally, in Escherichia coli, the rather small host cell proteins can fold properly, adopting a native, biological active conformation. However, when producing heterologous proteins, specially those with eukaryotic or viral origin, important obstacles appear during the protein production process: a) in most cases, the protein is produced in a non functional conformation; b) sometimes the formed product is toxic for the cell; c) the protein often results proteolytically degraded 2; d) the product is accumulated as an insoluble, non&# 8208;functional protein aggregates, known as inclusion bodies 3. Therefore, even though the important advantages of the use of bacteria as a expression system, Escherichia coli also presents some drawbacks, such as its inability to carry most of the post&# 8208;transcriptional modifications, often required for eukaryotic protein function, the lack of a secretion mechanism to release the protein to the medium, and the inability to create an oxidative environment to facilitate disulfide bond formation required to achieve the final, functional structure of some proteins. Therefore, this leads to the production of proteins which are not always suitable for immediate use. This means that, to date, many proteins have been excluded from the biotechnological and pharmaceutical market because they cannot be produced in high yields as soluble and active products. To avoid protein folding problems encountered in bacteria under overexpression conditions, mainly secretion and post&# 8208;transcriptional modifications, alternative host cells, such as yeast, filamentous fungi, mammalian or insect cells, have been explored. Nevertheless, an enormous number of deficiencies in these systems such as difficulty of genetic manipulation, low productivity and high costs, shows that these organisms are not ideal for this aim and that, even when bacteria show some obstacles in the production process and often this system has to be optimized for specific products, it is, in most of the cases, the best choice...|$|R
