40|$|An {{analysis}} and system study {{was performed to}} provide design information regarding lubricant and coolant flow rates and flow paths for effective utilization of the lubricant and coolant in a once-through oil-mist (microfog) and coolant air system. A system was designed, manufactured, coupled with an existing rig and evaluation tests were performed using 46 mm bore split-inner angular-contact ball bearings under 1779 N (400 lb.) thrust load. An emergency lubrication aspirator system was also manufactured and tested under lost lubricant conditions. The testing demonstrated the feasibility of using a mist oil and cooling air system to lubricate and cool a high speed helicopter engine <b>mainshaft</b> <b>bearing.</b> The testing also demonstrated the feasibility of using an emergency aspirator lubrication system as a viable survivability concept for helicopter mainshaft engine bearing for periods as long as 30 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Some terrible {{disasters}} of aircrafts {{were caused}} by inadequate lubrication or interruption of lubricant delivery of the gas turbine engine <b>mainshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper introduces {{the design of the}} test equipment, performs the experiments of failure performance for 51306 coated bearings to respond to oil interruption under the actual situation. The main failure performance of test coated bearings has been demonstrated to be the cage damage of the test coated bearing. The failure mechanism model of the damaged cage of test coated bearings under oil interruption condition is established for the failure analysis of damage cages. The failure mechanism of the damaged cages is revealed. The main reason for the damages of test coated bearing cages under lubricant interruption condition is that the perpendicular component force acted on the cage increases continually to go with the increase of the friction force between the balls and the cage due to inadequate lubrication until the cage is broken...|$|R

40|$|Four {{candidate}} lubricants {{for next}} generation aircraft gas turbine application were tested under open atmosphere conditions in a rig simulating an advanced engine 125 mm bore <b>mainshaft</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> position. Testing {{was conducted at}} speeds to 24, 000 rpm (3, 000, 000 bearing DN), bearing ring temperature of 500 F, and with 1200 F air and 100 psi differential pressure across the seals installed in a dual tandem arrangement. Test bearing was a 125 mm bore split inner ring, outer race riding {{angular contact ball bearing}} under a 3280 lb. thrust load. One lubricant, a type 2 ester, performed extremely well. The mainshaft seal limited the performance. Numerous design improvements for this seal were indicated...|$|R
40|$|Two used {{turbopump}} <b>mainshaft</b> support <b>bearings</b> {{were examined}} to determine steps {{needed to achieve}} turbopump lifetimes of 27, 000 seconds. The two bearings, which had been run in a high pressure oxygen turbopump, are angular contact ball bearings, applied as a preloaded pair, locked to the shaft, inner race rotating, with the outer races unrestrained axially. Examination showed that both bearings had been subjected to overloads, leading to fatigue spalling on the races and balls and advanced retainer wear. This is clear evidence of unintended high internal loads in the high pressure oxygen pump which would lead to complete bearing failure and extensive secondary pump damage. Action {{must be taken to}} reduce the applied bearing loads or to incorporate bearings of sufficient size to withstand the high loads...|$|R
50|$|The car {{features}} a supercharged 6.2L LSA engine with 1.9L supercharger @ 7psi SAE-rated at 580 horsepower (426.59 kW) and 556 lb.-ft. of torque (754 Nm) - {{making it the}} most-powerful production Camaro ever. Power is delivered to the rear wheels by either a six-speed manual TR-6060 or the 6L90 automatic transmission. The manual has a stronger output shaft, a more robust rear housing, and an additional <b>mainshaft</b> roller <b>bearing</b> to provide 30-percent more torque capacity than the automatic transmission used in the Camaro SS. To improve shift quality, there are triple synchros in some gears and a revised linkage. A new dual-mass flywheel is bolted to a high-capacity twin-disc clutch. The automatic has additional clutch plates, a strengthened output shaft, and is programmed with three operating modes (Drive/Sport/Manual).|$|R
40|$|The <b>mainshaft</b> support <b>bearings</b> of {{long life}} turbopumps {{for use on}} the space shuttle were {{evaluated}} to determine possible causes of failure. Specific aspects examined include the sensitivity of 15 degree versus 25 degree contact angle bearings with regard to heat damage and thermal runaway, the L/D aspects of the turbine end bearing pair with regard to hang-up due to cocking, the hang-up required to support a 44. 5 KN axial load without cartridge slipping, the outer race growth {{as a result of}} a 44. 5 KN axial load, and bearing torque as a function of axial load. Results indicate that hang-up of the cartridge due to bearing heating is a serious problem especially if poor lubrication of the bearing occurs and that race growth due to axial load can contribute to cartridge lock-up. The experimental evaluation of bearing performance under axial loads indicates that the bearing torque is a strong function of surface lubrication...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor high-precision {{mechanical}} {{systems such as}} gas-turbine engines that operate under extreme conditions, it is particularly important to accurately predict {{the behavior of the}} <b>mainshaft</b> rolling <b>bearings.</b> This prediction includes, among others, the load distribution, stiffness, and power dissipation. Although the shaft speeds tends to increase, rings and shaft are becoming thinner due to size and weight constraints. Thus, the bearing behavior is now dependent on the housing and ring stiffness. Furthermore, the use of a squeeze film damper (SFD) is widespread in gas-turbine engines to significantly reduce the vibratory levels. In this case, a single thin ring provides the interface between the bearing rolling elements and the fluid film. Due to the flexibility of this ring, an elastic coupling occurs modifying the behavior of the bearing-SFD system. A global flexible bearing-SFD assembly model is proposed in this paper. Large deformations can occur, resulting in a contact between the ring common to the bearing and the SFD and its housing. To reproduce this interference, an effective mechanical stop model is also proposed. The behavior of an industrial bearing-SFD assembly is then investigated for different operating conditions. The presented results show that this coupling has a first-order influence on the behavior of the bearing-SFD system. It is also shown that such elastic coupling introduces a dissymmetry of the load distribution with respect to the applied load direction. Moreover, in certain cases, the position of the bearing in its housing can reach eccentricities larger than the radial clearance of the SF...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} energy demand in Nepal and its {{neighbouring}} countries, the focuson hydropower development in Nepal has increased. As a consequence, the TurbineTesting Laboratory (TTL) at Kathmandu University (KU) has been developed to handleperformance testing of model turbines. However, the laboratory is not yet equipped witha test rig which can handle model tests according to the specications of the international standard for model tests of hydraulic turbines, IEC 60193. This master's thesis {{is one of the}} first stages towards the aim of developing turbine model test rigs in compliance with IEC 60193 at TTL. The objective of this project is to design a Francis model test rig for TTL, using theFrancis test rig at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU as the initial design. The rigmust full the accuracy requirements of IEC 60193 and it should be capable of acomplete performance test for dierent sized turbines. The pressure tank and the draft tube tank are designed to have the same shape as thetanks at the Waterpower Laboratory, but with some difference in volume. The <b>mainshaft</b> and <b>bearing</b> block will include systems to measure the speed of rotation, axialthrust, generator torque, and friction torque without the need of a hydraulic system. The guide vane angles are manually controlled and measured by a rotary encoder. The pressure dierence between inlet and outlet is measured by dierential pressuretransducers, calibrated by a deadweight manometer. The flow rate is measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter which is calibrated using the volumetric method. At theoutlet to the pumps, the temperature, oxygen level and pressure of the water is measured. 3 D CAD drawings of the nal design are presented in this thesis. The most practicaland space efficient placement of the test rig in the laboratory has been chosen basedon discussions with the sta at NTNU and KU. The rig has been integrated in themain pipe system, and designed for both open and closed loop modes. Procedures foreciency measurements have also been developed. The work done in this thesis is an input to the EnergizeNepal project on developing aFrancis model test rig at TTL. </p...|$|R
