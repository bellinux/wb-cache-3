40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{temperatures}} on {{the viability of}} rumen protozoa was studied. In Trial 1, samples of mixed rumen contents were diluted and cultured at 38, 15 and 5 °C for 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively. Viability of Isotrichidae was not affected by either the length of incubation or the temperature (P < 0. 10). Incubation at low temperatures negatively affected the viability of Entodinium, Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolex. Differences between 15 and 5 °C were not significant except for Entodinium spp. (P = 0. 07). The reduction of viability increased with time, this effect being noticeable (P < 0. 10) for Entodinium (after 4 and 6 h), Diplodiniinae (at 6 h) and Ophryoscolex (at 2 and 6 h). Preservation of mixed rumen protozoa for at least 4 h at 15 or 5 °C did not markedly affect viability, suggesting that cultures can be recovered after short-term refrigeration. In Trial 2, monocultures of Entodinium caudatum and Diploplastron (Metadinium) affine were cultured at 5 °C for 4, 8 and 24 h with or without milk powder/egg yolk solution as a <b>membrane</b> <b>protector.</b> For both species, viability was not affected after 4 h at 5 °C, but decreased from 8 h onwards (P < 0. 01). The use of a <b>membrane</b> <b>protector</b> improved viability of D. affine at all time periods (P < 0. 05), but only at 24 h for E. caudatum (P = 0. 07), showing {{that the use of}} <b>membrane</b> <b>protector</b> may be positive at medium or long exposure to low temperatures, depending on the species.

40|$|The {{influence}} of three pharmaceutical preparations on photo-induced lysis (irradiation with light-emitting diode of 653 nm) of human erythrocytes {{in the presence}} of photosensitizer radachlorin and also on the quantum yield of radachlorin photobleaching was studied. Both processes are mediated by singlet oxygen generation and therefore can become a target for antioxidant or prooxidant regulation. The pyridine preparation mexidol (action principle – 3 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 2 -ethylpyridine succinate) in concentration of 152 µM used as an antioxidant and a <b>membrane</b> <b>protector</b> and aminazine (action principle – chlorpromazine) in concentration of 70 µM many times accelerated manyfold the photo-induced hemolysis. However only mexidol increased the quantum yield of radachlorin photobleaching in many times. The obtained data showed the direct prooxidant action of mexidol, but not aminazine that accelerated a photo-induced hemolysis due to other mechanism. A pyridine preparation nicotinic acid tested in equimolar to mexidol concentration, failed to influence both the velocity of the photo-induced hemolysis and the quantum yield of radachlorin photobleaching. Our study shows the possible use of a photobleaching tests for detection of the direct prooxidant action...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} had the {{aimed at}} evaluating {{the effects of}} the progressive water deficit, as well as investigating the physiological and biochemical behavior in Glycine max cv. Sambaiba submitted to water restriction during the vegetative phase. The parameters that were measured are the leaf relative water content, plant dry matter, proline, total soluble carbohydrate, sucrose, reducing carbohydrates, free amino acids and total soluble proteins. The experimental design carried out was at entirely randomized factorial scheme, with 2 water regimes (stress and control) and 4 evaluation points (0, 2, 4 and 6 days). There was decrease in the leaf relative water content in plants under water deficit, however the total soluble carbohydrates, sucrose and reducing carbohydrates were increased at 40, 205. 0, 19. 2 %, respectively, besides the accumulation of proline and free amino acids at 67 and 388. 1 %, respectively. Significant changes were shown on leaf relative water content, total soluble carbohydrates, sucrose and reducing carbohydrates with 2 days under water stress, indicating that the carbon metabolism is quickly modified and utilized as reserve source and <b>membrane</b> <b>protector</b> during the water deficit. Besides of this, the increase in free amino acids level occurred due to protein breakdown as consequence of the stress submitted to plants, however significant changes were not observed on the proline levels until the 4 th day of water restriction. This fact reveals the inefficient osmotic adjustment and as consequence the high sensitivity of this species under conditions of water restriction...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{no single}} plant completes its life cycle without encountering {{environmental}} stress. When plant cells surpass stress threshold stimuli, chemically {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) are generated that can cause oxidative damage or act as signals. Plants have developed numerous ROS-scavenging systems to minimize the cytotoxic effects of ROS. The role of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (SOS), including fructans and the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), is well established during stress physiology. They are believed to act as important <b>membrane</b> <b>protectors</b> in planta. So far a putative role for sucrose and SOS during oxidative stress has largely been neglected, as has {{the contribution of the}} vacuolar compartment. Recent studies suggest a link between SOS and oxidative defence and/or scavenging. SOS might be involved in stabilizing membrane-associated peroxidases and NADPH oxidases, and SOS-derived radicals might fulfil an intermediate role in oxido-reduction reactions taking place in the vicinity of membranes. Here, these emerging features are discussed and perspectives for future research are provided. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{general the}} first part of this study dealt with some of the {{theoretical}} considerations in relation to history, epidemiology, genetics, clinical and standard treatment of Homozygous b- Thalassemia, Major form, as followed in the Hematology Dept., Hospital D. Estefania. In the second part we decribe the alterations in the erythrocytic membrane in b-Thalassemia mechanism and importance of lipidoperoxidation, in this hemoglobinopathy outlining the action of antioxidant agents as <b>membrane</b> <b>protectors.</b> The last part of this research study is experimental. Twenty four patients were studied, 18 with homozygous bdeg Thalassemia, Major form, and 6 with the associated sickle-bdeg Thalassemia, most of them originating from Central and Southern Portugal, submited during one year to the standard treatment A and during the following year the standard treatment B, equal in all respects, (hypertranfusion programs, iron chelation, splenectomy and other side therapies), execpet in the simulteneous association of two antioxidant medications, Cantaxantine (oral daily dose of 50 to 70 mg) and Vitamin E (oral daily dose of 500 to 1. 000 mg) administered in standard treatment B. The results obtained showed an important role of lipidoperoxidation in Thalassemia syndromes and a failure in physiological processes of control and resistance to tjhe free radicals produced in excess, in these clinical situations, that result in a diminishement of the half life of the erythrocytes and lead to an early hemolysis due to failure of membrane functions. We would also point out the benefits of the use of antioxidant medications, during treatment B, in the resistance to lipidoperoxidation present in these syndromes. We evaluated, as an indication of lipidoperoxidation, the erythrocytic MDA-the stable product resulting form lipidic breakdown of lipids from thelassemic erythrocytic membrane - the uricemia and the tocopherolemia. The results obtained from teatment Groups "a and B" and a Control Group of normal individuals, were analyzed using Student t test. The MDA levels, found in treatment Group A were significant much higher in relation to these of treatment group B [853, 7 n moles/grHb- 521, 1 n moles/ grHb (p< 0, 0019] whereas no significant variations were observed betweem MDA levels of treatment group B and the control Group, [521, 1 n moles/grHb- 406, 7 n moles/grHb(pNS) ]. The levels of uricemie obtained from treatment Group A were significantly less than those of treatment Group B [3, 7 mg/dl- 4, 9 mg/dl (p< 0, 001) ]. No significant variations were found between observations of treatment B and the control Group [4, 9 mg/dl 5, 1 mg/dl (p-NS) ]. The levels of tocopherolomie in treatment Group A were significantly lower in comparison to treatment Group B [0, 18 mg/dl- 1, 34 mg/dl (p< 0, 001) ] and also in relation to the control group [0, 18 mg- 0, 71 mg/dl (p< 0, 0019]. The levels of the annual average /Hb were higher during treatment group B the average different being 1, 44 hr/dl (annual average/Hb: 10, 52 gr/dl in treatment A; 11, 96 gr/dl in treatment group B), maintaining an equal annual use of blood, which is confirmed by the normalization of osmotic globular resistance, and an increase of the half-life erythricites, assessed by Cr" 51 [half life 16, 1 dyas for treatment group A and 20, 8 days in treatment group B (p< 0, 001) ]. We determined that the use of antioxidants during treatment B, originated a notable decrease of the lipidoperoxidation phenomenon, which is normally increased in all patients, proved by: - Normalization of the levels of the erythrocytic MDA in relation to the initial levels and to those of the normal individuals. - Increase of uricemie and tocopherolemie - Increase of the half-life of erythrocytes with consequent increase of the annual average hemoglobin, for an annual blood inatake main-taining the same quantities and frequencyAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} The need is high {{to search for}} natural {{compounds}} with superior prebiotic, antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties for use in (food) applications. Raffinose Family Oligosaccharides (RFOs) show such properties. Moreover, they contribute to stress tolerance in plants acting as putative membrane stabilizers, antioxidants and signalling agents. Methods A large scale soluble carbohydrate screening was performed within the plant kingdom. An unknown compound accumulated to a high extent in early spring red deadnettle (Lamium purpureum) but not in other RFO plants. The compound was purified and its structure was unravelled with NMR. Organs and organ parts of red deadnettle were carefully dissected and analysed on soluble sugars. Phloem sap content was analysed by a common EDTA-based method. Key results Early spring red deadnettle stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisaccharide manninotriose (Galα 1, 6 Galα 1, 6 Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Galα 1, 6 Galα 1, 6 Glcα 1, 2 βFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections together with phloem sap analyses strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbohydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in red deadnettle are discussed. Conclusions Here it is demonstrated {{for the first time}} that manninotriose is a novel and important player in the RFO metabolism of red dead deadnettle. It is proposed that manninotriose represents a temporal storage carbohydrate in early spring deadnettle, at the same time perhaps functioning as a <b>membrane</b> <b>protector</b> and/or as an antioxidant in the vicinity of membranes as recently suggested for other RFOs and fructans. This novel finding urges further research on this peculiar carbohydrate on a broader array of RFO accumulators. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Lead (Pb) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} occurring, highly persistent and widely distributed heavy metal contaminants in the environment. It has a tendency to bioaccumulate in animals and plants, and potentially, it is able to enter the human food chain where it poses a hazard to public health. Generally, conventional remediation technologies applied to decontaminate heavy metals from groundwater and soils are very costly. Hence, phytoremediation has emerged as an ecologically friendly and economically attractive technology that uses green plants to clean up heavy metal contaminated sites. However, a lack of knowledge of the biological processes associated with plant responses to Pb (e. g. Pb uptake, accumulation, translocation, and tolerance) has been a bottleneck for the application of Pb phytoremediation in the field. A model genetic system of higher plants, Arabidopsis thaliana, was selected to further examine the physiological, biochemical and molecular events occuring in plants under Pb stress. The overall aim of this project was to obtain a better understanding of plant responses to Pb contaminants in the early developmental stages of A. thaliana seedlings. This research encompassed the physiological responses of A. thaliana seedlings to Pb exposure, monitoring their antioxidative defence systems, and investigating the participation of annexin 1 in the response to Pb-mediated oxidative stress. This research also assessed the protective effect of nitric oxide on Pb-induced toxicity of A. thaliana seedlings and it isolated a putative Pb tolerant mutant from an EMS-mutagenized M 2 population. A multiexperimental approach was adopted to achieve these objectives. A. thaliana seedlings were grown on modified Huang & Cunningham (1996) nutrient solution containing 0. 8 % (w/v) agar, with and without Pb(NO 3) 2, under controlled conditions. A. thaliana seedlings were insensitive to Pb during seed germination. In treatments with up to 200 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂, morphological changes and inhibition of root growth were observed in the 7 -d-old seedlings. A tolerance index revealed that Pb(NO₃) ₂ concentration of 75 μM and higher brought about more than 50 % root growth inhibition. Pb was predominantly retained in the roots. Analysis using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy indicated that the level of Pb accumulation in A. thaliana roots was greatly dependent on the Pb(NO₃) ₂ concentrations, but only a small fraction of the accumulated Pb was translocated to the shoots (18 - 43 %). Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that Pb was mainly immobilized in the cell walls and intercellular spaces. This was interpreted as a mechanism that minimizes the entry of Pb into cells and interference with cellular functions. Pb that gained entry into the cytoplasm was sequestered into the vacuoles. The toxicity of Pb in the cytosol of A. thaliana seedlings was studied by measuring the H₂O₂ and lipid hydroperoxide levels using a microplate reader. When the Pb(NO₃) ₂ concentration in the growth medium was 100 μM, the 7 -d-old seedlings contained 2. 2 -fold higher H₂O₂ and 9. 6 -fold higher lipid hydroperoxide than the control without Pb(NO₃) ₂. This was followed by an up-regulation of the activity of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and general peroxidase (POD) by 2. 1 -, 3. 2 -, 2. 3 -, 1. 8 - and 4. 6 -fold, respectively, compared with the control. Pb toxicity is known to trigger oxidative stress, but A. thaliana seedlings appeared to be capable of activating cell rescue, defending themselves against harmful oxidative stress and also acclimating to Pb. Data from physiological and biochemical analysis indicate that a combination of avoidance and tolerance mechanisms exists in Pb-treated A. thaliana seedlings to maintain the essential cellular metabolism for survival. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to show the involvement of AnnAt 1 in the response of 7 -d-old A. thaliana seedlings to a high threshold concentration of Pb. When the seedlings were treated with 100 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂, AnnAt 1 message levels were up-regulated by 2. 12 -fold. Pb-mediated oxidative stress may be a component of AnnAt 1 gene expression. AnnAt 1 potentially could be invoked to reduce the toxic effects of Pb stress by acting as ROS and/or Ca²⁺ signals, as a <b>membrane</b> <b>protector,</b> in detoxification of excessive ROS, or in sequestration of Pb. Pb stress symptoms were less evident in seedlings pre-treated with 1 mM sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor. The present study found that exogenous NO did not alter Pb transport into the plants or efflux pumping of Pb at the plasma membrane. However, NO conferred protection to 7 -d-old A. thaliana seedlings primarily by acting as an antioxidant or a signal for actions to scavenge excessive ROS level. The application of exogenous NO before subjecting to 100 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂ decreased H₂O₂ back to its original level, and reduced 50 % lipid hydroperoxide in the Pb-treated seedlings. As a result, the antioxidative enzyme activities in Pb-exposed seedlings pre-treated with SNP were 23 - 45 % lower than those without SNP pre-treatment. Less antioxidative enzyme activities were probably needed to counteract the reduced amount of Pb-induced ROS in A. thaliana seedlings. A post-germination procedure involving prolonged exposure to 150 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂ was developed to screen an EMS-mutagenized M 2 population of A. thaliana. Potential Pb tolerant mutants were selected based on the ability to grow with their roots penetrating into the medium and maintain purple-green leaves without wilting. A minority of the survivors appeared to go into a resting stage and they seemed to have altered transporters that prevented Pb from entering the cells. Only one putative Pb mutant (M 3 - 1) was recovered from the rescue and set seeds. The M₄ generation of this putative Pb mutant was re-screened for phenotypic confirmation and to determine the regulation of AnnAt 1. The 7 -d-old putative Pb mutant seemed to display enhanced root and shoot growth in the presence of 150 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂ compared to the wild-type seedlings. The transcript level of AnnAt 1 in this putative Pb tolerant mutant increased by 2. 19 -fold when exposed to 150 μM Pb(NO₃) ₂...|$|E
