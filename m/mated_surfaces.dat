50|$|Although {{the whole}} {{workpiece}} may be {{inserted into the}} die, the sizing operation can give dimensional accuracy to {{a portion of the}} part based on the contact with the die. Sizing is mostly used to give a forged or cast part better dimensional accuracy. <b>Mated</b> <b>surfaces</b> between touching parts like gears are often sized. The sizing operation also provides a better surface hardness and finish to the workpiece. Also, the sized surface of the workpiece gets denser and stronger when the operation is performed. The dimensional tolerance of the operation is about 0.025 mm. Primary pressing or a compacting die are typically used when sizing small batches of compact. To keep costs down, larger batches of compact usually have a specialized die made specifically for the operation.|$|E

As the pistol is being fired and the recoil of the pistol is in motion, a lug and groove system around the barrel rotate the barrel 20Â° until a lug hits a stop wedge and holds the barrel while the slide is free to continue its rearward travel, the extractor claw withdrawing the spent casing against the breech face of the slide until the casing strikes the ejector and departs the weapon via the ejection and loading port. Shortly after ejection the slide's rearward travel is arrested by the compressed recoil spring and the abutment of <b>mated</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the slide and frame. The recoil spring is now free to return its stored energy to the cycle of the weapon by beginning to return the slide forward.|$|E

40|$|Automotive {{electrical}} connectors {{are critical}} for safe and efficient operation of a vehicle. However, their durability is limited by fretting-corrosion. This type of surface damage is observed between two <b>mated</b> <b>surfaces</b> subjected to vibrations and thermal cycling. Such conditions occur during normal vehicle operation causing two parts of an electrical contact to move in relation to each other with high frequency and small displacement amplitude -Typically tens or hundreds of microns. This generates damage of both surfaces, wear particles arc produced and subsequently oxidised in air atmosphere. As a result, an oxide film is formed at the interface, which isolates both surfaces and increases electrical resistivity leading to the contact failure. It is shown in this study, how electrical contact durability can be extended by a surface design approach, which controls the metallic interface and assures low contact resistance. The approach links imposed surface geometry to the progressive process of interface oxidation. A relationship between surface roughness and electrical contact durability has been observed...|$|E
40|$|Fretting wear is an {{accumulation}} of damage that occurs at component interfaces that are subjected to high contact stresses coupled with low amplitude oscillation. The key to fretting wear reduction in metallic contacts is the mitigation of galling at the interface, followed by the control of debris production and the rheology of active wear debris. Once the thin surface species of the metallic interfaces is dispersed, adhesion between the contacting nascent surfaces causes the inception of severe surface deformation and material transfer or removal. This is extremely apparent in the fretting wear of aerospace materials such as titanium alloy and nickel alloy contacts. However, the literature suggests that nickel alloy contacts perform very well in sliding and reciprocating wear contacts at elevated temperatures due {{to the formation of}} what is often called a Glaze oxide layer. The current state of literature describes the composition of the glaze layer as NiO. The focus of this dissertation was to provide experimentation and analysis of temperature effects on the lubricious tribofilm formation that occurs in nickel contacts. This was accomplished by testing commercially pure nickel coatings and thick nickel oxide surfaces. The enhanced understanding of the fretting performance of nickel oxides aided in the development of nickel graphite based self-lubricating coatings. These coatings were then proved to reduce fretting wear damage within Ti 6 Al 4 V <b>mated</b> <b>surfaces</b> over a wide temperature range...|$|E

40|$|For commercial, military, and {{aerospace}} applications, low-cost, small, reliable, and lightweight gas and liquid hermetically sealed valves with post initiation on/off capability are highly desirable for pressurized systems. Applications include remote fire suppression, single-use system-pressurization systems, spacecraft propellant systems, and in situ instruments. Current pyrotechnic- activated rupture disk hermetic valves {{were designed for}} physically larger systems and are heavy and integrate poorly with portable equipment, aircraft, and small spacecraft and instrument systems. Additionally, current pyrotechnically activated systems impart high g-force shock loads to surrounding components and structures, which {{increase the risk of}} damage and can require additional mitigation. The disclosed mechanism addresses the need for producing a hermetically sealed micro-isolation valve for low and high pressure for commercial, aerospace, and spacecraft applications. High-precision electrical discharge machining (EDM) parts allow for the machining of mated parts with gaps less than a thousandth of an inch. These high-precision parts are used to support against pressure and extrusion, a thin hermetically welded diaphragm. This diaphragm ruptures from a pressure differential when the support is removed and/or when the plunger is forced against the diaphragm. With the addition of conventional seals to the plunger and a two-way actuator, a derivative of this design would allow nonhermetic use as an on/off or metering valve after the initial rupturing of the hermetic sealing disk. In addition, in a single-use hermetically sealed isolation valve, the valve can be activated without the use of potential leak-inducing valve body penetrations. One implementation of this technology is a high-pressure, high-flow-rate rupture valve that is self-rupturing, which is advantageous for high-pressure applications such as gas isolation valves. Once initiated, this technology is self-energizing and requires low force compared to current pyrotechnic-based burst disk hermetic valves. This is a novel design for producing a single-use, self-rupturing, hermetically sealed valve for isolation of pressurized gas and/or liquids. This design can also be applied for single-use disposable valves for chemical instruments. A welded foil diaphragm is fully supported by two <b>mated</b> <b>surfaces</b> that are machined to micron accuracies using EDM. To open the valve, one of the surfaces is moved relative to the other to (a) remove the support creating an unsupported diaphragm that ruptures due to over pressure, and/or (b) produce tension in the diaphragm and rupture it...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} contact conductance {{between two}} <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> a conductive tape {{has been developed}} by growing dense arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs, graphite layers folded into cylinders) {{on both sides of}} a thermally conductive metallic foil. When the two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> are brought into contact with the conductive tape in between, the CNT arrays will adhere to the <b>mating</b> <b>surface.</b> The van der Waals force between the contacting tubes and the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> provides adhesion between the two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Even though the thermal contact conductance of a single tube-to-tube contact is small, the tremendous amount of CNTs on the surface leads to a very large overall contact conductance. Interface contact thermal resistance rises from the microroughness and the macroscopic non-planar quality of <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> When two surfaces come into contact with each other, the actual contact area may be much less than the total area of the surfaces. The real area of contact depends on the load, the surface roughness, and the elastic and inelastic properties of the surface. This issue is even more important at cryogenic temperatures, where materials become hard and brittle and vacuum is used, which prevents any gas conduction through the interstitial region. A typical approach to increase thermal contact conductance is to use thermally conducting epoxies or greases, which are not always compatible with vacuum conditions. In addition, the thermal conductivities of these compounds are often relatively low. The CNTs used in this approach can be metallic or semiconducting, depending on the folding angle and diameter. The electrical resistivity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been reported. MWCNTs can pass a current density and remain stable at high temperatures in air. The thermal conductivity of a MWCNT at room temperature is measured to be approximately 3, 000 W/m-K, which is much larger than that of diamond. At room temperature, the thermal conductance of a 0. 3 sq cm array of CNTs was measured to be as high as 10 W/K. The high thermal conductivity and the nanoscale size make CNTs ideal as thermal interface materials. The CNT-based thermal tape can be used for the thermal management of microelectronic packages and electronic systems. It also can be integrated with current device technology and packaging. The material would allow for an efficient method to manage excess heat generation without requiring any additional power. Lastly, the CNT tape can be used to enhance thermal contact conductance across two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> on some NASA missions...|$|R

The grinding angle (angle between direction of scratch and grinding marks) was varied between 0 deg and 90 deg during the scratch tests.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness R max= 0. 1 Âµm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness Rmax= 3. 0 Âµm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness.
