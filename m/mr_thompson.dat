By 9am the tide had risen through the ship and drowned all but two on board. The survivors, a seaman and a female servant of Lieutenant Key's wife, were brought away in safety.|$|E

Although Sunday was immediately smitten with her, both had serious on-going relationships that bordered on engagements. Furthermore, Nell Thompson had grown to maturity {{in a much more}} privileged environment than had Sunday, and her father strongly discouraged the courtship, viewing all professional baseball players as [...] "transient ne'er-do-wells who were unstable and destined to be misfits once they were too old to play." [...] Nevertheless, Sunday pursued and eventually married her. On several occasions, Sunday said, [...] "She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian. Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a Catholic — because I was hot on the trail of Nell." [...] Mrs. Thompson had liked Sunday from the start and weighed in on his side, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Thompson</b> finally relented. The couple was married on September 5, 1888.|$|E

2500|$|Under the old provisions, {{a person}} could change their {{enrollment}} up to seven days after {{the issue of the}} writs for an election. After the 2006 amendments {{a person could}} only change their enrollment 3 days after the issue of the writs for an election. In the context of the 2010 election this was Thursday 22 July. [...] The second plaintiff, Douglas Thompson, was enrolled as a voter in the Division of Wentworth. However, in March 2010 he had moved to a new address in the Division of Sydney. His change of enrollment form could have been lodged at any time prior to the announcement of the election, however it was not lodged with the AEC until after 8 pm on 22 July.

[...] Cuccinelli's spokesman said [...] "if <b>Mr.</b> <b>Thompson</b> was convicted of wrongdoing relative to the misappropriation of funds, and contributions to our campaign came from money that was supposed to go to active duty military or veterans, we would donate those contributions to military support organizations here in Virginia." [...] Sen. Don McEachin asserted that the standard for donations should be [...] "much higher than that." [...] A month later in June, a Cuccinelli spokesman said $55,500 would be set aside in a restricted account pending the outcome of the investigation into Thompson and USNVA. [...] On July 28, 2010, Cuccinelli announced that he will donate the $55,000 to veterans charities in Virginia. Cuccinelli stated that his decision was prompted by statements from Thompson's lawyers indicating that Thompson can no longer be located.|$|E
2500|$|W. T.

David Gough claimed [...] "the first documentary evidence of mining at Greenside" [...] was dated 1784, but also failed to say what that evidence was. Samuel Murphy discovered what he considered [...] "the first documentary evidence" [...] {{in the form of a}} barrister's brief of 1799, which referred to a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Thompson</b> who was working a mine at Greenside under the Duke of Norfolk. Murphy also found a reference to Greenside in William Green's guide book of 1819. The mines were said to be [...] "beside the road from Keswick to Patterdale" [...] and were [...] "till lately worked by William Sheffield Esquire," [...] the mineral agent to the Duke of Devonshire. The road mentioned is clearly the track over Sticks Pass, which passes the old workings at Greenside.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Thompson</b> {{slipped on}} a ramp while {{disembarking}} a train at 10pm, from Manchester to Darwen, and was injured. The train had pulled up {{just past the}} platform, and so the ramp she stepped out on was slippery. A special jury found the railway to have been negligent, and so <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thompson</b> sought damages for personal injury. She had been given an excursion ticket by her niece, which said ‘Excursion. For conditions see back’ which in turn referred to the Railway’s timetables and excursion bills. The timetables could be bought for sixpence said the tickets were issued on condition that holders ‘shall have no rights of action against the company .... in respect of .... injury (fatal or otherwise) .... however caused.’ A jury found {{that the company had}} not taken reasonable steps to bring the conditions to the notice of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thompson</b> and awarded damages. But then the judge, as a matter of law, held that when the ticket was accepted the contract was complete, and so the jury was not entitled to find as they did. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thompson</b> could not read.|$|R

The boys, however, by no means did so; and as they were going to bed, Charley said: 'I think there is some chance of a row with the Indians, Hubert, for I noticed that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Thompson</b> looked grave when papa first said where he had bought the land. Depend upon it, we shall have some fun with them after all.'

60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson</b> {{would rather}} have got into the {{carriage}} at any other spot in Le Puy than at that at which {{she was forced to}} do so--the chief entrance, namely, of the Hotel des Ambassadeurs. And what made it worse was this, that an appearance of a special fate was given to the occasion. M. Lacordaire was dressed in more than his Sunday best. He had on new yellow kid gloves. His coat, if not new, was newer than any <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson</b> had yet observed, and was lined with silk up to the very collar. He had on patent leather boots, which glittered, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson</b> thought, much too conspicuously. And as for his hat, it was quite evident that it was fresh that morning from the maker's block.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson</b> {{felt that}} all this was silly and useless. If they {{were not to be}} dear friends this coming out feting together, those boots and gloves and new hat were all very foolish; and if they were, the sooner they {{understood}} each other the better. So <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson,</b> finding that the path was steep and the weather warm, stood still for a while leaning against the wall, with a look of considerable fatigue in her face.|$|R
60|$|M. Lacordaire, with {{conspicuous}} gallantry, first assisted <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thompson</b> {{from the}} carriage, and then handed down {{the two young}} ladies.

Those horrid boots and those horrid gloves gave him such an air of holiday finery that neither could he be at his ease wearing them, nor could she, in seeing them worn.|$|R
