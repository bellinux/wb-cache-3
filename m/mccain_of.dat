25|$|After Florida, {{the campaigns}} focused their {{attention}} on the 21 states voting on February 5, known as Super Tuesday. McCain {{was seen as the}} front-runner for the nomination heading in to this most important of primary dates. He had the lead in delegates to the national convention, and on January 30 he was officially endorsed by the withdrawing Giuliani. The candidates sparred at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on January 30, with former First Lady Nancy Reagan present in the front row.

25|$|Iowa was {{won by the}} Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, by a 9.54% {{margin of}} victory. Obama took 53.93% of the vote while his Republican opponent, Senator John <b>McCain</b> <b>of</b> Arizona, took 44.39%. Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush had very narrowly won Iowa in his re-election bid, although prior to that the state had gone Democratic for four elections straight. A Midwestern state where agriculture plays {{a critical role in}} the daily lives of its citizens, Iowa is nevertheless an independent state. However, due to Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses, Bush's unpopularity, and the troubling economy, the state easily fell into Obama's column later in the election season.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{attacked}} {{what he saw}} as {{pork barrel}} spending within Congress, believing that the practice did not contribute to the greater national interest. [...] Towards this end he was instrumental in pushing through approval of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president the power to veto individual expenditures. Although this was one of McCain's biggest Senate victories, the effect was short-lived as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional in 1998. [...] In a more symbolic attempt to limit congressional privilege, he introduced an amendment in 1994 to remove free VIP parking for members of Congress at D.C. area airports; his annoyed colleagues rejected the notion and accused <b>McCain</b> <b>of</b> grandstanding.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law.

Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst {{thing that ever happened to}} Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E

500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused <b>McCain</b> <b>of</b> having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit.
