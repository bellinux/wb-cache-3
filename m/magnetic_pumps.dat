40|$|The {{magnetohydrodynamics}} (MHD) model {{describes the}} flow of electrically conducting fluids {{in the presence of}} magnetic fields. A principal application of MHD is the modeling of plasma physics, ranging from plasma confinement for thermonuclear fusion to astrophysical plasma dynamics. MHD is also used to model {{the flow of}} liquid metals, for instance in <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumps,</b> liquid metal blankets in fusion reactor concepts, and aluminum electrolysis. The model consists of a non-self-adjoint, nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that couple the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow to a reduced set of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetics. In this dissertation, we consider computational issues arising for the MHD equations. We focus on developing fast computational algorithms for solving the algebraic systems that arise from finite element discretizations of the fully coupled MHD equations. Emphasis is on solvers for the linear systems arising from algorithms such as Newton's method or Picard iteration, with a main goal of developing preconditioners for use with iterative methods for the linearized systems. In particular, we first consider the linear systems arising from an exact penalty finite element formulation of the MHD equations. We then draw on this research to develop solvers for a formulation that includes a Lagrange multiplier within Maxwell's equations. We also consider a simplification of the MHD model: in the MHD kinematics model, the equations are reduced by assuming that the flow behavior of the system is known. In this simpler setting, we allow for epistemic uncertainty to be present. By mathematically modeling this uncertainty with random variables, we investigate its implications on the physical model...|$|E

Currently, the researches on <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump</b> have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump</b> with low flow and high head have been developed overseas.

Compressional <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit in the dayside magnetosphere is analyzed by means of computer simulations, wherein solar-wind compressions of the dayside magnetosphere energize electrons with electron pitch-angle scattering by chorus waves and by EMIC. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> is found to produce a weak bulk heating of the electron radiation belt, and it also produces an energetic tail on the electron energy distribution. The amount of energization depends on the robustness of the solar-wind compressions and on the amplitude of the chorus and/or EMIC waves. Chorus-catalyzed pumping is better at energizing medium-energy (50 - 200 keV) electrons than it is at energizing higher energy electrons; at high energies (500 keV - 2 MeV) EMIC-catalyzed pumping is a stronger energizer. The magnetic-pumping simulation results are compared with energy-diffusion calculations for chorus waves in the dayside magnetosphere; in general compressional <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> {{is found to be}} weaker at accelerating electrons than is chorus-driven energy diffusion.

40|$|We {{determine}} the nonlinear drift velocities {{of the mean}} magnetic field and nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in a turbulent convection. We show that the nonlinear drift velocities are caused by the three kinds of the inhomogeneities, i. e., inhomogeneous turbulence; the nonuniform fluid density and the nonuniform turbulent heat flux. The inhomogeneous turbulence results in the well-known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities. The nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field cause the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects in the turbulent convection. These phenomena {{are different from the}} large-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects which are due to the effect of the mean magnetic field on the large-scale density stratified fluid flow. The small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> can be stronger than these large-scale effects when the mean magnetic field is smaller than the equipartition field. We discuss the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects {{in the context of the}} solar and stellar turbulent convection. We demonstrate also that the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in the turbulent convection is anisotropic even for a weak mean magnetic field. In particular, it is enhanced in the radial direction. The magnetic fluctuations due to the small-scale dynamo increase the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the toroidal component of the mean magnetic field, while they do not affect the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the poloidal field.

40|$|Based on {{the rate}} of {{expansion}} of the solar wind, the plasma should cool rapidly {{as a function of}} distance to the Sun. Observations show this is not the case. In this work, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> model is developed as a possible explanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution functions observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area focus on the role that the dissipation of turbulent energy on microscopic kinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However, with <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent fluctuations, thus bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models, we include the pressure anisotropy term, providing a channel for the large scale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete set of coupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of the distribution function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form solution. Numerical simulations using the VPIC kinetic code are applied to verify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the model for realistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of particles are important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic perturbations and the pressure anisotropy. In turn, averaged over a pump cycle, the phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly to heat in the plasma. The results of this scenario show that <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> may account for {{a significant portion of the}} solar wind energization. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Coherent {{magnetic}} fields are often {{believed to be}} generated by the combination of stretching by differential rotation and turbulent amplification of magnetic field, via the so-called alpha effect. The latter is known to exist in helical turbulence, which is envisioned to arise due to both rotation and convection in solar-type stars. In this contribution, a turbulent flow driven by a nonhelical inhomogeneous forcing and its kinematic dynamo action are studied for a uniform magnetic field {{in the background of}} a linear shear flow. By using a quasilinear analysis and a nonperturbative method utilizing a time-dependent wave number, turbulence property and electromotive force are computed for arbitrary shear strength. Due to the large-scale shear flow, the turbulence is highly anisotropic, as a consequence, so is the electromotive force. The latter is found to exist even without rotation due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing, containing not only the alpha effect but also <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> (the gamma effect representing a transport of magnetic flux by turbulence). Specifically, without shear, only the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> exists, aligned with the direction of inhomogeneity. For a weak but nonzero shear, the combined effects of shear and inhomogeneous forcing modify the structure of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> when the inhomogeneity is in the plane of the shear flow, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> becoming bidimensional in that plane. It also induces an alpha tensor which has nondiagonal components. When the inhomogeneity is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow, the alpha effect has three nonzero diagonal components and one off-diagonal component. However, for a sufficiently strong shear, the gamma and alpha effects are suppressed due to shear stabilization which damps turbulence. A simplified dynamo model is then proposed where a large-scale dynamo arises due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing. In particular, the growth of a large-scale axisymmetric magnetic field is demonstrated in case of an inhomogeneity which is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow. Interesting implications of these results for the structure of {{magnetic fields}} in star with slow rotation are discussed. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 3551700...|$|R

40|$|The key {{elements}} of the Babcock-Leighton dynamos are the generation of poloidal field through decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar active regions and the generation of toroidal field through the observed differential rotation. These models are traditionally known as flux transport dynamo models as the equatorward propagations of the butterfly wings in these models are produced due to an equatorward flow {{at the bottom of}} the convection zone. Here we investigate the role of downward <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> near the surface using a kinematic Babcock-Leighton model. We find that the pumping causes the poloidal field to become predominately radial in the near-surface shear layer, which allows the negative radial shear to effectively act on the radial field to produce a toroidal field. We observe a clear equatorward migration of the toroidal field at low latitudes as a consequence of the dynamo wave even when there is no meridional flow in the deep convection zone. Both the dynamo wave and the flux transport type solutions are thus able to reproduce some of the observed features of the solar cycle, including the 11 -year periodicity. The main difference between the two types of solutions is the strength of the Babcock-Leighton source required to produce the dynamo action. A second consequence of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> is that it suppresses the diffusion of fields through the surface, which helps to allow an 11 -year cycle at (moderately) larger values of magnetic diffusivity than have previously been used.
