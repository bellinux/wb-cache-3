5|$|In Guatemala, a CIA-backed {{military}} coup ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954. The post-Arbenz government—a <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> headed by Carlos Castillo Armas—repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property {{belonging to the}} United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism {{at the request of}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made {{considerable}} efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the <b>military</b> <b>junta.</b> In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|The Pentagon Papers {{opined that}} Mecklin {{understood}} {{the pitfalls of}} a <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> that Krulak and Mendenhall had overlooked. Regardless, Mecklin concluded that the US should proceed in fostering a regime change, accept the consequences, and contemplate the introduction of US combat troops to stop a possible Viet Cong victory.|$|E

5|$|When the <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> came to power, the IAe 33 {{project was}} thrown into disarray. The new {{government}} released many of the leading air force staff; similarly, most of Tank's team {{was forced to leave}} Argentina with Tank himself going to India, where he worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and later developed the HF-24 Marut supersonic fighter.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted the <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> led by General Dương Văn Minh {{from the}} {{leadership}} of South Vietnam without firing a shot. It came {{less than three months}} after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on September 13, 1964, {{the ruling}} <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> of South Vietnam, led by General Nguyễn Khánh, was {{threatened}} by a coup attempt headed by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, who sent dissident units into the capital Saigon. They captured various key points and announced over national radio {{the overthrow of the}} incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Khánh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>military</b> <b>junta's</b> {{popularity}} {{continued to}} decline. By late June 2007, an ABAC Poll {{found that only}} 13.6% supported the government, with 69.8 of respondents disappointed with the political situation.|$|R

5|$|Following the coup, Nhung's {{commanding}} officer, General Minh, {{became the}} President of South Vietnam, ruling through a <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> {{known as the}} Military Revolutionary Council. After three months of rule, which was criticised for its lack of direction, General Nguyễn Khánh deposed Minh in a bloodless coup before dawn on 30 January 1964. Minh was briefly put under house arrest, and the next day, reports surfaced that Nhung was dead, the only fatality in the coup or its aftermath.|$|E
5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized {{control of the state}} itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and his colleagues in the Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E

5|$|However, the prisoners' time {{in prison}} was brief, as Diệm was deposed and killed in a coup in November 1963. On November 8, {{political}} opponents who had been imprisoned {{on the island of}} Poulo Condore were released by the <b>military</b> <b>junta.</b> Đán was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large crowd at the town hall. Suu later served as president for a brief period and Dan as a deputy prime minister. Thi, Đông and Lieu returned to South Vietnam and resumed their service in the ARVN.|$|E
5|$|Ponce Vaides {{was allowed}} {{to leave the country}} safely, as was Ubico himself. The <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> was {{replaced}} by another three-person junta consisting of Árbenz, Arana, and an upper-class youth named Jorge Toriello, who had {{played a significant role in}} the protests. Although Arana had come to the military conspiracy relatively late, his defection had brought the powerful Guardia de Honor (Honor Guard) over to the revolutionaries, and for this crucial role he was rewarded with a place on the junta. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly.|$|E
5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a <b>military</b> <b>junta,</b> he ended the ceasefire and continued on the offensive. The MR-26-7 put together a plan to oust the Cantillo-Piedra junta, freeing the high-ranking military officer Colonel Ramón Barquín from the Isle of Pines prison (where he had been held captive for plotting to overthrow Batista), and commanding him to fly to Havana to arrest Cantillo. Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the central}} {{government}} was initially praised (...) for its response to the quake (especially in comparison to Myanmar's ruling <b>military</b> <b>junta's</b> blockade of aid during Cyclone Nargis), it has seen an erosion in confidence over the school construction scandal.|$|R
50|$|Harsher {{methods were}} {{imposed on the}} Thai Chinese. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, a series of anticommunist Thai <b>military</b> <b>juntas,</b> {{starting}} with that of dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, sharply reduced Chinese immigration and prohibited all Chinese schools in Thailand.|$|R

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|Đông and Thi fled to Cambodia, while Diệm berated the United States for a {{perceived}} {{lack of support}} during the crisis. Afterwards, Diệm ordered a crackdown, imprisoning numerous anti-government critics and former cabinet ministers. Those that assisted Diệm were duly promoted, while those that did not were demoted. A trial for those implicated in the plot was held in 1963. Seven officers and two civilians were sentenced to death in absentia, while 14 officers and 34 civilians were jailed. Diệm's regime also accused the Americans of sending Central Intelligence Agency members to assist the failed plot. When Diệm was assassinated after a 1963 coup, those jailed after the 1960 revolt were released by the new <b>military</b> <b>junta.</b>|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5000|$|The Muslim Brotherhood's media {{office in}} London issued a {{statement}} that read the world [...] "cannot {{sit back and watch}} while innocent men, women and children are being indiscriminately slaughtered.

50|$|In August 2009, the United Wa State Army became {{involved}} in the Kokang incident, a violent conflict with Burma's <b>military</b> <b>junta's</b> Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw). This was the largest outbreak of fighting between ethnic armies and government troops since the signing of the cease-fire 20 years earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Later Soviet {{international}} societies emerged, they combined all the Soviet {{nations and}} people sympathetic with the Soviet regime. Such organizations were often called [...] "cultural-sports clubs". The work of such organizations was periodically cut short as before 1983 there were <b>military</b> <b>juntas</b> that ruled in Argentina intermittently.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, the celebration of the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the <b>military</b> <b>junta,</b> which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{was killed}} in a November 1963 coup, {{allowing}} Thi to return to South Vietnam and resume his military service. Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between Khánh and Đỗ Mậu, two generals disgruntled with their position under the <b>military</b> <b>junta</b> of Minh, who oversaw the overthrow of Diệm. Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diệm's director of military security, and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively unimportant position.|$|E
5000|$|Cang {{took over}} in November 1963 after Captain Hồ Tấn Quyền, a Diệm loyalist, was {{executed}} during the November 1963 coup that led to Diệm's ouster and execution.

50|$|A mixed {{history of}} elected presidents and puppet-master <b>military</b> <b>juntas</b> were {{the governments of}} Guatemala {{in the course of}} the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War (1960-96). However, in 1986, at the 26-year mark, the Guatemalan people promulgated a new {{political}} constitution, and elected Vinicio Cerezo (1986-91) president; then Jorge Serrano Elías (1991-93).|$|R
25|$|In 2007, {{hundreds}} of thousands of monks protested against the <b>military</b> <b>junta's</b> rule, and called for free elections, minority rights and the release of political prisoners in an event now known as the Saffron Revolution. The protest originally began in response to the government's removal of price subsidies for compressed natural gas.|$|R
