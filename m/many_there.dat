5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} <b>many</b> <b>there</b> were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since {{they were the only}} ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} for the episode.

After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how <b>many</b> <b>there</b> were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis moved {{forces to}} Camden from Charleston, and on August 16 inflicted an {{embarrassing}} defeat on Gates at the Battle of Camden. [...] The relatively untried Continentals in Gates' army were routed, and suffered heavy casualties. This served to keep South Carolina clear of Continental forces, {{and was a}} blow to rebel morale. The victory added to his reputation, although the rout of the American rebels had {{as much to do}} with the failings of Gates (whose rapid departure from the battlefield was widely noted) as it did the skill of Cornwallis. [...] In London, Cornwallis was perceived as a hero, and was viewed by <b>many</b> <b>there</b> as the right man to lead the British forces to victory over the rebels.|$|E

500|$|Once Fillmore {{was back}} home in Buffalo, he had no excuse to make speeches, and his {{campaign}} stagnated through {{the summer and fall}} of 1856. Political fixers who had been Whigs, such as Weed, tended to join the Republican Party, and the Know Nothings lacked experience at selling anything but nativism. [...] Accordingly, Fillmore's pro-Union stance mostly went unheard. [...] Although the South was friendly towards Fillmore, <b>many</b> <b>there</b> feared a Frémont victory would lead to secession, and some sympathetic to Fillmore moved into the Buchanan camp lest the anti-Frémont vote be split, which might elect the Republican. Scarry suggested that the events of 1856, including the conflict in Kansas Territory and the caning of Charles Sumner {{on the floor of the}} Senate polarized the nation, making Fillmore's moderate stance obsolete.|$|E
500|$|Behind {{the playful}} façade of Candide which has amused so <b>many,</b> <b>there</b> lies very harsh {{criticism}} of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for {{the execution of}} John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in Candide. For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, [...] " [...] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all…". Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is {{taking advantage of the}} local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how <b>many</b> <b>there</b> were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} genocide, officially no Armenians live in the area today. However, at least two groups of Armenian origin reside in the area. Hemshin peoples, a islamisized group with Armenian ethnic origin, live in the Black Sea coast, particularity in the Rize province. Another group, Crypto-Armenians or [...] "secret" [...] Armenians, live throughout Turkey, especially the eastern parts of the country. It is impossible to determine how <b>many</b> <b>there</b> are due to this(the fact they keep their identity hidden). estimates range from millions to the low 100,000s depending on the criteria used to determine it. since the Armenian Genocide, the area has been mostly inhabited by Kurds and Turks, with smaller numbers of Azerbaijanis (near the Turkish-Armenian border) and Georgians and Laz people in the northeastern provinces of Turkey.|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how <b>many</b> <b>there</b> are of me and Vinny".|$|E
