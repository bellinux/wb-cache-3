This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches {{in different parts of}} the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, <b>melon</b> <b>seeds</b> or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.' ...|$|E

The iron content of both seasoning salts (Maggi and A-one) was higher than that in the vegetables. Fermentation decreased the iron content of African locust bean while that of <b>melon</b> <b>seed</b> was unaffected. The availability of iron was generally high (21 - 35 %) while Maggi, iru and ogiri enhanced iron availability in Amaranthus composite diets but iron availability from Corchorus composite diets was inhibited. Tannin content in both vegetables was similar but phytate in Corchorus was 300 % greater than in Amaranthus. Fermentation reduced the level of magnesium by 50 % in locust bean but increased that of <b>melon</b> <b>seed.</b> The seasoning salts enhanced magnesium availability in Corchorus vegetable and was inhibited by locust bean and <b>melon</b> <b>seed.</b> Fermentation improved magnesium availability in condiment-Corchorus composite diets. Copper content was high in the plant foods, low but with high availability in the seasoning salts. Fermentation reduced the copper availability in locust bean but increased that of <b>melon</b> <b>seed.</b> Availability of copper was virtually inhibited in all the composite diets. Zinc content of iru and ogiri was 250 % greater than the level in seasoning salts and the vegetables.

40|$|Biodiesel’s {{acceptance}} as {{a substitute}} for fossil-derived diesel has grown the world over. However, the food-fuel debate over conventional vegetable oils has rekindled research interest in exploring lesser known and minor oil crops. In this work, egusi <b>melon</b> <b>seed</b> oil was studied {{for the first time as}} a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Crude egusi <b>melon</b> <b>seed</b> oil was transesterified using sodium methoxide as the catalyst at 60 °C and an oil/methanol ratio of 1 : 6 to produce its corresponding methyl esters. Egusi melon oil methyl ester (EMOME) yield was 82 %. Gas chromatographic analysis of EMOME showed that it was composed mainly of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic esters, which is similar to the profile of sunflower, soybean and safflower oil. All the measured fuel properties of EMOME satisfied both the ASTM D 6751 and the EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Fuel properties of EMOME were essentially identical with those of soybean, safflower and sunflower biodiesel. Remarkably, the kinematic viscosity of EMOME was measured to be 3. 83 mm 2 /s, a value lower than most biodiesel fuels reported in the literature.
