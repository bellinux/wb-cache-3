25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the singer}} was still seething {{about how the}} media had treated her unfairly {{over the last two}} years. When she started working with {{producer}} Dave Hall on the album, she wrote an answer song for the media. Titled [...] "Human Nature", it directly addressed the media and the press who had criticized her for dealing with taboo issues with her previous record and tried to punish her for that. [...] "I'm saying in the song that I'm giving <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> them. I'm not sorry", Madonna explained. Described by Billboard as [...] "Madonna taking on her critics more directly than ever with a logical, defiant attack on slut-shaming", the song was also about closing the book on the previous two years of her life. [...] "Human Nature" [...] eventually became the fourth and final single released from Bedtime Stories on June 6, 1995, by Maverick Records.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Pitti-Sing in The Mikado (1885–87), one of the [...] "three little maids from school." [...] Sometimes, {{inspiration}} for plot points in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was provided by characteristics of the performers themselves. [...] For instance, Gilbert noted {{in an interview that}} the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls—three [...] "little" [...] maids—and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible. [...] Bond, however, knew how to stand out on stage. [...] During preparations for The Mikado, she persuaded the wardrobe mistress to make the obi of her costume twice as big as that of the other [...] "little maids". [...] She wrote: [...] "I made the most of my big, big bow, turning <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the audience whenever I got a chance, and waggling it. [...] The gallery was delighted, but I nearly got the sack for that prank! [...] However, I did get noticed, which was what I wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{relationship}} {{continued to}} be frosty as Strachan moved into management himself. In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson stated that Strachan [...] "could not be trusted an inch – I {{would not want to}} expose <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him in a hurry". Strachan's reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, My Life in Football, was one of being [...] "surprised and disappointed", although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan's Coventry City in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County. By 2006 they appeared to have [...] "declared something of a truce", ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan's Celtic.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her second}} memoir, This 'N That (1987), Davis wrote, [...] "I am still {{recovering}} {{from the fact that}} a child of mine would write about me behind <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> <b>to</b> say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success." ...|$|E

Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie on my face {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I would have something to show my relatives, because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a {{seemingly}} needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to Nottingham Forest on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for [...] "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's Lewis McGugan was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not know he had received the first of the yellow cards. [...] "I didn't know I had been booked as I had <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the ref otherwise I would never have done that," [...] he said on his personal Twitter page. Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning him plaudits, with his then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing him with England number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart, and teammate and former England international Paul Konchesky describing him as [...] "one of the best [...] he has ever played with". [...] A short-distant reaction save against Portsmouth in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton as [...] "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time". and by Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as [...] "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".|$|E
