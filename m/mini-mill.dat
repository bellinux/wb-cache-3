25|$|Finally, {{the basic}} oxygen process was {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The {{basic oxygen process}} is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the <b>mini-mill</b> business, where scrap steel only is melted with an electric arc furnace. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reorganization}} of the US {{iron and steel industry}} provides a useful setting for an analysis of the relationship between industrial location and institutional forms. Regression analysis shows that institutional shifts in the organization of production dominated geographical shifts in employment and product value as integrated maxi-mills sought to raise productivity. The {{reorganization of}} production includes mill abandonment, increased subcontracting by maxi-mills in the initial stages of production, horizontal penetration by <b>mini-mills</b> in the sheet-steel market, and the growing integration of steel finishing and automobile assembly as firms that belong to Japanese corporate groups expand their operations in the USA. Maxi-mills are concentrating investment and production in the Midwest states as their joint ventures with Japanese steel firms specialize in the mass production of galvanized sheets for the automobile industry. Locational shifts also include the national spread of scrap-processing <b>mini-mills</b> and the rapid decline of raw-steel production in Pittsburgh as maxi-mills close furnaces and mills producing construction-grade bars and rods. ...|$|R

5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the long products market in 1969, they chose to start up a <b>mini-mill,</b> with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into <b>mini-mill</b> operations concentrated on local markets for long products, where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for long products, while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.|$|E

40|$|Scrap {{iron and}} steel has long been {{considered}} a resource in the steel-making industry, and its value is largely determined by its impurity content. As the <b>mini-mills,</b> the major consumers of scrap {{iron and steel}}, expand into producing flat-rolled sheet, the demand for high-quality scrap will increase. Of the impurities present in scrap, copper is particularly troublesome because of its role in causing hot shortness. Therefore, the copper content of scrap should be kept below {approx} 0. 1 wt%. A method for removing copper from steel {{could be used to}} improve the quality of scrap and make it more available for use by <b>mini-mills.</b> To determine the effectiveness of a binary slag consisting of aluminum sulfide and iron sulfide on the removal of copper from steel and iron, the distribution coefficient of copper between the slag and a carbon-saturated iron melt was investigated at 1, 365 C. The composition of the slag was varied from nearly pure aluminum sulfide to pure iron sulfide. A maximum distribution coefficient of 30 was found, and the copper level in the iron melt was reduced to as low as 0. 07 wt. % with a 4 : 1 ratio of iron to slag...|$|R

40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making steel {{strapping}} and strip from rod stock produced from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of <b>mini-mills</b> is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing steel strapping and cold-rolled strip steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, steel strapping and cold-rolled strip steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces steel strapping and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in <b>mini-mills.</b> The new process creates steel strapping and strip with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any steel strapping used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled strip steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|R

40|$|In this research, a {{large scale}} {{mathematical}} programming model is developed to represent steel production and distribution. This model is used to investigate how technological changes, environmental restrictions, and government trade policies will affect future production location and relocation, world energy consumption, environmental pollution, and international trade in steel. Future potential relocation of production capacity of the world {{iron and steel industry}} will have substantial impacts on the North American electric utility industry, especially in Indiana. Given that the iron and steel industry is among the most energy intensive industries in North America, the electricity consumption of Indiana in particular is expected to change significantly as the industry adjusts to the changing environment. ^ This research models the iron and steel industry in its use of two types of mills: integrated mills and <b>mini-mills.</b> Integrated mills use complex and capital intensive production processes to produce steel from iron ore, using a combination of the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace. <b>Mini-mills</b> use electric melters which convert mainly scrap or directly reduced iron to steel. The model can reflect the trade and energy consequences of a chosen pattern of steel production, as well as the constraints on the pollutant generation. It also reflects various government trade policies to protect domestic steel production, such as quotas and protective tariffs. In addition, the model minimizes the total cost of steel production and transportation by evaluating the geographic patterns of the following factors: (1) iron and steel production; (2) new facility construction; (3) trade patterns. ^ These factors are each subject to various constraints, such as demands, environmental restrictions, and government trade policies, imposed on the pattern of production. Optimization is performed for a single target year far enough in the future to allow construction of new capacity. The model also captures the transitional competition between the existing and the new capacities. Results indicate how future technological changes, environmental concerns and restrictions, and government trade policies can influence the iron and steel industry and the electric consumption of Indiana. ...|$|R
