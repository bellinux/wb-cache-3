40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2004 we {{recorded}} the seismicity at the Krafla geothermal field for forty days {{with an array of}} twenty PASSCAL L- 28 4. 5 -Hz sensors. The Krafla field is located approximately 60 km East of Akureyri in northern Iceland. The array covered an area approximately 5 km N-S by 4 km E-W. The field area is located on Holocene lava flows on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The array recorded approximately 5 micro-earthquakes per day at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. This high sampling rate is required to exploit newly developed theories on the frequency-dependence of shear-wave splitting (SWS). During the experiment, the injection well was stopped for ten days to study the response of the subsurface crack system to changes in water pressure. SWS is an exploration method based on the analyses of polarizations and time delays of shear waves that have been distorted by the anisotropy of the medium through which the seismic waves have propagated. Epicenters roughly align along the E-W direction, while hypocenters are shallow around the injection well and appear {{to be related to the}} on-going injection. Observations of SWS at Krafla have provided evidence for at least two major crack systems oriented approximately N-S and E-W. This last, rather unexpected direction is consistent with results from a simultaneous MT (<b>magneto-telluric)</b> <b>survey.</b> Further SWS study will lead to a more detailed understanding of the fracture locations, sizes, and orientations in the geothermal field...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{geophysical}} surveys using vertical electrical sounding (VES), {{very low}} frequency (VLF) EM, radiation counting, total magnetic field and self-potential (SP) measurements are carried out to characterize the geothermal area around a hot spring in the Nayagarh district, Orissa, India that lies in the East Indian geothermal province. The study was performed to delineate the fracture pattern, contaminated groundwater movement and possible heating source. VES interpretations suggest a three- to four-layer structure in the area. Resistivity survey near the hot spring suggests that weathered and fractured formations constitute the main aquifer system and extend to 60 m depth. Current flow measured at various electrode separations normalized by the applied voltage suggests that fractures extend to a greater depth. Detailed VLF study shows that fractures extend beyond 70 m depth. VLF anomaly has also very good correlation with the total magnetic field measured along the same profiles. Study results suggest that a gridded pattern of VLF survey could map the underground conductive fracture zones that can identify the movement of contaminated groundwater flow. Therefore, precautionary measures {{can be taken to}} check further contamination by delineating subsurface conducting structures. Self potential (SP) measured over the hot spring does not show a large anomaly in favor of the presence of a sulphide mineral body. A small positive (5 – 15 mV) SP anomaly is measured which may be streaming potential due to subsurface fluid flow. A high radiation is measured about four kilometers from the hot spring, suggesting possible radiogenic heating. However, the exact nature of the heating source and its depth is not known in the area. Deep resistivity followed by a <b>magneto-telluric</b> <b>survey</b> could reveal the deeper structures...|$|E
40|$|The Bouillante {{geothermal}} plant {{is the only}} installed capacity in the Caribbean volcanic islands, harnessing for almost 30 years a high enthalpy geothermal field located {{along the coast of}} western Guadeloupe. Exploration by BRGM and EURAFREP began in the 1960 s and four wells were drilled in the 1970 s. EDF and EURAFREP decided in the early 1980 s to build a first 4 MWe unit, Bouillante 1. Due to various difficulties in the operation of the plant, Geothermie Bouillante, a subsidiary of BRGM and EDF, was created in 1995 to take it over. Three new wells were drilled in 2001 and a new 11 MWe unit, Bouillante 2, started in 2005, in addition to the first unit. After four years of good operation that covered 6 to 7 % of the demand of the island, the plant had to face various technical and social issues. 2013 represents the full end of these events, with an availability of Bouillante 2 that exceeded 90 %. In a context of steady increase of the population and of energy demand in the Caribbean islands, the development of geothermal energy can provide base load and relatively cheap electricity. Due {{to the fact that the}} power generated by Geothermie Bouillante is purchased at a lower price than the one produced by oil-fuelled plants, it is estimated that the {{geothermal plant}} has enabled a saving of around € 60 M in the electricity bills paid by French customers over 9 years. The Bouillante geothermal field has also been the playing field for research, development and innovation of BRGM group, which developed tools to be applied in Bouillante but also in other overseas territories and abroad: one can mention, inter alia, the successful thermal stimulation of the BO- 4 well in 1998, the development of exploration methods in geology, fluid geochemistry and geophysics adapted to the overseas specificities, the exploration of other parts of the Bouillante area itself, the realization of several tracer tests and the modeling of the reservoir and of the wells. BRGM has recently been able to apply a part of this know-how in Martinique and Dominica islands. BRGM has thus continuously supported the development of the Bouillante field and its exploitation in a sustainable way. Geothermie Bouillante has enhanced the safety of its installations by reinforcing the well-heads and replacing the pipes on the well platform in 2010 so that they now resist to seism. It has reduced the noise generated by the plant through a full action plan that has been implemented in 2011 - 2013 and is now planning the reduction of H 2 S emissions. It has implemented a partial reinjection of the brine to maintain the pressure in the reservoir. In 2013 the Bouillante 1 unit was refurbished after a € 5 M investment : most major mechanical parts and the control systems were changed. It has also developed communication with the local community, inter alia through the setting up of a local committee (CLIC). Geothermie Bouillante has been granted in 2009 a concession which covers a large part of the territory of the Bouillante commune, and it develops additional projects in this area. Existing data suggest others areas of interest, notably in the northern part of the Bouillante bay. The company has therefore started preparation for the Bouillante 3 project, for which it has a license to drill exploration wells; it also considers launching a <b>magneto-telluric</b> <b>survey.</b> The stimulation of existing wells and additional brine reinjection are also being considered on the existing site, prior to the possible construction of an additional power generation capacity. Private or public, industrial and financial investors will be needed to help financing and developing these projects. In addition, as a stepping-stone for the development of geothermal energy in overseas territories and the Caribbean islands, BRGM and Geothermie Bouillante are also involved in several partnerships as the Geodenergies project of scientific institute, which aims at developing new underground technologies for decarbonated energies and will have an office in the French West Indies dedicated to geothermal power...|$|E
40|$|The Ngatamariki Geothermal Field {{is located}} 20 km north of Taupo in the Taupo Volcanic Zone {{and has a}} {{boundary}} of 12 km² as delineated by <b>magneto-telluric</b> <b>surveys</b> (Urzua 2008). Rhyolitic deposits, derived from the Maroa Volcanic Centre, dominate the geology of the area with the 186 AD (Wilson et al. 2009) Taupo pumice mantling stream valleys in the area. The majority of thermal features at Ngatamariki are located along the Orakonui Stream on the western boundary of the field; the stream area is dominated by a 50 x 30 m geothermal pool filling a hydrothermal eruption crater. This crater was formed during a hydrothermal eruption in 1948, with a subsequent eruption in April 2005. Orakei Korako is located 7 km north of Ngatamariki and {{has one of the}} largest collections of thermal features in New Zealand. The geology at Orakei Korako is similar to Ngatamariki, but the area is dominated by a series of south-west trending normal faults which create sinter terraces on the eastern bank of Lake Ohakuri. Water samples from springs and wells at Ngatamariki and Orakei Korako were taken to assess the nature of both fields. Spring waters at Ngatamariki have chloride contents of 56 to 647 mg/l with deep waters from wells ranging from 1183 to 1574 mg/l. This variation is caused by mixing of deep waters with a steam heated groundwater, above clay caps within the reservoir. Stable isotopic results (δ¹⁸O and δD) suggest that reservoir waters are meteoric waters mixed with magmatic (andesitic) water at Ngatamariki. Reservoir water chemistry at Orakei Korako exhibits low chloride contents, which is anomalous in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Chloride content in well and spring waters is similar ranging from 546 to 147 mg/l, due to mixing of reservoir fluids with a ‘hot water’ diluent at depth. Isotopic compositions of spring waters suggest that they are meteoric waters which mix with magmatic (rhyolitic) water, more enriched in δ¹⁸O and δD than ‘andesitic’ water. Relationships between major ion concentrations and known subsurface geology suggest there is no hydraulic connection between the two fields...|$|R
30|$|Magneto-tellurics (MT) is a geoelectrical {{sounding}} {{method used}} for estimating resistivity structure {{on the basis}} of electromagnetic induction (e.g., Cagniard, 1953; Vozoff, 1991; Simpson and Bahr, 2005). For the present study, AMT (Audio <b>Magneto-tellurics)</b> and MT <b>surveys</b> were conducted in November 2008, and July and August 2009 on the Unzen volcanic massif, using Phoenix Geophysics MTU- 5 system. The observation points, shown in Fig. 1, were configured in a N-S direction across the summit of Unzen volcano. Four Pb-PbCl 2 electrodes were used for measuring two orthogonal components of electric fields (N-S and E-W directions), and one additional electrode was used for grounding. Three orthogonal components of magnetic field (N-S, E-W, and vertical directions) were measured using three induction coils, which consist of a coil of copper wire wound on a core with high magnetic permeability. Data were collected in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 10 kHz. For the relatively high frequency range between 100 Hz and 10 kHz, AMT induction coils were used, and each observation point continued data acquisition for four hours. For the relatively low frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 Hz, MT induction coils were used, and each observation point continued data acquisition for one week. To remove contamination in the data due to local noise, we applied Gamble et al.’s (1979) remote reference processing method using geomagnetic data from Sawauchi (1000 km from Unzen). For the data obtained with the AMT induction coils, we performed mutual referencing within the survey area.|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of geothermal system at Mount Ciremai has been started {{since the early}} 1980 s and has just been studied carefully since the early 2000 s. Previous studies have detected the potential of geothermal system and also the groundwater mechanism feeding the system. This paper will discuss the geothermal exploration based on regional scale surface temperature analysis with Landsat image {{to have a more}} detail interpretation of the geological setting and <b>magneto-telluric</b> or MT <b>survey</b> at prospect zones, which identified by the previous method, to have a more exact and in depth local scale structural interpretation. Both methods are directed to pin point appropriate locations for geothermal pilot hole drilling and testing. We used four scenes of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper or ETM+ data to estimate the surface manifestation of a geothermal system. Temporal analysis of Land Surface Temperature or LST was applied and coupled with field temperature measurement at seven locations. By combining the TTM with NDVI threshold, the authors can identify six zones with surface temperature anomaly. Among these six zones, three zones were interpreted to have a relation with geothermal system and the other three zones were related to human activities. Then, MT survey was performed at the three geothermal prospects identified from previous remote sensing analysis, at the east flank of the volcano, to estimate the detail subsurface structures. The MT survey successfully identified four buried normal faults in the area, which positively {{are a part of the}} conduits in the geothermal system east of Mount Ciremai. From MT analysis, the author also found the locations of volcanic zone, bedrock zone, and the prospect zone. The combination of Landsat analysis on regional scale and MT measurement on a more detail scale has proven to be the reliable method to map geothermal prospect area.
