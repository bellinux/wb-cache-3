40|$|Treatment {{research}} in the adolescent substance abuse specialty has evolved rapidly in the past decade. Family therapies are emerging as “best practice ” treatments for adolescent substance abuse (Ozechowski & Liddle, 2000). ␣ This ␣ paper presents an overview of <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Therapy</b> (MDFT), an outpatient, empirically supported, family-based approach {{to the treatment of}} adolescent substance abuse and associated mental health and behavioural problems (Liddle, 2002 a). ␣ MDFT integrates the clinical and theoretical traditions of developmental psychology and psychopathology, the ecological perspective, and family therapy. This family-focused, developmentally-based substance abuse treatment for adolescents works to facilitate change at different system levels, in different domains of functioning, and with different people inside and outside of the family, to end drug use and related problems, thus returning the youth and family to a normative developmental trajectory. The MDFT approach has been recognised {{as one of the most}} promising interventions for adolescent drug abuse and related problem behaviours in a new generation of evidence-based, multicomponent, and theory-derived treatments.

How-ever, existing interventions aimed at reducing adolescent HIV risk behavior have rarely targeted these vulnerable young adolescents, and many approaces focus on individual-level change without attention to family or contextual influences.

40|$|This is a {{protocol}} for an ongoing review. It contains useful definitions and information. <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Therapy</b> (MDFT) {{has evolved over}} {{the last twenty years}} and is a manual-based, family-oriented treatment, designed to eliminate drug use and associated problems in young people (Liddle, 1999; Liddle, 2002; Liddle et al., 2009). MDFT is one of many Family Therapy forms that meet the general characteristics of manual-based Family Therapies as it deals with young people and their families as a system throughout treatment, and thereby recognizes the important role of the family system in the development and treatment of young people’s drug use problems. This review will specifically explore the family-based intervention <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Therapy</b> (MDFT) as aggregated evidence for MDFT’s effects is needed. The review seeks to clarify the effects of the MDFT program for relevant groups of young people age 11 - 21 living with their family. The review focus is on young people enrolled in treatment for drug use, independent of how their problem is labeled. Enrolment in treatment indicates that the severity of the young person’s drug use has caused a significant adult close to the young person (teacher, parent, social services worker, school counselor, etc.), or the young person themself to seek treatment. The intervention in focus is MDFT delivered as outpatient treatment and the review will focus primarily on non-opioid drugs use, but will consider poly-drug use if relevant. This review will be one in a series of reviews on different manual-based family therapy interventions for young people in treatment for drug use...|$|E
40|$|The {{family can}} {{play a vital role}} in {{addressing}} the issue of substance use disorders among adolescents. This is according to the latest edition in the ‘EMCDDA papers’ series — <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>family</b> <b>therapy</b> for adolescent drug users: a systematic review — released today. Adolescence is a period in human development during which individuals are more prone to risk-taking and less prone to impulse control. Some young people experiment with both licit and illicit substances during this time (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other drugs) and this can have an impact on their behaviour, their relationships with others and their functioning in society. The new report focuses on <b>multidimensional</b> <b>family</b> <b>therapy</b> (MDFT), a form of inclusive therapy involving the young person, their family and their environment. Based on five studies carried out in the United States and the EU, the paper shows how this holistic approach can deliver promising results that are visible both during, and after, therapy. Further studies may be needed, however, to confirm the preliminary positive results presented in this paper. One issue highlighted is that MDFT requires family engagement which cannot always be obtained. The approach may also come at a higher cost than other therapeutic options due to its high-intensity delivery, highlighting the need for accurate cost–benefit analyses. MDFT is currently implemented in several European countries, including Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. These countries are involved in a collaborative evaluation study — the International Cannabis Need of Treatment Project (INCANT) — which includes a randomised controlled trial of MDFT, funded under Europe’s Action Plan for Cannabis Research...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Therapy</b> (MDFT) {{has been}} empirically {{supported}} {{in a series}} of randomized clinical trials over 20 years. These studies have demonstrated the potency of MDFT in achieving outcomes across functional areas of the teen’s life, including reductions in alcohol-other drug use, behavioral problems, emotional symptoms, negative peer associations, school failure, and deficits within the family. This article describes our approach to refining and testing MDFT with teens who abuse alcohol. Drawing from the research base on risk and protective factors for teen alcohol abuse and relapse patterns, a strong case can be made for using a family-based approach for adolescent alcohol problems. MDFT shows promising preliminary results with teens who have alcohol and marijuana use disorders. Specific change targets withi...|$|E

Four follow-ups were conducted three, six, nine and twelve months after study baseline. 120 adolescents between 13 and 18 years with cannabis abuse or dependence (DSM-IV) participated. Results: Compared to the baseline, participants of both treatments significantly reduced their cannabis use, use-related problems and psychological disorders in the twelve-month follow-up. MDFT was significantly more effective than JUP in the reduction of cannabis use (d = 0. 31).

Method: A substantive review of each intervention is conducted using guidelines for effective treatment for substance use problems.

Results: Treatment components of five interventions—Brief Strategic Family Ther-apy (BSFT), Family Behavior Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Therapy</b> (MDFT), and Multisystemic Treatment—were consistent with a majority of guidelines for effective treatment. Notable exceptions include no aftercare and poor treatment retention. MDFT and BSFT met criteria of probably efficacious treatment, whereas the other interventions represented promising treatments. Moreover, MDFT demonstrated clinically signifi-cant changes in substance use and large effect sizes at posttreatment and follow-up.
