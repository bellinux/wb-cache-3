25|$|The XPS Print Path {{introduced}} in Windows Vista supports high quality 16-bit color printing. The XPS print path uses XML Paper Specification (XPS) as the print spooler file format, {{that serves as}} the page description language (PDL) for printers. The XPS spooler format is the intended replacement for the Enhanced <b>Metafile</b> (EMF) format which is the print spooler format in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print path. XPS is an XML-based (more specifically XAML-based) color-managed device and resolution independent vector-based paged document format which encapsulates an exact representation of the actual printed output. XPS documents are packed in a ZIP container along with text, fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics and DRM information. For printers supporting XPS, this eliminates an intermediate conversion to a printer-specific language, increasing the reliability and fidelity of the printed output. Microsoft claims that major printer vendors are planning to release printers with built-in XPS support and that this will provide better fidelity to the original document.|$|E

The imaging model of the Quartz graphics layer is based on the model common to Display PostScript and PDF, leading to the nickname Display PDF. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the Safari web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a PNG file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.|$|E

Among the multimedia such as text, image, audio and video, video is a dominant component {{in terms of}} the performance of proxy server due to its traffic characteristics. For the fast caching process, caching sequences for videos are obtained to decrease both the buffer size and the required bandwidth and saved into <b>metafiles</b> in advance. Then, we present a novel caching and replacing algorithms for multimedia objects based on the <b>metafiles.</b> Finally, experimental results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

50|$|The Windows <b>Metafile</b> vulnerability—also {{called the}} <b>Metafile</b> Image Code Execution and {{abbreviated}} MICE—is a security vulnerability {{in the way}} some versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system handled images in the Windows <b>Metafile</b> format. It permits arbitrary code to be executed on affected computers without the permission of their users. It was discovered on December 27, 2005, and the first reports of affected computers were announced within 24 hours. Microsoft released a high-priority update to eliminate this vulnerability via Windows Update on January 5, 2006. Attacks using this vulnerability are known as WMF exploits.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{protocol}} itself is perfectly legal, problems stem from using {{the protocol}} to traffick copyright infringing works. There has been much controversy {{over the use of}} BitTorrent trackers. BitTorrent <b>metafiles</b> themselves do not store file contents. Whether the publishers of BitTorrent <b>metafiles</b> violate copyrights by linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders is controversial. Various jurisdictions have pursued legal action against websites that host BitTorrent trackers. High-profile examples include the closing of Suprnova.org, TorrentSpy, LokiTorrent, BTJunkie, Mininova, Demonoid and Oink's Pink Palace. The Pirate Bay torrent website, formed by a Swedish group, is noted for the [...] "legal" [...] section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed. On 31 May 2006, The Pirate Bay's servers in Sweden were raided by Swedish police on allegations by the MPAA of copyright infringement; however, the tracker was up and running again three days later. In the study used to value NBC Universal in its merger with Comcast, Envisional examined the 10,000 torrent swarms managed by PublicBT which had the most active downloaders. After excluding pornographic and unidentifiable content, it was found that only one swarm offered legitimate content.|$|R

50|$|The WMF format was {{designed}} to be executed by the Windows GDI layer in order to restore the image, but as the WMF binary files contain the definition of the GDI graphic primitives that constitute this image, it is possible to design alternative libraries that render WMF binary files, like the Kyktir application does, or convert them into other graphic formats. For example, the Batik library is able to render WMF files and convert them to their Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) equivalent. The Vector Graphics package of the FreeHEP Java library allows the saving of Java2D drawings as Enhanced <b>Metafiles</b> (EMF). Inkscape and XnView can export to WMF or EMF.|$|R

Lua presents a mechanism of fallbacks that allows programmers to extend the semantics of the language in some unconventional ways. As a noteworthy example, fallbacks allow the user to add different kinds of inheritance to the language.
