Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment." [...] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.” At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.|$|R

40|$|State {{licensing}} requirements for <b>money</b> <b>transmission</b> businesses involved in international remittances have allowed key players Western Union and MoneyGram {{to benefit from}} the high demand for remittances and the lack of competition by enabling these entities to impose inflated prices on migrant consumers. With the growth of remittance flows and the rise of technological innovations, such as Internet and mobile payments, the current state-by-state {{licensing requirements}} for <b>money</b> <b>transmission</b> businesses prove to be overly burdensome and expensive and, ultimately, a barrier to entry for small businesses and start-ups. This note proposes to replace the current money-transmitting state licensing framework with a single, federal licensing requirement in order to increase market competition and provide more reasonable prices to consumers. Federal licensing would alleviate the burden of varying state licensing requirements while still allocating to the states control of <b>money</b> <b>transmission</b> businesses through oversight of compliance with state consumer protection regulations...|$|R

40|$|Network based {{services}} are expanding scale at an unprecedented speed currently. With the continuously strengthen of user’s dependence on these, performance issues {{are becoming more}} and more important. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a negotiated contract between service provider and customer in the way of service quality, priority, responsibility, etc. In this thesis, we designed and implemented a prototype for a SLA driven <b>transmission</b> <b>service,</b> which can deliver a file from one host to another, using a combination of different transport protocols. The proposed service measures the network conditions, and based on these and user’s requirement, it dynamically evaluates if it can meet the user SLA. Once a transmission has been accepted, it uses this information to adjust the usage of different transfer layer protocols, in order to meet the agreed SLA. The thesis work is based on the investigating of network theory and experimental results. We research how the SLA driven <b>transmission</b> <b>service</b> is affected by various factors, they include user’s requirements, network conditions, and service performance, etc. We design and implement an evaluation model for the network performance. It reveals how network performance is influenced by different network metrics, such as Round-Trip-Time (RTT), Throughput, and Packet Loss Rate (PLR), etc. We implement a <b>transmission</b> <b>service</b> on real test-bed, which is a controllable environment. We can alter the network metrics and measuring frequency of our evaluation model. Then, we evaluate these changes with our evaluation model and improve the performance of the <b>transmission</b> <b>service.</b> After that, we propose a calculating method for the service cost. At last, we can summarize the feasibility of this SLA driven <b>transmission</b> <b>service.</b> In the experiments, we obtain the variable delivery time and packet loss of the <b>transmission</b> <b>service,</b> which are changed with RTT and PLR of network. We analyze the different performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>service,</b> which uses TCP, UDP, and SCTP separately. Also a suitable measuring frequency and the cost for the usage of <b>transmission</b> <b>service</b> on this frequency are pointed out. Statistical analysis on the experiment results show that such SLA driven <b>transmission</b> <b>service</b> is feasible. It brings improved performance for user’s requirements. In addition, we come up with some useful suggestions and future work for the <b>transmission</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{deregulated}} environment, {{the transmission}} network {{is considered to}} be the key factor of the electricity markets. One of the important issues in this context is how to charge the users for the use of transmission facilities in the fair way {{and at the same time}} allowing the transmission utilities to recover their transmission costs. Several methodologies have been developed to recover the cost of <b>transmission</b> <b>services</b> and to estimate the power contributed by single generating unit in lines and loads. Both developed methods attempt to allocate the charge of the use of the transmission system. This paper describes certain aspects to be considered in pricing the unbundled <b>transmission</b> <b>services.</b> These aspects cover the type of <b>transmission</b> <b>services,</b> the costs related to the services and the methods used to calculate the costs of <b>transmission</b> <b>services.</b> This paper also proposes a new approach to allocate the costs of the <b>transmission</b> <b>services</b> among the <b>transmission</b> user utilising the properties of MW-mile based method.
