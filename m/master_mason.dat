One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking {{under the weight of the}} crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E

5|$|From 1643 to 1659, {{he served}} as <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> for the {{construction}} of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt {{one or two of the}} towers in 1648. Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.|$|E
5|$|Speirs {{was also}} a freemason. He was {{initiated}} into The Lodge Saint Vincent Sandyford No 553, based in Glasgow, on 11 March 1908, just four days after {{he had made his}} only Scottish appearance. When his football career took him away from Glasgow, Speirs maintained links with the lodge. He became a <b>Master</b> <b>Mason,</b> then a life member on 12 February 1913.|$|E
5|$|Following the Restoration of Charles II, Mylne was {{reconfirmed}} in {{his post}} of Royal <b>Master</b> <b>Mason,</b> and was commissioned in 1663 {{to survey the}} upper floors of Holyrood Palace.

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|King James VI visited Doune on occasion, and in 1581 {{authorised}} £300 to {{be spent}} on repairs and improvements, the works being carried out by the <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> Michael Ewing under the supervision of Robert Drummond of Carnock, Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland. In 1593, a plot against James was discovered, and the King surprised the conspirators, who included the Earls of Montrose and Gowrie, at Doune Castle.|$|E
5|$|Mylne {{learned his}} trade from his father, {{assisting}} him with projects including the sundial at Holyrood Palace. In 1633 Mylne {{was made a}} burgess of the royal burgh of Edinburgh, and {{was admitted to the}} Edinburgh lodge of masons, both due to his father's position. He was first appointed to the town council in 1636 and, in the same year, was appointed <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> to the Crown, succeeding his father.|$|E

5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and <b>Master</b> <b>Mason.</b> These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Mylne was {{in discussions}} with the town of Perth for {{construction}} of a new market cross. However, he died at Edinburgh in December. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, where a monument, erected by his nephew and apprentice Robert Mylne, still stands. Another memorial was erected by the Freemasons at their meeting place, St. Mary's Chapel, although this former church was demolished in the 18th century. His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Mylne succeeded him as <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> to the crown.|$|E

5|$|James Smith (c. 1645–1731) {{worked as}} a mason on Bruce's {{rebuilding}} of Holyrood Palace. In 1683 he was appointed Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works, responsible for the palace's maintenance. With his father-in-law, the <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> Robert Mylne (1633–1710), Smith worked on Caroline Park in Edinburgh (1685), and Drumlanrig Castle (1680s). Smith's country houses followed the pattern established by William Bruce, with hipped roofs and pedimented fronts, in a plain but handsome Palladian style. Hamilton Palace (1695) was fronted by giant Corinthian columns, and a pedimented entrance, but was otherwise restrained. Dalkeith Palace (1702–10) was modelled after William of Orange's palace at Het Loo in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} programme, {{begun by}} Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin in the 12th century, continued under Jocelin of Wells, {{who was a}} canon from 1200, then bishop from 1206. Adam Locke was <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> from about 1192 until 1230. It was designed in the new style with pointed arches, later known as Gothic, which was introduced {{at about the same}} time at Canterbury Cathedral. Work was halted between 1209 and 1213 when King John was excommunicated and Bishop Jocelin was in exile, but the main parts of the church were complete by the time of the dedication by Bishop Jocelin in 1239.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E

5|$|Walmer {{was built}} between April 1539 and autumn 1540, {{by a team}} {{including}} Richard Benese as the surveyor, William Clement as the master carpenter, and Christopher Dickenson as the <b>master</b> <b>mason.</b> It was initially garrisoned by a captain, two lieutenants, two porters, ten gunners and three soldiers, at an annual cost of £174. It was probably equipped {{with a range of}} brass and cast-iron guns, along with arquebuses and bows for close defence. In 1597, a report listed the castle's artillery as comprising a cannon, a culverin, five demi-culverins, a saker, a minion and a falcon.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the districts}} include Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are {{included}} in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic architecture church towers. The prolific construction of the towers—some started before 1360—was typically accomplished by a <b>master</b> <b>mason</b> and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals—their most important commissions. Contract builders carried out the plans, adding a distinctive mix of innovative details and decorations as new designs emerged over the years. These are included in the List of towers in Somerset.|$|E
