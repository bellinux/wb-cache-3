5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, {{and within a few}} weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E

25|$|In English law, {{high treason}} was {{punishable}} by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt {{at the stake}} (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most modern jurists would call it excessive. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> now just be considered dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Close to Home is a New Zealand {{television}} {{soap opera}} that ran on Television One (Formally NZBC, later becoming Television New Zealand) from 1975 to 1983. At {{its peak in}} 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make The Governor). Gloss is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap Dynasty, with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was {{a starting point for}} many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> go on to star in Shortland Street, which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992.

25|$|The {{first floor}} {{is where the}} Great Hall with its large vaulted ceiling is situated. The Great Hall was mainly used for grand banquets and {{entertainment}} for the lord and his guests. Guests staying at the castle would have also slept {{on the floor of}} the Great Hall. The Hall also served as a court as the lord would act as a judge passing verdicts and sentences for crimes committed in the surrounding area. The first floor also has a minstrel's gallery where a group of travelling minstrels would play instruments and act for the Lord and Lady sitting below. Off the minstrel's gallery is the minstrels changing room, where the travelling players would change into their bright costumes. This room would also have been used by the minstrels to sleep in; the reason for them having their own private quarters was that it was feared that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have been carrying disease. They slept here to stop them passing any ailments on to other guests. The guard room also sits on the first floor. The guard room has the only access to the dungeon in the castle, a small hole in the floor where prisoners were thrown in. A guard would always be present in this room to both guard the dungeon but also the only entrance to the castle, a small door above ground level, which is next to the guard room.|$|E

500|$|When {{the scandal}} forced Brownlee's {{resignation}} as premier, Lymburn stayed on as attorney-general in the short-lived government of Richard Gavin Reid. [...] The conservative Reid government was suffering damage to its popularity {{as a result}} of the Great Depression, and radical economic theories, most notably the version of social credit espoused by Calgary evangelist William Aberhart, were gaining currency among the public. [...] The government's position was that Aberhart's proposals were beyond the legal authority of the provincial government, since they involved banking, which the Constitution of Canada makes a responsibility of the federal government. [...] As attorney-general, Lymburn played a major role in defending this position. [...] When the government brought social credit founder C. H. Douglas from the United Kingdom as an advisor, Lymburn provided him with a copy of one of Aberhart's speeches and asked him to critique it; Douglas concluded that Aberhart's proposals did not align with [...] "Douglasite" [...] social credit, and that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> not have the desired effect.|$|E
500|$|Offa was {{a generous}} {{patron of the}} church, {{founding}} several churches and monasteries, often dedicated to St Peter. Among these was St Albans Abbey, which he probably founded in the early 790s. He also promised a yearly gift of 365 mancuses to Rome; a mancus was a term of account equivalent to thirty silver pennies, derived from Abbasid gold coins that were circulating in Francia at the time. Control of religious houses was {{one way in which}} a ruler of the day could provide for his family, and to this end Offa ensured (by acquiring papal privileges) that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> remain the property of his wife or children after his death. This policy of treating religious houses as worldly possessions represents a change from the early 8th century, when many charters showed the foundation and endowment of small minsters, rather than the assignment of those lands to laypeople. In the 770s, an abbess named Æthelburh (who may have been the same person as Offa's daughter of that name) held multiple leases on religious houses in the territory of the Hwicce; her acquisitions have been described as looking [...] "like a speculator assembling a portfolio". Æthelburh's possession of these lands foreshadows Cynethryth's control of religious lands, and the pattern was continued in the early 9th century by Cwoenthryth, the daughter of King Coenwulf.|$|E
500|$|Given Oklahoma's {{plans to}} build a turnpike north from Oklahoma City to the Kansas state line, and taking into account traffic flow maps {{prepared}} by the highway department, a preliminary route was chosen connecting the proposed Oklahoma turnpike to Kansas City via Wichita and Topeka. A second route extending from Topeka to Salina, and further west to the Colorado state line (the modern-day I-70 corridor) was also studied. Over 173,000 drivers were surveyed to determine how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be willing to use the two proposed routes in order to establish their profitability. While the western Kansas route was determined not to be feasible, the Oklahoma–Kansas City route was projected to generate a total revenue of $9 million in 1957 (about $ in [...] dollars). After considering a number of different alignments, including one bypassing Topeka via the present route of I-35, the state decided on an [...] "airline" [...] route between Wichita and Topeka. From Wichita south, the turnpike was to parallel U.S. Route 81, continuing into Oklahoma; the interchange with U.S. Route 166 at South Haven was included to provide an outlet if Oklahoma lagged in its construction. The turnpike was to parallel U.S. Route 40 from Topeka to Kansas City. The Kansas City end was set at 18th Street and Muncie Boulevard, which was to be extended and upgraded to a freeway (the Muncie Expressway) to the Intercity Viaduct by the state.|$|E
