40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> on fatigue life was investigated for Type 316 stainless steel {{at room temperature}} in ambient environment. Two types of <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> were simulated in the fatigue tests: constant and increasing (ratcheting) mean strains. In order to apply the constant <b>mean</b> <b>strain,</b> prestraining was induced prior to fatigue tests. Although the stress amplitudes became larger due to the prestraining, fatigue lives were almost {{the same as those}} obtained using non-prestrained specimens for the same strain range. Change in the maximum peak stress and stress amplitude due to the prestraining had little influence on the fatigue life. It was shown that the <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> showed little influence on the fatigue life under the same strain range. The ratcheting <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> was observed during the fatigue tests under mean stress. The fatigue life was reduced by applying the mean stress for the same strain range. The degree of the reduction was increased with the magnitude of the ratcheting <b>mean</b> <b>strain.</b> It was deduced that the increasing <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> enhanced the crack mouth opening and increased the effective strain range. It was concluded that the ratcheting <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> reduced the fatigue life for the same strain range, and the reduction in fatigue life could be predicted conservatively by assuming the crack mouth was never closed during the fatigue tests...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally investigate the bond-related tension stiffening behavior of flexural reinforced concrete (RC) beams made with lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) under various high-cycle fatigue loading conditions. Based on strain measurements of tensile steel in the RC beams, fatigue-induced degradation of tension stiffening effects was evaluated and was, compared to reinforced normal weight concrete (NWC) beams with equal concrete compressive strengths (40 MPa). According to applied load-mean steel <b>strain</b> relationships, the <b>mean</b> steel <b>strain</b> that developed under loading cycles was divided into elastic and plastic strain components. The experimental results showed that, in the high-cycle fatigue regime, the tension stiffening behavior of LWAC beams was different from that of NWC beams; LWAC beams had a lesser reduction in tension stiffening due to a better bond between steel and concrete. This was reflected in the stability of the elastic <b>mean</b> steel <b>strains</b> and in the higher degree of local plasticity that developed at the primary flexural cracks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompressive {{residual}} stresses are often induced by mechanical surface treatment such as shot peening {{for the purpose}} of improving fatigue life of components. Cyclic relaxation of the induced compressive residual stress, however, reduces the benefit. For component design and life management purposes {{it is important to be}} able to assess the effect of {{residual stresses}} and their relaxation on fatigue life. The problem, however, is that the phenomenon of residual stress relaxation under cyclic mechanical loads is not well understood. Furthermore, there is the technical challenge of accurately quantifying residual stress relaxation during component operation. The difficulties in measuring residual stress relaxation in real-time impede the consideration of tracking and assessing its effect on remaining fatigue life. In this paper a previously proposed cyclic hardening/softening model is adapted and modified to account for residual stress relaxation. Considering residual stress as virtual mean stress the cyclic stress-strain response during residual stress relaxation is described and simulated using the Matlab/Simulink Program. The virtual mean stress has a corresponding <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> which conditions result in biased stress/strain limits under cyclic load. It is shown that residual stress relaxation is associated with mean stress shift in stress-axis direction and <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> shift in the strain axis direction. The significance of this <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> shift is briefly discussed in terms of tracking and quantitatively determining residual stress relaxation in real-time...|$|E

However, the equilibrium algebraic stress closure with the Rotta return-to-isotropy model (1951) for the pressure-strain terms gives as good a correlation with measurements as when the Launder et al. <b>mean</b> <b>strain</b> model is included in the pressure-strain model. Finally, comparison of the calculations with the standard k-epsilon closure results show that the algebraic stress closures are better suited for simple turbulent flow calculations...|$|E

40|$|Fully {{developed}} two-dimensional channel-flow turbulence is {{subjected to}} <b>mean</b> <b>strains</b> that imitate those produced by pressure gradients in three-dimensional boundary layers. This is achieved by applying irrotational temporal deformations to the flow domain in a conventional channel direct-numerical-simulation (DNS) code; straining deformations at an angle {{with respect to the}} initial flow direction generate a mean cross flow and thus mean three-dimensionality. The velocity difference carried by the near-wall region is further controlled by mean pressure gradients (or by accelerating the walls in-plane), thus introducing another effect of pressure gradients in boundary layers. “Numerical experiments” allow the effects of the inviscid skewing mechanism, adverse pressure gradient, and inner layer to be isolated; our primary interest here is in the outer layer. We present five simulations. In-plane skewing decreases both the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy, whereas strains characteristic of two-dimensional adverse pressure gradients increase them. In all cases, the structure parameter a 1, the ratio of shear stress to energy, is diminished, which implies a reduction in the efficiency of the kinetic energy production by the mean shear. <br/...|$|R
