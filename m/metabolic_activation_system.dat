Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are believed to}} be among the causative agents for lung cancer in smokers. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypic carcinogenic PAH, which requires <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> to elicit its detrimental effects. The major end product of its diol epoxide <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> pathway is r- 7,t- 8, 9,c- 10 -tetrahydroxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (trans, anti-BaPT). Individual differences in exposure to, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of, carcinogenic PAH may influence cancer risk. Measurement of PAH metabolites in human urine could provide a direct way to assess individual differences in susceptibility to PAH-related cancer. We developed a sensitive and reliable method for quantitation of trans, anti-BaPT in human urine using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS/MS). A unique phenotyping strategy using [D 10]PheT as probes have been developed, allowing direct assessment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of carcinogenic PAH in humans. We investigated [D 10]phenanthrene metabolism in smokers after administration by inhalation in cigarette smoke or orally. Sixteen smokers received 10 µg [D 10]phenanthrene in a cigarette or orally. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for [D 10]r- 1,t- 2, 3,c- 4 -tetrahydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydrophenanthrene ([D 10]PheT), the major end product of the diol epoxide pathway, by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The ratios of [D 10]PheT (oral dosing: inhalation) in 15 smokers were 1. 03 ± 0. 32 and 1. 02 ± 0. 35, based on plasma AUC 0 -&# 8734; and total 48 hr urinary excretion, respectively. Overall {{there was no significant difference}} in the extent of [D 10]PheT formation after the two different routes of exposure in smokers. Its application in clinical studies has approved, for the first time, that there is large inter-individual variation in PAH <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> in smokers. One striking finding is that the formation of PAH diol epoxides, the ultimate carcinogen, occurs astonishingly rapidly in smokers, particularly after inhalation of cigarette smoke. The pharmacokinetics parameters of PAH metabolites in humans have also been presented.

Methanol extracts also showed positive results at 1. 25 mg/ml and 2. 5 mg/ml with IR = 1. 70 ± 0. 33 and IR = 2. 12 ± 0. 51 respectively, and aqueous extract at 0. 625 mg/ml with IR = 1. 54 ± 0. 48 and 5 mg/ml with IR = 1. 74 ± 0. 50. There was a significant difference of the mean values of IR between the four different types of “belacan ” extracts from Batang Tiga (p < 0. 05). All four “belacan ” extracts from Pantai Puteri, Me-laka did not show any mutagenic effect. With the presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> <b>system,</b> there was no mutagenic ef-fect observed in all four extracts from the three districts.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic activity of a number of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, which are widely used as chemical intermediates, solvents, degreasing agents etc. in industry, and to establish the structure-toxicity relationship of the chemicals by using the most adequate determinants in estimating their toxicity. The mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of some of the candidate chemicals, namely 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane, 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane and 1, 1, 3 -trichloropropene were evaluated in an in vitro micronucleus assay. The cytokinesis-block methodology was applied on human lymphocytes in the presence or absence of an external <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> <b>system</b> (S 9 -mix). In the micronucleus assay, all test substances, except 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane with and without S 9 -mix and 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane without S 9 -mix in the repeated experiment, exhibited a low but statistically significant mutagenic activity, compared to the concurrent control. However, none of the five chemicals was able to induce a clear and reproducible linear dose-dependent increase in micronucleus frequencies in this assay. Generally, mutagenic activity of the chemicals was found in the absence of severe cytotoxicity and/or cell cycle delay. The DNA breakage capacity and the cytotoxicity of these chemicals were also assessed in the alkaline single cell gel (SCG) electrophoresis test (comet assay) with and without S 9 -mix in isolated human lymphocytes. All chemical compounds induced DNA breakage, in the presence or absence of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> <b>system,</b> at the doses tested. The data showed that the DNA reactivity of the chemicals increased with increasing degree of halogenation. The results of the present work suggested that the comet assay might be a more suitable and sensitive screening method than the micronucleus test for this particular class of compound. However, both assays do detect different endpoints. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The lung has the {{potential}} of metabolizing many foreign chemicals to a vast array of metabolites with different pharmacological and toxicological properties. Because many chemicals require <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> in order to exert their toxicity, the cellular distribution of the drug-metabolizing enzymes in a heterogeneous tissue, such as the lung, and the balance of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> and deactivation pathways in any particular cell are key factors in determining the cellular specificity of many pulmonary toxins. Environmental factors such as air pollution, cigarette smoking, and diet markedly affect the pulmonary metabolism of some chemicals and, thereby, possibly affect their toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Pentachlorophenol (PCP), {{a widely}} used biocide, induces liver tumors in mice {{but not in}} rats. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of PCP to {{chlorinated}} quinones and semiquinones in liver cytosol from Spraque-Dawley rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice was investigated in vitro(1) with microsomes {{in the presence of}} either beta -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) : (2) with CK in the absence of microsomes, and (3) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H(2) O(2). Mono-S- and multi-S-substituted adducts of tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (Cl(4) - 1, 4 -BQ) and Cl(4) - 1, 2 -BQ and their corresponding semiquinones [i. e. tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzosemiquinone (Cl(4) - 1, 4 -SQ) and tetrachloro- 1 : 2 -benzosemiquinone (Cl(4) - 1, 2 -SQ) ] were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CrC-MS).

40|$|Heterocyclic amines get {{entry into}} human body mainly through {{ingestion}} of pan-fried meats cooked at high temperatures. Exposure of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to ingested xenobiotics {{prior to delivery}} to the liver may lead to <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation,</b> which may explain {{the high incidence of}} GIT carcinogenesis. Therefore, this study investigated the mutagenic activation of 2 heterocyclic amines, 2 -aminoanthracene (2 -AA) and 3 -amino- 1 -methyl- 5 H-prydo[4, 3 -b]indole (Trp-P- 2), in the GIT of rats. In addition, the constitutive mRNA expression profiles of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) in the GIT of rats were examined. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of 2 -AA was detected in all GIT tissues except the duodenum and rectum, and it was detected at high levels in the ileum and cecum. Furthermore, we revealed high <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of 2 -AA and Trp-P- 2 in the jejunum. The mRNA expression of phase I and II enzymes in rat GIT corresponded with their mutagenic activation ability. In conclusion, our results suggest that different expression levels of XME among GIT tissues may contribute to the tissue-specific differences in <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of xenobiotics such as heterocyclic amines in rats. Practical Application This study declares mutagenic activation of 2 heterocyclic amines namely 2 -aminoanthracene (2 -AA) and 3 -amino- 1 -methyl- 5 H-prydo[4, 3 -b]indole (Trp-P- 2), in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of rats. In addition, results obtained in this study suggest that GIT tissue-specific expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may contribute to the tissue-specific mutagenesis/carcinogenesis...|$|R
