5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period.

5|$|Udell {{recorded}} that in {{the late}} afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.|$|E

The chews contained either a placebo or an “active” product (100  mg of a bitter orange extract, standardized to 51. 5 mg p-synephrine). Subjects completed a 13 -item Weight Control Support Scale (WCSS) containing eating control, energy level, and palatability subscales daily throughout the study. All 40 subjects completed the study. No adverse effects were reported in either the placebo or active groups. As compared to placebo, subjects consuming the active product reported statistically more (p≤ 0. 001) positive responses on the WCSS {{as well as on}} each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three subscales. This study suggests that, as compared to a placebo control, consuming a chew containing bitter orange extract (51. 5 mg p-synephrine) 15 – 30 min before <b>the</b> two largest <b>meals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day resulted in a statistically significant greater and more positive response to eating/appetite control and a weight-control support scale.

5|$|While {{overseen by}} Heston Blumenthal, the head chef {{in the kitchen}} is Ashley Palmer-Watts. Palmer-Watts has {{previously}} worked with Blumenthal since 1999, and for five years was head chef at Blumenthal's other restaurant, the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck. The two chefs researched historical menu choices {{with help from the}} British Library and food historians. Blumenthal's first experience of historical cuisine was in 2000 when he discovered a recipe for roast chicken which required the bird to be plucked alive, and then cooked with a small volume of mercury. This was further enhanced as he filmed Heston's Feasts for Channel 4, in which he created a variety of feasts from different historical eras including Tudor, Medieval and Victorian. Despite being called Dinner, the restaurant is also open for lunch as the meaning of the name is intended to be the main <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, regardless of the time at which it is eaten.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
25|$|The Nunivak Eskimos (Nuniwarmiut in Cup'ig, Nunivaarmiut in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) ate {{frequently}} {{in the course of}} a 24-hour period. They went to bed at sundown or early evening in the spring and fall, and well before sundown in summer, but arose early, often at 3:00 or 4:00a.m. and regularly at 5:00 or 5:30. The time of rising depended on the sea tide and the time when tomcod or other fish would be running. The first <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day was eaten at this time and another about 11:00a.m., with snacks once or twice in between depending on the work schedule and the availability of food. The evening meal was usually at 4:30 or 5:00p.m. with additional snacks between the main meals. In winter the entire meal schedule was likely to be moved forward, with the first <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day being eaten at 10:00 or 10:30a.m. The most common food was dried or frozen fish dipped in seal oil. The evening or late afternoon meal, the hot <b>meal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, frequently consisted of boiled fish or other boiled food and tea.|$|E

The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise. The meal is mostly accompanied by beer, on occassion also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.|$|R

50|$|Bodybuilders often split {{their food}} intake {{for the day}} into 5 to 7 <b>meals</b> <b>of</b> roughly equal {{nutritional}} content and attempt to eat at regular intervals (e.g. every 2 to 3 hours).

Contrary to popular belief, eating more frequently does not increase basal metabolic rate {{when compared to the}} traditional 3 meals a day. While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called <b>the</b> thermic effect <b>of</b> food, it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day.
