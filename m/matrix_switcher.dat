5000|$|Video Switcher - The video <b>matrix</b> <b>switcher</b> sends {{video from}} a {{selected}} source the appropriate display. AMX uses {{a variety of}} proprietary technologies (such as SmartScale for image resolution scaling and InstaGate Pro for HDCP key handing) to ensure fast, reliable switching of video while maintaining source video quality.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} achievements of High End Systems was {{the introduction of the}} DMX-controlled media server called Catalyst in 2002. Up until that point, media servers were manually-operated systems where the media, either tape or video computer files, were switched using a push button <b>matrix</b> <b>switcher</b> or a T-handle switcher to crossfade between sources. In 2000, High End Systems introduced a digital projection system with a video projector, Orbital Mirror Head, and a DMX-controlled media server that interfaced with a lighting console. It allowed a lighting programmer to program the video switching and effects into the lighting console and play them back as part of the light show. The first such system was called Catalyst, but Catalyst evolved into the DMX-controlled media server while the Orbital Mirror Head was marketed alone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{space is}} {{surrounded}} by [...] "smart glass" [...] that can be frosted by pressing a button. The lab features flexible, ergonomic seating, a Christie MicroTiles display wall touch-enabled for up to 20 simultaneous touches and a custom 8-foot gaming bridge console with a 20” AMX Modero X touch panel for room control. The lab is further equipped with a Sennheiser K-array 5.1 surround sound system with BiAmp AudiaFlex audio processing, a custom, liquid-cooled game server with dual NVIDIA GTX 690 graphics cards and with an overclocked Intel i7 quad-core processor with 256GB SSD, 32GB memory and 10Ge Ethernet. Gamers {{have access to a}} Mac Pro game and visualization server, three fixed consoles (an Xbox One, a PlayStation 4 and a Wii U), a Samsung Blu-ray disc player, AppleTV, Cisco digital media player, Vista Spyder Video Wall Processor, Extron XTP Crosspoint <b>matrix</b> <b>switcher</b> and three mobile game carts with Xbox, PlayStation 3 and Wii.|$|E
5000|$|... 2001: Expanded {{product line}} to include Scalers, Scan Converters and Presentation <b>Matrix</b> <b>switchers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Looping video outputs {{for each}} input which duplicates the {{corresponding}} input video signal and connector type. These output signals {{are used by}} other video equipment such as <b>matrix</b> <b>switchers,</b> multiplexers, and video monitors.|$|R
50|$|The Kramer line {{consists}} of over 1000 products and includes distribution amplifiers, line drivers, <b>switchers,</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>switchers,</b> presentation switchers, In-CTRL seamless switchers, ProScale digital scaler/switchers, scalers, scan converters, twisted pair transmission products, Cobra twisted pair products for long distance applications, media/room control products, SummitView integrated media/room control systems, format converters, interfaces, protocol translators, IR products, test pattern generators, fiber optic transmission products, rack mounts, wall plates, bulk cable, cable assemblies and cable accessories. In many cases, Kramer offers three {{versions of a}} product {{to meet the needs}} of various applications. They generally have a rack-mount version, a desktop version and a Kramer TOOLS version. Kramer TOOLS are extremely compact product solutions ideal for solving basic signal management problems.|$|R
50|$|For example, an S-Video <b>matrix</b> routing <b>switcher</b> {{with the}} same {{capability}} (8×8) as a 16-point S-Video patch panel (8 patch cables connects 8 inputs and 8 outputs) may cost ten times more, though it would probably have more capabilities, including audio-follow-video and built-in distribution amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|MIDI Show Control (MSC) {{devices such}} as show controllers, which {{transmit}} messages {{to aid in the}} operation and cueing of live theatrical and themed entertainment productions. For example, a variety of show control sub systems such as sound consoles, sound playback controllers, virtual audio <b>matrices</b> and <b>switchers,</b> video playback systems, rigging controllers, pyro and lighting control systems directly respond to MSC commands. However, most standalone generic MSC controllers are intended to actuate a generic computerised show control system which has been carefully programmed to produce the complex desired results that the show demands at each moment of the production.|$|R
