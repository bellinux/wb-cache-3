5000|$|Released after Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star {{and joined}} by Steve Shelley on drums and Tim Foljahn on second guitar, Moore's femme-themed solo debut, Psychic Hearts, is a {{collection}} of often-beautiful sunset guitar rock. Of his vocal turns, <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> the caffeinated, teen-angst/dysfunction of the propulsive title track. Moore's vocals are also particularly swoon-worthy on the whispery [...] "Pretty Bad" [...] and breathy [...] "Ono Soul".Most of Psychic Hearts, however, works because of the simple repetitions of instrumentals like lilting opener [...] "Blues From Beyond the Grave" [...] and the gently paranoid [...] "(I Got a) Catholic Block" [...] patterning that surfaces between Moore's voice in [...] "Feathers". The centerpiece is the 20-minute instrumental exeunt, [...] "Elegy for All the Dead Rock *s". The track's distinct movements mingle fluidly, swerving into a sideways cascade before bursting and blooming until notes sharpen and a final tidal wave arcs and releases. The noise implosions of its final third are anti-climactic, but after some gentle plucks and slides, Moore grabs his pick and glides into that dark night as gorgeously as he began, only this time with more triumphal drums.|$|E

40|$|R (R Development Core Team 2008) is the {{open-source}} (read: free-of-charge) {{version of}} the language S. It {{is best known as}} a package that performs statistical analysis and graphics. However, R is so much more: it is a high-level language in which one can perform complex calculations, implement new methods, and make high-quality figures. R has high-level functions to operate on matrices, perform numerical integration, advanced statistics, [...] . which are easily triggered and which make it ideally suited for datavisualization, statistical analysis and mathematical modeling. It is the aim of these lecture notes to make you acquainted with the R language. The lecture notes are based on a book (Soetaert and Herman 2009) about ecological modelling in which R is extensively used for developing, applying and visualizing simulation models. There are many excellent sources for learning the R (or S) language. R comes with several manuals that can be consulted from the main R program (Help/Manuals). R-intro. pdf is a good start. Many other good introductions to R are available, some freely on the web, and accessible via the R web site (www. r-project. org). <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> the R introduction by Petra Kuhnert and Bill Venables (Kuhnert and Venables 2005), but beware: this ”introduction ” comprises more than 300 pages...|$|E

40|$|I {{suspect that}} Dr. Senn {{is a hero}} to many readers of this journal. He has been a fervent {{advocate}} {{of the quality of}} work done by pharmaceutical statisticians in a day and age where many dismiss any research touched by commercial interests (Senn, 2005, 2006). He also argues loud and forcefully for patients when their lives are trampled by unethical demands of the research enterprise (Senn, 1997, 2003 a). He has written the definitive work on crossover trials (Senn, 2002), and a wonderfully readable account of statistics in medicine for the lay public (Senn, 2003 b).

40|$|Copyright c○ 2005 by C. T. Kelley 1 The {{objective}} of this chapter is to study parameter dependent nonlinear equations of the form (0. 1) F (u, λ) = 0, as the parameter λ varies. Here u ∈ R N, λ is real, and F: R N+ 1 → R N. In many cases the parameter λ has a physical meaning, representing a load, voltage drop, fluid velocity, or a chemical concentration, for example. We will consider only scalar λ in this book, and will denote ∂F/∂λ by Fλ. The Jacobian matrix of F with respect to u will be denoted Fu. Throughout this chapter we will assume that F is Lipschitz continuously differentiable. There are many good books completely devoted to this topic, <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> [5], which focuses mostly on time-independent problems. For in-depth surveys of time-dependent problems see [3, 8]. The style of proofs in this chapter, like that of [5], {{is intended to be}} direct and specific, rather than maximally general. We will work through some examples of differential and integral equations, and when we do that we will express things in terms of the continuous problem, not a discretization. Most of the time our conclusions for the continuous problem will also be valid for any sensible discretization. In infinite dimension, the derivative of a nonlinear map is not a Jacobian matrix, but rather a linear operator called the Fréchet derivative. DEFINITION 0. 1. A nonlinear map F on a Banach space X is Fréchet differentiable at x ∈ X if there is a bounded linear operator A on X such ‖F (x + w) − F (x) − Aw‖ li...|$|E
40|$|David Landes is the doyen of the ‘‘technologist’ ’ {{school of}} {{economic}} historians. His brilliant Unbound Prometheus still remains the best book {{to understand the}} technological and scientific mainsprings of the Industrial Revolution. While that book was more concerned with why the technolog-ical revolution occurred in Britain and not {{in other parts of}} Europe, his new book, concerned again with explaining the European Miracle, is more global. The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is filled with much detail and innumerable memorable anecdotes. <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> the one he relates about the aftermath of Chernobyl. A farmer is selling ‘‘apples under a big sign, APPLES FROM CHERNOBYL. ‘You must be mad, ’ says a passerby. ‘No one wants to buy apples from Chernobyl. ’ ‘Sure they do,’ says the vendor. ‘Some people buy them for their mother-in-law, others for their wife. ’ (And maybe others for their husband) ’ ’ (p. 498). There is a wealth of learning lightly displayed in the book, though I did find his discussion of many Third World countries a trifle superficial. He is also not impressed much by economics. There are some alarming passages showing a lack of understanding of the modern theory of trade and development, and also of the economics of developing countries. At the end of the book, moreover, I was left feeling that Landes had still not provided a convincing answer to the question he set himself to answer as summarized by the subtitle of the book. He is too subtle a historian to give a purely unicausal explanation of the rise of the West— even though, given the amount of space devoted to it, his heart is clearly in the purely ‘‘technological’ ’ explanations. He summarizes the accepted differences between the West and the Rest, which led to the former’s dominance. Among the more important are the European states system that limited predation by the state and led to growing security of property rights, and the inquisitive Greek spirit that led to the routinization of science and cumulative technological advance.
