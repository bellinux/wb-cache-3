40|$|In vivo {{reconstitution}} of the TDP-l-megosamine pathway {{from the}} <b>megalomicin</b> gene cluster of Micromonospora megalomicea {{was accomplished by}} the heterologous expression of its biosynthetic genes in Escherichia coli. Mass spectrometric analysis of the TDP-sugar intermediates produced from operons containing different sets of genes showed that the production of TDP-l-megosamine from TDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxy-d-glucose requires only five biosynthetic steps, catalyzed by MegBVI, MegDII, MegDIII, MegDIV, and MegDV. Bioconversion studies demonstrated that the sugar transferase MegDI, along with the helper protein MegDVI, catalyzes the transfer of l-megosamine to either erythromycin C or erythromycin D, suggesting two possible routes {{for the production of}} <b>megalomicin</b> A. Analysis in vivo of the hydroxylation step by MegK indicated that erythromycin C is the intermediate of <b>megalomicin</b> A biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{inducibility}} of ermC by erythromycin, <b>megalomicin,</b> and celesticetin {{was tested}} with both wild-type ermC and several regulatory mutants altered in the 19 -amino-acid-residue leader peptide, MGIFSIFVISTVHYQP NKK. In the model test {{system that was}} used, the ErmC methylase was translationally fused to beta-galactosidase. Mutational alterations that mapped in the interval encoding Phe- 4 through Ile- 9 of the leader peptide not only affected induction by individual antibiotics, but did so differentially. The subset of mutations that affected inducibility by the two macrolides erythromycin and <b>megalomicin</b> overlapped and were distinct from the subset of mutations that affected induction by celesticetin. These studies provide a model system for experimentally varying the relative efficiencies with which different antibiotics induce the expression of ermC. The possibility that antibiotics with inducing activity interact directly with the nascent leader peptide was tested by using a chemically synthesized decapeptide, MGIFSIFVIS [...] , attached at its C-terminus to a solid-phase support. This peptide, however, failed to bind erythromycin in vitro...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{inhibitory}} {{effects on}} HIV replication of <b>megalomicin</b> (MGM), an inhibitor of intra-Golgi vesicle transport, have been studied. In experiments at low {{multiplicity of infection}} on Jurkat and MT 2 cell lines, MGM inhibited the production of p 24 antigen, the formation of syncytia, and the induction of apoptosis at concentrations below 5 μM. Furthermore, PCR analysis of genomic DNA showed that, {{in the presence of}} MGM, HIV- 1 had been eradicated from the culture. MGM also inhibited replication of primary isolates of HIV- 1 in blood lymphoblasts and more importantly, at 1 μM, MGM inhibited depletion of CD 4 +T cells in cultures of blood lymphocytes from seropositive patients. Finally, MGM inhibited the generation of infectious virions and the processing of the envelope protein precursor gp 160 to its mature forms, resulting in the rapid degradation of gp 160. These data suggest that MGM induces a powerful inhibitory effect on HIV- 1 replication at nontoxic concentrations by preventing the processing of HIV- 1 gp 160 envelope protein and the subsequent formation of infectious viral particles...|$|E
40|$|The erm {{family of}} 23 S rRNA adenine-N 6 -methyltransferases confers {{resistance}} to all macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLS) antibiotics, {{but not all}} MLS antibiotics induce synthesis of Erm methyltransferase with equal efficiency in a given organism. The induction efficiency of a test panel of MLS antibiotics was studied by using two translational attenuator-lac reporter gene fusion constructs, one based on ermSV from Streptomyces viridochromogenes NRRL 2860 and the other based on ermC from Staphylococcus aureus RN 2442. Four types of responses which were correlated with the macrolide ring size were seen, as follows: group 1, both ermSV and ermC were induced by the 14 -membered-ring macrolides erythromycin, lankamycin, and matromycin, {{as well as by}} the lincosamide celesticetin; group 2, neither ermSV nor ermC was induced by the 12 -membered-ring macrolide methymycin or by the lincosamide lincomycin or the streptogramin type B antibiotic ostreogrycin B; group 3, ermSV was selectively induced over ermC by the 16 -membered-ring macrolides carbomycin, chalco-mycin, cirramycin, kitasamycin, maridomycin, and tylosin; and group 4, ermC was selectively induced over ermSV by the 14 -membered-ring macrolide <b>megalomicin.</b> These data suggest that the leader peptide determines the specificity of induction by different classes of MLS antibiotics and that for a given attenuator, a major factor which determines whether a given macrolide induces resistance is its size. The erm family of rRNA methylases is one of the majo...|$|E
40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} is {{the assembly}} {{site for a}} number of complex enveloped viruses. Using high-preserva-tion methods for electron microscopy, we have detected two previously unknown maturation steps in the morphogenesis of Bunyamwera virus in BHK- 21 cells. The first maturation takes place inside the Golgi stack, where annular immature particles transform into dense, compact structures. <b>Megalomicin,</b> a drug that disrupts the trans side of the Golgi complex, reversibly blocks transformation, showing that a functional trans-Golgi is needed for maturation. The second structural change seems to take place during the egress of viral particles from cells, when a coat of round-shaped spikes becomes evident. A fourth viral assembly was detected in infected cells: rigid tubular structures assemble in the Golgi region early in infection and frequently connect with mitochondria. In Vero cells, the virus induces an early and spectacular fragmentation of intracellular membranes while productive infection progresses. Assembly occurs in fragmented Golgi stacks and generates tubular structures, as well as the three spherical viral forms. These results, together with our previous studies with nonrelated viruses, show that the Golgi complex contains key factors for the structural transformation of a number of enveloped viruses that assemble intracellularly. Enveloped viruses are able to use a variety of cellular mem-branes at different steps of their life cycles. In fact, almost an...|$|E
40|$|The {{macrolide}} antibiotic <b>megalomicin</b> (MGM) {{has been}} shown to inhibit vesicular transport between the medial- and trans-Golgi, resulting in the undersialylation of cellular proteins (P. Bonay, S. Munro, M. Fresno, and B. Alarcón, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 3719 – 3726, 1996). Due to the effects of MGM on the Golgi and on the replication of enveloped viruses, we decided to test whether it has any antiparasitic activity. The results showed that MGM has potent activity against the epimastigote stage of Trypanosoma cruzi, producing a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0. 2 mg/ml. Furthermore, MGM was also active against the intracellular replicative, amastigote form of T. cruzi, completely preventing its replication in infected murine LLC/MK 2 macrophages at a dose of 5 mg/ml. Although less potent, MGM was also active against Trypanosoma brucei epimastigotes (IC 50, 2 mg/ml) and Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major promastigotes (IC 50, 3 and 8 mg/ml, respec-tively). MGM also blocked intracellular replication of the asexual stage of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes at 1 mg/ml. Finally, MGM was active in an in vivo model, resulting in the complete protection of BALB/c mice from death caused by acute T. brucei infection and significantly reducing the parasitemia. These results suggest that MGM is a potential drug for the treatment of veterinary and human parasitic diseases. There is wide variation in the availability and efficacy of drugs for the therapy and prophylaxis of parasitic diseases, i...|$|E
40|$|Cumin is an annual, aromatic, herbaceous, medicinal, spice plant, {{most widely}} used as a food {{additive}} and flavoring agent in different cuisines. The study is intended to comprehensively analyse physiological parameters, biochemical composition and metabolites under salinity stress. Seed germination index, rate of seed emergence, rate of seed germination, mean germination time, plant biomass, total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents decreased concomitantly with salinity. In contrast, total antioxidant activity, H 2 O 2, proline and MDA contents increased concurrently with stress treatments. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were decreased initially about 1. 4 -fold at 50 mM, and thereafter increased about 1. 2 -fold at 100 mM NaCl stress. Relative water content remained unchanged up to 50 mM NaCl stress, and thereafter decreased significantly. About 2. 8 -fold electrolyte leakage was found in 50 mM, which increases further 4 -fold at 100 mM NaCl stress. Saturated fatty acids (FAs) increased gradually with salinity, whereas unsaturation index and degree of unsaturation change arbitrarily along with the percent quantity of unsaturated FAs. Total lipid and fatty acid composition were significantly influenced by salinity stress. A total of 45 differentially expressed metabolites were identified, including luteolin, salvianolic acid, kaempferol and quercetin, which are phenolic, flavonoid or alkaloids in nature and contain antioxidant activities. Additionally, metabolites with bioactivity such as anticancerous (docetaxel) and antimicrobial (<b>megalomicin)</b> properties were also identified. The study evidenced that plant shoots are {{a rich source of}} metabolites, essential amino acids, phenolic compounds and fatty acids, which unveil the medicinal potential of this plant, and also provide useful insight about metabolic responses under salinity stress...|$|E
40|$|An Escherichia coli strain {{capable of}} {{producing}} the potent antibiotic erythromycin C (Ery C) was developed by expressing 17 new heterologous genes in a 6 -deoxyerythronolide B (6 dEB) producer strain. The <b>megalomicin</b> gene cluster {{was used as the}} source for the construction of two artificial operons that contained the genes encoding the deoxysugar biosynthetic and tailoring enzymes necessary to convert 6 dEB to Ery C. The reconstructed mycarose operon contained the seven genes coding for the enzymes that convert glucose- 1 -phosphate (G- 1 -P) to TDP-l-mycarose, a 6 dEB mycarosyl transferase, and a 6 dEB 6 -hydroxylase. The activity of the pathway was confirmed by demonstrating conversion of exogenous 6 dEB to 3 -O-α-mycarosylerythronolide B (MEB). The reconstructed desosamine operon contained the six genes necessary to convert TDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxyglucose, an intermediate formed in the mycarose pathway, to TDP-d-desosamine, a desosamine transferase, a 6 dEB 12 -hydroxylase, and the rRNA methyltransferase ErmE; the last was required to confer resistance to the host cell upon production of mature macrolide antibiotics. The activity of this pathway was demonstrated by conversion of MEB to Ery C. When the mycarose and desosamine operons were expressed in an E. coli strain engineered to synthesize 6 dEB, Ery C and Ery D were produced. The successful production of Ery C in E. coli shows the potentiality of this model microorganism to synthesize novel 6 -deoxysugars and to produce bioactive glycosylated compounds and also establishes the basis for the future use of E. coli both in the production of new glycosylated polyketides and for the generation of novel bioactive compounds through combinatorial biosynthesis...|$|E
