40|$|According to William Edwards Deming “Good quality {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mean high quality. Instead it means a predicable degree of uniformity and dependability at low cost with a quality suited to the market. ” Whereas according to famous engineer and management consultant Joseph M. Juran quality is “fitness for purpose”. It should meet the customers’ expectations and requirements, should be cost effective. ISO began in 1926 as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA). The name, "ISO" was derived from the Greek word "isos" meaning "equal". (The relation to standards is that if two objects meet the same standard, they should be equal.) This name eliminates any confusion that could result from the translation of "International Organization for Standardization" into different languages which would lead to different acronyms. In health sector, quality plays pivotal role, as it is directly related to patient’s care. Earlier time, health service was simple, quite safe but ineffective. Now health care system is an organizational system with more complex processes to deliver care. <b>Medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>service</b> is an integral part in patient’s management system. So, for everyone involved in the treatment of the patient, the accuracy, reliability and safety of those services must be the primary concerns. Accreditation is a significant enabler of quality, thereby delivering confidence to healthcare providers, clinicians, the <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> and the patients themselves. ISO announced meeting in Philadelphia to form a technical committee to develop a new standard for <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> quality. It took 7 years {{for the creation of a}} new Quality standard for <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> It was named as “ISO 15189 ” and was first published in 2003. The ISO has released three versions of the standard. The first two were released in 2003 and 2007. In 2012, a revised and updated version of the standard, ISO 15189 : 2012 (<b>Medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> – Requirements for quality and competence) was released. ISO 15189 is a globally recognized standard that help <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> to develop their quality management systems and assess their competence. The standard is concerned with improving patient safety, risk mitigation and operational efficiency within <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories,</b> where they directly impact upon the continuum of care. To help it achieve this, ISO 15189 specifies quality criteria relating to both technical and managerial competence. Accreditation not only helps patients but also health care organization. It stimulates to seek for continuous improvement and enables the health care organization in demonstrating commitment to quality of care. Furthermore it raises community confidence in the services provided along with international recognition of services. Ultimately it increases revenue of the institution. Accreditation benefits all stake holders, patients/customers are the biggest beneficiary. It results in high quality of care and patients/customer safety as they get services by credentialed staff. Accreditation ensures that rights of patients are respected and protected and their satisfaction is regularly evaluated. Thus, Accreditation can be the single most important approach for improving the quality of health care structures. In an accreditation system, institutional resources, processes and outcome are evaluated continuously to ensure quality of services is maintained and improved on the basis of appropriated standards and regulatory requirements. </p...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the seroprevalence of dengue virus IgG antibodies and dengue/malaria coinfection among febrile HIV-infected patients attending the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, blood samples from 178 consenting HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy were collected and tested for plasmodiasis and anti-Dengue virus IgG using malaria microscopy and ELISA, respectively. Interviewer-based questionnaires were used to assess subjects’ sociodemographic variables and dengue risk factors. Results: Of the 178 screened participants, 44. 4 % were seropositive for dengue virus IgG antibody, whereas 29. 2 % were positive for Plasmodium falciparum. About 44. 2 % were positive for both dengue virus and P. falciparum. There was a statistical association between anti-dengue IgG and occupation (p= 0. 03) but not with age, residential area, educational level and patients’ gender (p> 0. 05).

Malignant enlargements must be differentiated from benign enlargements for adequate treatment of each patient. High serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels suggest malignancy, {{but some of the}} biopsies done due to a serum tPSA value > 4 ng/mL would be negative for malignancy because of the low specificity of tPSA for prostate cancer. This study aims to compare the histologic findings of all prostate specimens obtained from core needle biopsy, open simple prostatectomy, and transurethral resection of the prostate with the respective serum tPSA values in an attempt to decipher the role of serum tPSA in the management of these patients. Methods: The case notes of patients attended to from April 2009 to March 2012 were analyzed. Essentially, the age of the patient, findings on digital rectal examination, abdominopelvic ultrasonography report on the prostate, serum tPSA, and histology reports from biopsy or prostatectomy specimens as indicated were extracted for analysis. Results: The relationship between age, findings on digital rectal examination, serum tPSA, abdominopelvic ultrasonography report, and histology are compared.

40|$|Biomedical {{science is}} a {{sensitive}} discipline and presents unique challenges {{due to its}} social character, continuous development and competitiveness. The issue of quality management systems and accreditation is gaining increasing interest in this sector. All over Europe, Health Services Units have started to introduce quality management systems and harmonization of criteria for accreditation is of increasing importance. Moreover, clinical laboratories, like the Assisted Reproduction laboratories and biochemical laboratories are required to apply a Quality Management System {{in order to ensure}} their correct, scientific and effective operation. Ultimately, it is a moral obligation for every health care organisation to supply the best possible care for the patient. The specific features and the diversity of clinical laboratories led to the introduction (2003) and, recently to the revision (2007) of the international standard ISO 15189, which is the first international standard developed specifically to address the requirements for accreditation of this type of laboratory. The basic principles for the quality assurance in the clinical laboratories are: x Complete and unambiguous standardized operating procedures. x Complete and unambiguous directives of operation. x Obligatory detailed written documentation, i. e., how each action is done, who will do it, where will this action take place and when. x Suitable scheduling of calibration/control/preventive maintenance of laboratory equipment and recording of each activity. x Distribution of responsibilities among the staff and continuous education and briefing according to current scientific data. x Complete and informed record file keeping. x Continuous improvement which is monitored with the adoption of quantified indicators. x Internal and external audit of all activities. x Troubleshooting. All these principles should be supported by the Management in order that the necessary adaptations should be made in the provision of human resources, equipment, supplies and working environment and the resolution of organisational problems.

This working group included provision of advice to users of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>service,</b> the collection of patient samples, the interpretation of test results, acceptable turnaround times, how testing is to be provided in a medical emergency and the labs role in the education and training of health care staff.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers of {{in vitro}} {{diagnostic}} (IVD) <b>medical</b> devices and <b>laboratory</b> management have become integral partners in building {{and improving the}} quality of <b>laboratory</b> <b>services.</b> There is an increasing awareness that quality is inherent in the design of any reagent or analytical system. In vitro diagnostic medical devices should provide patients, users and third parties {{with a high level of}} health protection. Therefore, both manufacturers and users must work in partnership for continual improvement. For manufacturers, standards such as ISO 9000 already exist to guide applications of quality practices. In the field of laboratory medicine, the availability of a specific, universal standard (ISO/DIS 15189) for quality management in <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> will represent a great opportunity for harmonising <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> at an international level. In addition, accreditation of <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> according to the proposed ISO 15189 standard can help develop the relationships between laboratories, and the biological follow-up of travelling patients. Manufacturers are able to help laboratory management to reach a high level of quality, not only by providing high value products, but also on the basis of their own experience of ISO 9000 certification.

40|$|This {{monograph}} develops an evidence-based redesign {{plan for}} a key support service in the country’s health system. It {{is based on a}} doctoral thesis that evaluated the impact of market-style health resource control of New Zealand’s clinical <b>laboratory</b> <b>services.</b> The monograph summarises material detailed in the thesis, and extrapolates from it to make the following recommendations for improved cost-efficiency: 1) Competitive contracting as a means of price control for diagnostic <b>laboratory</b> <b>services</b> should be abandoned. 2) Laboratory remuneration should be cost-based and independent of specimen origin. 3) Costing methodology already developed and tested in Australia should be introduced here in order to define remuneration formulae. 4) A <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Service</b> Advisory Committee, representatives of clinical laboratories in both sectors, should provide service-related advice to the Ministry of Health. 5) Regionally representative laboratory committees should be charged with planning and co-ordinating district <b>laboratory</b> <b>services,</b> in the interests of cost-efficiency. 6) Interactive electronic expert systems should be developed in major regional laboratories as a counter to clinical laboratory misuse. 7) Technology retraining programmes aimed at achieving suitable <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> technologist redeployment within the health system should be instated in main centres. Long-term, providers of workforce training should aim at developing greater flexibility in the health technology workforce...|$|R
