Despite the reaction of industry experts, Microsoft {{reported that they had}} sold 100 million licenses in the first six months. This <b>matched</b> <b>sales</b> of Windows 7 over a similar period.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method is}} to have a spreadsheet that shows cash coming in from all sources out to at least 90 days, and all cash going out for the same period. This requires that the quantity and timings of receipts of cash from sales are reasonably accurate, which in turn requires judgement honed by experience of the industry concerned, because it is rare for cash receipts to <b>match</b> <b>sales</b> forecasts exactly, and it is also rare for customers all to pay on time. These principles remain constant whether the cash flow forecasting is done on a spreadsheet or on paper or on some other IT system.|$|R

25|$|This {{was also}} a period when the Italian Fascist {{government}} undertook a large-scale privatization policy, which {{was among the first}} such policies in the modern world. Fascist Italy was the only country that sold state-owned enterprises and assets to private firms in the 1920s; the next country to adopt this approach was Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The Italian privatizations included the sale of most state-owned telephone networks and services, as well as the former state monopoly on <b>match</b> <b>sale.</b> The state monopoly on life insurance was eliminated, the metal machinery firm Ansaldo was returned to private ownership (after having been nationalized by the previous government), and private firms were awarded concessions to set up tolls on motorways.|$|R

While ideological considerations {{may have had a}} certain influence, privatization was used mainly as a political tool to build confidence among industrialists and to increase support for the government and the Partito Nazionale Fascista.

5000|$|Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess is a chess puzzle {{book written}} by Bobby Fischer and co-authored by Stuart Margulies and Don Mosenfelder. It is {{intended}} for beginners and uses a programmed learning approach. [...] The book was originally published in 1966 by Basic Systems Inc, a subsidiary of Xerox. A paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in 1967 and sold 10,000 copies by early 1972. Due to the interest in the Fischer-Spassky world championship <b>match,</b> <b>sales</b> increased dramatically and the book was reprinted eight times in 1972 alone. It is the best-selling chess book ever published, with over one million copies sold. In 1994, Interplay Entertainment released a computer chess program {{of the same name}} based on the book.|$|R
5000|$|The Bryant and May factory {{received}} {{bad publicity}} from these events, and in 1901 they announced that their factory no longer used white phosphorus. The owners Francis May and William Bryant, who were both Quakers, had started importing red-phosphorus based safety matches from John Edvard Lundström, in Sweden, in 1850. [...] However, Bryant and May's safety <b>matches</b> <b>sales</b> had increased 10-fold by 1855 and Lundstrom {{was unable to}} increase his production any further so they bought his British patent, and with his assistance, built a model safety match factory in Bow. They started using red phosphorus in 1855, but could not compete on price against the much cheaper white phosphorus-based matches; hence the use of child labour.|$|R

5000|$|Garthwaite and Moore <b>matched</b> <b>sales</b> of Winfrey's [...] "O" [...] {{magazine}} and the spike in sales of her book club picks to Obama's votes in the Democratic primary. After controlling for a large range of confounding {{factors such as the}} fact that both Obama and Winfrey are popular with African Americans, Garthwaite and Moore showed that votes for Obama spiked in precisely the same geographic areas where Winfrey is the most popular. By applying the same methodology to Obama's 2004 Senate race, when he did not have Winfrey's endorsement, they found no relationship between Obama votes and Winfrey popularity in Illinois; the relationship only emerged after the endorsement, suggesting that Winfrey’s endorsement had caused the spike in Obama’s vote total in those counties.|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of calculating damages in securities litigation is often {{compounded by the}} phenomenon of investors that have accrued both gains and losses {{as a result of}} the defendant company’s same fraudulent misrepresentations. This Note traces the opposing damages approaches and accounting methods courts have adopted in these instances to the dual origins and objectives of the Rule 10 b- 5 private right of action. Underscoring the shortcomings in these damages calculations founded predominantly upon either deterrent or compensatory grounds, this Note instead strives for a measure that not only balances both imperative ends but also yields a more sensible and equitable outcome. Namely, this Note proposes that losses should only be offset by gains when they are sufficiently linked by an ongoing trading strategy, and that <b>matching</b> <b>sales</b> of securities with the latest purchases will most clearly reflect gains and losses during the class period...|$|R
