50|$|In 2008, Takka Takka {{released}} {{their second}} full-length album, Migration. Produced by Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's drummer, Sean Greenhalgh, <b>Migration</b> <b>was</b> {{a departure from}} their first album. On Migration, Takka Takka explored minimalistic synthesizer soundscapes, African guitars and percussion poly-rhythms. The album features Bryan Devendorf, the drummer for The National and sometime percussionist for Takka Takka. <b>Migration</b> <b>was</b> released to semi-critical praise receiving positive reviews from the New York Times and Pitchfork.com. <b>Migration</b> <b>was</b> released in Europe in 2010 by Lili-is-pi records which brought the band to tour continental Europe for the first time.|$|R

5|$|Nocturnal {{migrants}} minimize predation, avoid overheating, and {{can feed}} during the day. One cost of nocturnal <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> {{the loss of}} sleep. Migrants {{may be able to}} alter their quality of sleep to compensate for the loss.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{developing}} neurons reach {{the core of}} the olfactory bulb, they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons. These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a framework developed for accommodating various object migrations in ‘statically-typed’ object databases. Requirements for supporting object <b>migrations</b> <b>are</b> stipulated, and a conceptual model for describing and facilitating {{different kinds of}} <b>migrations</b> <b>is</b> described. Associated issues of controlling such <b>migrations</b> <b>are</b> then addressed, along with an initial investigation on the inference of implied migration paths and the completeness of migration operators. Some guidelines are then given to help users conduct migrations more effectively. An implementation prototype {{on top of an}} object-oriented database system was built, which embodies full support of all migration types specified in the migration model...|$|R

5|$|The {{control of}} migration, its timing and {{response}} are genetically controlled {{and appear to}} be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.|$|E
5|$|When Lake Cahuilla filled, it {{may have}} {{encouraged}} Quechan people to migrate to the area. This <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be a}} possible source for the spread of agriculture to the Peninsular Ranges. Legends have it that lost ships, sometimes described as pirate ships or galleons, sailed Lake Cahuilla and are now buried somewhere in the Colorado Desert.|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> a form {{of short}} {{distance}} migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable {{due to lack of}} food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the ideas of unfree/free labour and voluntary/forced <b>migration</b> <b>are</b> explored in order to add a migration perspective to the debate on unfree labour. The role of migration {{in the creation of}} unfree labour is examined through the evolution of networks brought about by labour recruiters. The linkages between unfree labour and unfree <b>migration</b> <b>are</b> also examined with a particular focus on trafficking and smuggling. In both situations, clear distinctions are found to be elusive and much “leakage” exists from one category to another. The changing {{relationships between}} these categories and development are outlined. Cases from both internal and international <b>migration</b> <b>are</b> used to illustrate the argument...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{real-time}} diel {{pattern of}} Atlantic salmon smolt <b>migration</b> <b>was</b> observed for 8 years using automatic resistivity counters verified by video surveillance. A clear dominant nocturnal <b>migration</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated {{early in the}} migration period, later becoming increasingly diurnal, until rates became approximately equal at day and night. <b>Migration</b> patterns <b>were</b> related to water temperature, such that when mean daily temperatures were below 12 °C, hourly rates of <b>migration</b> <b>were</b> significantly lower during the day than at night. When daily mean temperatures exceeded 12 °C, {{there was no significant}} difference between diurnal and nocturnal migration rates. Migration patterns showed a distinct suppression of migration at dawn and dusk throughout the <b>migration</b> period. It <b>is</b> hypothesised that this behaviour is an active decision and/or an adaptive strategy either to take advantage of increased food in the form of invertebrate drift or to reduce predation risk from actively feeding piscivores or both...|$|R
5|$|Bird <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> {{the regular}} {{seasonal}} movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. <b>Migration</b> <b>is</b> usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Spring <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} quiet, although {{sightings of}} ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E

5|$|The best-known artistic {{representation}} of the Swedish mass <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> the epic four-novel suite The Emigrants (1949–1959) by Vilhelm Moberg (1898–1973). Portraying the lives of an emigrant family through several generations, the novels have sold nearly two million copies in Sweden and have been translated into more than twenty languages. The tetralogy has been filmed by Jan Troell as The Emigrants (1971) and The New Land (1972), and forms the basis of Kristina from Duvemåla, a 1995 musical by former ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand has {{a strong}} {{presence}} among the Pacific Island countries. A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment. Permanent <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it. New Zealand {{is involved in the}} Pacific Islands Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit).

5|$|Population {{figures for}} elk are {{in excess of}} 30,000—the largest {{population}} of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid‑1990s; this {{has been attributed to}} wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge, immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Ruralurban <b>migration</b> <b>is</b> {{significant}} in Bintulu because of greater job availability in the town. Since 2007, new residents have started several squatter areas in Bintulu due to inability to find affordable housing, around Kidurong Industrial estate and Sungai Sebatang. To address the issue, several low-cost housing projects were initiated by BDA and Sarawak state government to relocate the squatters. The state government planned to achieve zero squatters status {{by the year}} 2020. Bintulu also saw {{the rise in the}} number of residential and commercial properties such as double-storeyed terraced houses, terraced shopoffices, Kidurong Commercial Centre, and Time Square Shopping Mall. Residential properties has shown a 20% price increase from 2011 to 2013.|$|E
