40|$|The “Brazil” {{was built}} in 1890 by the Union Dry Dock Co., of Buffalo, New York. The steel {{propeller}} vessel experienced many name and ownership changes. She was originally built for M. M. Drake, et. al., of Buffalo, New York. In 1896, ownership transferred to John Kelderhouse, et. al., also of Buffalo. He owned her until 1904 when she was sold to the Wisconsin Transportation Co., of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Reconstruction of the hull took place in 1907 and they maintained ownership until 1913. The North American Steamship Co. (Roy A. Williams, Mgr.), of Cleveland, Ohio, purchased her next. They possessed the vessel until 1916 when she was bought by Boland & Cornelius, of Buffalo, NY. Within that same year, she was sold again to Lake Transportation Co. (James Playfair), of Cleveland, OH; they maintained ownership until 1919 when she was sold again to Great Lakes Transportation Co., Ltd. (James Playfair, Mgr.), of Midland, Ontario, Canada. Subsequently, the vessel was renamed “Glenbrae” and listed as Canadian vessel 138217. In 1929, the vessel was sold to <b>Marine</b> <b>Dredge</b> & Gravel Co., of Chicago, Illinois, assumed her original name “Brazil” and original registration number, and converted to a sand dredge by Toledo Shipbuilding Co [...] Lastly, ownership transferred again in 1931 to the Illinois Ship & Dredge Co., of Chicago, IL. In 1943, the vessel was abandoned and scrapped...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the summer}} of 1950, the present writer spent a three weeks' holiday {{dredging}} in the Great Bitter Lake. Plans to collect specimens in that area for the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden had, unfortunately, to be drawn up somewhat hurriedly, {{but at least the}} most essential equipment was complete {{by the beginning of the}} writer's stay at Fayed, on the western shore of the Lake. Between August 18 th and September 5 th, the Great Bitter Lake was explored as well as possible under the circumstances. The investigation discussed below was, as is fully realised, of a limited character; it consisted almost exclusively of operations for collecting marine organisms, though on a fairly large scale. However, it was considered preferable to do the work with the means available rather than let this chance slip for want of ideal circumstances, the more so because no extensive exploration of the bottom fauna of the Bitter Lake had ever been carried out in the past. The discovery of a few distinct plant zones in the Lake will, it is hoped, add to the ecological interest of the collections made. To Mr. J. Doorn, of the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd., the writer owes many thanks for the able manufacture of a most serviceable <b>marine</b> <b>dredge.</b> The Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez kindly made available a detailed hydrographic map of the Great Bitter Lake. The writer is also much indebted to Miss Dr. J. Th. Koster, Rijksherbarium, Leiden, for the identification of the collected plants. BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ The excavation of the Suez Canal has added much interest to the manifold problem of the extent of intermingling between marine faunal provinces...|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of cellular responses to increased sedimentation and temperature in Montastraea cavernosa collected off Broward County, Florida. We sampled corals from six different sites approximately, 500 – 1000 m off shore, 10 – 15 m depth. Six {{samples were collected}} from four sites adjacent to areas of underwater <b>marine</b> <b>dredging</b> (project sites), while the remaining two samples were obtained {{far away from the}} influence of the <b>marine</b> <b>dredging</b> (control sites). SSTs around collection time ranged 0. 6 – 0. 9 °C over the 40 -year monthly mean. All specimens collected at project sites exhibited histopathological {{evidence of}} mild to moderate sedimentation stress including changes in size and number of mucocytes in epidermis and gastrodermis, attenuation of the epidermal and gastrodermal tissues, presence of cellular debris, and changes in number of zooxanthellae. These findings corroborate results of laboratory-based, sand-application experiments. In addition to the above-noted changes, one specimen exhibited multiple lesions consisting of unusual gastrodermal detachment with infiltration of amoebocytes into the adjacent mesoglea. Tissues surrounding detachment injuries exhibited marked to severe cellular changes. Accumulations of amoebocytes at lesion sites are seldom observed in wild corals. This response may be part of an organized reaction to injury and infection, as has been documented in sea anemones and gorgonians; however, further research is needed on the nature and role(s) of the scleractinian amoebocytes...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the harbour activities, big amount of sediments are dredged every year. The traditional solution such as dumping the dredged sediments to the sea/river since its regulated in Europe, is not an option anymore. Therefore the beneficial reuse of polluted <b>marine</b> <b>dredged</b> sediments is urgently needed to realize. This study focused on reuse the dredged sediment in road construction. The main objective of this research is to enhance the physical, mechanical and chemical characteristics of the mix by incorporating binders sediments to fulfil the criteria in their use as material in road construction. The results show that the treatment by hydraulics binders and silica fume could satisfy the needed mechanical characteristics. The main reason of Silica Fume addition is its capability to trap the pollutants so that the pollutants could not escape from the matrix and pollute the environment. After the geotechnical study in laboratory results show as expected, then the study to identify the chemical characteristic realized. To evaluate the environmental impacts of the use material, leaching test are performed. The leaching test was performed to verify the predicted release of pollutants based on total dissolution.

40|$|Coastal erosion is {{a global}} problem and a major concern for European Union Member States. In the UK, <b>marine</b> {{aggregate}} <b>dredging</b> {{is considered by many}} to be responsible for coastal loss and campaigns based on the ‘precautionary principle’ have been mounted to halt extraction. Two South Wales, UK coastal areas, where critical beach loss has been associated with dredging activities, were monitored to assess morphological change. In five years of beach monitoring along the Penarth coastline (September 1997 to September 2002) and six years monitoring Port Eynon and Horton beaches (January 2001 to October 2007), no qualitative or quantitative causal link was found between <b>marine</b> aggregate <b>dredging</b> and beach erosion. Conversely, many qualitative and quantitative relationships were established between beach erosion and forcing agents such as water level, wind and waves. Results from Port Eynon and Horton showed significant temporal variations in beach level and on-shore/offshore sediment movement was seen as significant in beach formation processes. At Penarth, changing wind direction and increased easterly storms were most significant. Furthermore, there were indications of recognised causes of coastal erosion such as increased water levels, storms and anthropogenic construction. Therefore, morphological changes on a relatively short timescale can be clearly attributed to influences other than <b>marine</b> aggregate <b>dredging.</b> Potential future work includes regular monitoring and analysis of shoreline changes in areas adjacent to dredging sites together with concurrent bathymetric surveys.
