5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E
5|$|Various {{segments}} of <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> {{scattered around the}} galleon, which will form a complete view of the game's overworld once all the segments are picked up. Other scattered items in the game include keys for locked doors, gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery, the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player's score.|$|E
30|$|It {{follows from}} the above {{definitions}} that a nonexpansive <b>mapping</b> <b>is</b> quasi-nonexpansive and that an asymptotically nonexpansive <b>mapping</b> <b>is</b> asymptotically quasi-nonexpansive. Moreover, an asymptotically nonexpansive <b>mapping</b> <b>is</b> uniformly L-Lipschitzian. However, the converse of these statements is not true, in general.|$|R

5|$|A unique {{collection}} of maps {{assembled in the}} early 1570s, {{many of which are}} assembled from portions of Mercator's earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps an atlas.|$|E
5|$|In a {{first for}} the series, Days of Ruin {{includes}} online multiplayer over Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, {{as well as a}} feature for players to share their own custom map designs and download maps made by others (custom maps and sharing custom maps is a feature present in all Advance Wars games). Over 150 premade <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> included in the game for use in local multiplayer, and designed for two, three, and four-player matches. Multiplayer games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is their turn. It is also possible to set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, Perfect Dark features a multiplayer mode. With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a pre-set time to the Counter Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, {{with the use of the}} optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may also use the Game Boy Printer to print out character profiles.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to improve}} a theorem of Janos Kollar. For a given Complex {{projective}} threefold X of general type, suppose the plurigenus p_k(X) > 2, Kollar {{proved that the}} (11 k+ 5) -canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> birational. Here we show that either the (7 k+ 3) -canonical map or the (7 k+ 5) -canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> birational and that the m-canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> stably birational for m> 13 k+ 6. If P_k(X) > 3, then the m-canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> stably birational for m> 10 k+ 8. In particular, the 12 -canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> birational when p_g(X) > 2 and the 11 -canonical <b>map</b> <b>is</b> birational when p_g(X) > 3.

5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E

5|$|The {{beaches of}} Normandy are still known by their {{invasion}} code names. Significant places have plaques, memorials, or small museums, and guide books and <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> available. Some of the German strong points remain preserved; Pointe du Hoc {{in particular is}} little changed from 1944. The remains of Mulberry harbour B still sits in the sea at Arromanches. Several large cemeteries in the area serve as the final resting place {{for many of the}} Allied and German soldiers killed in the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|Weather <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> used {{to display}} {{information}} quickly showing {{the analysis of}} various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|Rare {{released}} a multiplayer map pack, called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack One, to the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 7, 2006. It contains the demo's new multiplayer map {{as well as}} three other new maps {{to add to the}} game's original six. Unlike the game's default maps, the new maps only have one variant instead of two. On October 31, 2006, Rare announced that a special platinum edition of Perfect Dark Zero would be released, and would include the first map pack and two additional maps. The two new maps were later released for free in a pack called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack Two. These <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> updated versions of two maps from the original Perfect Dark: Felicity and Ruins. The pack was released on November 1, 2006 for Gold Members and on November 8, 2006 for Silver Members.|$|E
5|$|The atlas {{includes}} further 28 maps: 16 of Britain, 4 of Denmark and {{one each}} of the polar regions, Iceland, Norway with Sweden, Prussia, Livonia, Russia, Lithuania, Transylvania and Crimea. This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who {{had spent much of}} his working life in London. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> in a variety of projections.|$|E
