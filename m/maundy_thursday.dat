5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday,</b> 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E

25|$|Given these {{assumptions}} {{he argues that}} the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> would be an anachronism. The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.|$|E
25|$|Lilleshall was audited {{under the}} Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, preparatory to the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of the {{following}} year. The gross income {{was found to be}} £324 0s. 10d., according to the Victoria County History: two pounds more according to Eyton. The high running costs brought this down to a net income of only £232 16s. 6d. – just above the £200 threshold set by the act. There were many expenses, including 40s. to the poor on <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> and £4 on the Nativity of Mary (8 September) – both original bequests of Philip de Belmeis. However, lay officials, some very wealthy, drew large salaries: George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury was paid £2 13s. 4d. to act as steward, Thomas Bromley £2 as auditor and Nicholas Cockerell a very substantial £6 13s. 4d. As receiver general. Officers at nearby Wombridge Priory, another Augustinian house, were fewer much less richly rewarded.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tradition}} of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities. These {{grew out of}} the earlier revels and had become evident by the 15th century in places like Rome, and Venice, where they developed as entertainments to enliven towns and cities. Thus the <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> carnival in St Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of 'commedia dell'arte' inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole 'season' from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he was ugly enough not to need a mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the C 18th heyday were revived. It appears other cities in central Europe were influenced by the Venetian model.|$|E
25|$|The Easter (or Paschal) Triduum {{consists}} of three liturgies that are each practiced once per year in any Catholic parish or community. The Holy (or <b>Maundy)</b> <b>Thursday</b> evening Mass of the Lord's Supper {{is the first of}} these liturgies. The Triduum continues with the liturgy of Good Friday, the only day of the year on which Mass is not celebrated. The Triduum culminates with the celebration of Jesus' resurrection, the most solemn observance of which is the Easter Vigil. The specific liturgy of the Easter Vigil is a Mass celebrated only during the Saturday evening preceding Easter Sunday and contains ritual elements not performed at any other point in the liturgical year. Masses celebrated on Easter Sunday also celebrate the Resurrection but are closer in structure to other Masses than is the Easter Vigil. These days recall Jesus' last supper with his disciples, his passion, death on the cross, his burial, and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The season of Eastertide follows the Triduum and climaxes on Pentecost, recalling the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples in the upper room.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} rivalry between St Helens and Wigan; the local derby between the two clubs has been {{traditionally}} regarded as the biggest in British rugby league, {{as well as one}} of the oldest in world rugby league. Both being founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union, the derby has been played since 1895, making it amongst the most historical derbys in both British and global rugby league. Remarkably, the first encounter between the fierce rivals ended in a 0—0 draw at Knowsley Road, The games were traditionally played on Boxing Day, however were moved to Good Friday, during the busy Easter period in rugby league. More recently, the game was even played on <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> in Super League. In all league encounters between the two since 1895, there have been 235 games, with Wigan having won nearly double the amount of games that St Helens have. Saints winning 83, drawing 11 and losing 141. All competitive games, i.e. cup and league games combined, show that in the 366 games played, St Helens have won 141, there have been 19 draws and Wigan have won 206. They too have contested no fewer than 6 Challenge Cup Finals, and have met in three Super League Grand Finals; St Helens winning 29-16 in 2000, with Wigan initially gaining revenge in 2010, with a 22-10 win, before Saints claimed the 2014 Super League Grand Final by a score of 14-6, taking a 2-1 lead in their Super League Grand Final head-to-heads. Wigan and St Helens have also met in 4 Premiership Finals, Wigan winning 3, St Helens once, 3 Lancashire County Cup Finals, St Helens winning two, Wigan one, and one Floodlit Trophy Final in 1968, Wigan winning 7—4. The two have traditionally met each other in the Magic Weekend too. The two teams have a pretty even record, winning two (at Millennium Stadium in 2007 and 2008) and losing two (at Murrayfield in 2009 and Etihad Stadium in 2012), with one draw (at Millennium Stadium in 2011) in five ties. St Helens greatest winning margin and the highest game score between the two in competitive football was a 75—0 win in a 2005 Challenge Cup Round 6 game.

500|$|The {{battle at}} Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, {{due largely to}} the dense fog and terrible weather that {{hampered}} his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements {{did not seem to}} hamper Charles. [...] The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gründonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday),</b> the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers huddled in their cellars, and hoped for the best and gasping for breath as the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000or so soldiers who died in the battle.|$|E
500|$|By 1363 the British monarch {{performed}} the pedilavium and also gave gifts: [...] that year, fifty-year-old Edward III gave fifty pence {{to each of}} fifty poor men.

The ceremony was not always performed on Maundy Thursday; it could be postponed a day to Good Friday by royal command, as it was in 1510. [...] Nobles could hold their own Maundy distributions, as did Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland in the early 16th century, according to a contemporary record: [...] "My Lord useth and accustomyth yerly uppon the said <b>Maundy</b> <b>Thursday</b> when his Lordshipe is at home to gyf yerly as manny Pursses of Lether... with as manny Penys in every purse to as many poore men as his Lordshipe is Yeres of Aige and one for the Yere of my Lords Aige to come." ...|$|E

500|$|The major {{purpose for}} the silver penny in the 18th century was as Maundy money. Most silver pennies after 1727 were likely used {{for that purpose}} or for other royal largesse; the mintages were enough to provide for this, but not enough for general circulation. [...] In some years, the Maundy money may have been {{composed}} entirely of pennies, though there are accounts of the twopence, threepence, and groat being used as well. At times, there were gaps in the dating as enough for several years was struck at once, to be held against need. There were enough silver pennies in circulation that Maundy recipients could spend their gifts. By 1727, the price of silver guaranteed that pennies were struck at a loss. [...] When other regal coins began use of a bust showing George II as an older man in 1740–1743, the penny remained unaltered. Brian Robinson, in his book on the Royal Maundy, suggested that a new bust for a coin issued only in small quantities {{would not have been}} worth the 12 weeks' work it would have taken a Mint engraver to create new dies. In any event, between 1727 and 1816, silver cost too much for there to be much coinage of it. George II's pennies had a left-facing bust of him and the inscription GEORGIVS II DEI GRATIA continuing onto the other side with MAG BRI FR ET HIB REX and the date around the crowned [...] "I". Pennies were minted in 1729, 1731, 1732, 1735, 1737, 1739, 1740, 1743, 1746, 1750 and 17521760.
