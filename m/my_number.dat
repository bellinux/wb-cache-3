500|$|The {{style of}} music S Club 7 {{normally}} falls under is pop, or more specifically bubblegum pop, {{as well as}} manufactured pop. This is certainly the case for their first album, S Club where simple lyrics, three-chord structures and danceable beats define it so. Their first two singles saw vocals shared equally amongst the seven members of the group, {{and it was not}} until their third single, [...] "Two in a Million" [...] that O'Meara became known as their lead vocalist. Although the band were to progressively change their style over the four years they were together, even their first album had many tracks atypical of the pop genre: [...] "You're <b>My</b> <b>Number</b> One" [...] ,"Love Train" [...] and [...] "Everybody Wants Ya" [...] were motown driven whereas [...] "Viva La Fiesta" [...] and [...] "It's A Feel Good Thing", were both [...] "bouncy, salsa-driven Latino songs".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the year, the group enjoyed more success in the charts after their second single, [...] "S Club Party", entered the UK charts at number-two and went {{straight}} to number-one in New Zealand. Their third single was a double A-side and featured the ballad, co-written by Cathy Dennis, [...] "Two in a Million" [...] and retro-styled, up-tempo [...] "You're <b>My</b> <b>Number</b> One". The former was the first single where O'Meara took leads vocals, setting the standard for future S Club 7 releases; the single also reached number-two in the UK charts. Following the success of their television show and released singles, the group released their debut album S Club in October 1999. The album quickly rose to number-two in the UK charts, and then became certified Double Platinum. The album consisted of a variety of styles including motown and salsa tracks.|$|E

Tom wears a goofy orange hat at the bar, which he calls [...] "peacocking", or {{standing}} out in a public setting like a peacock. The two talk to women at the bar, but Mark finds them boring and he leaves Tom alone. Ron enjoys the banquet's bacon-wrapped shrimp, [...] "my number one favorite food, wrapped around <b>my</b> <b>number</b> three favorite food". Leslie confronts Jeanine about her husband's DUI, but when Jeanine grows angry, Leslie is unable to go through with the blackmail; Jeanine splashes water in Leslie's face, and she leaves ashamed. Leslie visits Ann and apologizes, and Ann acknowledges Leslie was partially right about Andy. The two hug and Andy gets angry because he thought Leslie was [...] "a dude" [...] due to her haircut. Mark comes back to the banquet hall to find Ann and Leslie, but is disappointed to see the banquet is over.|$|E

500|$|Hordern was {{appearing}} {{in three to}} four films a year by 1953, a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in The Spanish Gardener for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside Dirk Bogarde, Cyril Cusack, and Bernard Lee. The New York Times called Hordern's role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande [...] "an unsympathetic assignment", but thought the actor did [...] "quite well" [...] in his portrayal. [...] By the mid-1950s Hordern's name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as Demosthenes in Alexander the Great, and Commander Lindsay in The Night <b>My</b> <b>Number</b> Came Up. He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama No Time for Tears, and the thriller Windom's Way. The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up {{a large part of}} people's lives; [...] "whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy", everybody, according to the actor, had a story to tell and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including The Man Who Never Was, Pacific Destiny, The Baby and the Battleship, all in 1956, and I Was Monty's Double two years later.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{opens with}} [...] "Call Me Maybe", an upbeat track that draws {{influences}} from dance-pop and R. The clever lyrics {{of the song}} describes the [...] "infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight," [...] as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre-chorus, the singer states, [...] "Ripped jeans, skin was showing/Hot night, wind was blowing/Where you think you’re going, baby?" [...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy, But here's <b>my</b> <b>number,</b> So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 13, 2017 {{edition of}} The Juggalo Show with Jumpsteady, Violent J, and Kevin Gill, {{it was said}} by Violent J that {{recently}} he has pushed his solo album Karma Forest back because he has [...] "been consumed with the entity that is the next Joker Card" [...] also saying [...] "I am finding out more about it everyday {{and it may be}} the best entity in the Dark Carnival yet". He stated [...] "The only thing that I can say about it is Red Fred, Red Fred". He also said the future plans as of now are, they are going to go on The Parental Advisory Tour with 2 Live Crew, Onyx, Geto Boys and they were trying to also get Necro throughout the month of June leading up to the Gathering of the Juggalos. Then after the GOTJ, Shaggy 2 Dope will embark on the F.T.F.O.M.F. Tour to promote his third solo album F.T.F.O.M.F. While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will start putting the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life". He also stated that ICP will also go on a 20th Anniversary: The Great Milenko Tour, after the Juggalo March On Washington (September 16 – 17, 2017) which will lead up to their 24th Annual Hallowicked Show, and then they will tour England mid to late November (13–20). In late April/early May Necro announced that he will not take part in the Juggalo March On Washington nor would he take part in The Parental Advisory Tour stating in part [...] "It's all good between us, just business. They were wanting me to tour for a month basically for free". On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now <b>my</b> <b>number</b> 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show. [...] "Fearless Fred Fury" [...] was revealed as the name of the next Joker Card at their Hallowicked show.|$|E

2500|$|Due to his {{constant}} visibility next to Method Man, and his tendency to wear Wu-Tang related clothing on stage, some fans have confused Redman for being {{more than just}} an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2001, a charitable trust was set up in Brown's name. The Dennis Emanuel Brown Trust works to educate youngsters, maintain and advance the memory of Dennis Brown, and help to provide youngsters with musical instruments. The trust awards the Dennis Emanuel Brown (DEB) bursary for educational achievement each year to students between the ages of 10 and 12 years. In 2005, George Nooks, who had worked with Brown in the mid-1970s in his deejay guise as Prince Mohamed, released an album of Brown covers, George Nooks Sings Dennis Brown: The Voice Lives On, with Nooks stating: [...] "I was always inspired by his talent and I used to sing like him. Dennis had a large influence on me. To me he was the greatest. He was <b>my</b> <b>number</b> one singer." [...] In the same year, Gregory Isaacs paid a similar tribute with the album Gregory Isaacs Sings Dennis Brown. In February 2007, a series of events were staged in Jamaica in celebration of the lives of both Brown and Marley (both would have had birthdays that month). In 2008, the Dennis Brown Trust announced a new internet radio station, dedicated solely to the music of Dennis Brown, and in the same month a tribute concert was staged by the Jamaican Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA) featuring Dwight Pinkney, Derrick Harriott, Sugar Minott, George Nooks, and John Holt.|$|E

2500|$|A prolifically {{successful}} composer for the cinema, Malcolm Arnold {{is credited}} with having written over a hundred film scores for features and documentaries between 1947 and 1969. In 1957, Arnold won an Academy Award for the music to David Lean's epic film The Bridge on the River Kwai. His two other collaborations with David Lean were The Sound Barrier (1952) and Hobson's Choice (1954), {{both of which were}} also resoundingly successful. The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) won Arnold an Ivor Novello Award. [...] Also during the 1950s — an especially prolific period for Arnold — he provided a series of successful scores for major British and American feature films, such as [...] The Captain's Paradise (1953), The Sea Shall Not Have Them (1954), The Night <b>My</b> <b>Number</b> Came Up (1955), The Constant Husband (1955), I Am a Camera (1955), 1984 (1956), Trapeze (1956), A Hill in Korea (1956), Dunkirk (1958), The Key (1958) and The Roots of Heaven (1958). He also wrote the music for the entire series of St Trinian's films, including The Belles of St Trinian's (1954), which was a particular favourite with the composer.

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of <b>my</b> <b>number</b> 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
