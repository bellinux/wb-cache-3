In both regions, Allounit A extends from the seafloor downward to aV 12 ^ 11 -ka sequence boundary, which is a major shelf-crossing unconformity in water depths less thanV 100 ^ 110 m. In deep basins of the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea,</b> the lower part of Allounit A, designated Subunit A 2, is a laminated sapropel, M 1. On the shelf, Subunit A 2 consists of backstepping delta lobes and early-transgressive barrier islands and sand sheets. Allounit B has only been recovered in <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> cores collected at water depths greater than V 90 m, and represents basinal or prodeltaic deposition during the 23 ^ 12 -ka late Pleistocene lowstand.

At this depth interval, high P- and S-wave velocity values are observed beneath Armutlu Peninsula, Yalova, Gazikoy, and Tekirdağ. High-velocity values in the Sakarya zone are observed.

40|$|During {{the last}} {{glaciation}} the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> was {{isolated from the}} Mediterranean Sea because global sea level was below {{the depth of the}} Dardanelles sill. Prior to the postglacial reconnection to the Mediterranean Sea (~ 14. 7 cal kyr BP), the surface waters of the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> were brackish (<b>Marmara</b> Lake). Freshening of a previously saline <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> could have happened via spill-out of brackish to fresh water from the surface water of the Black Sea through the Bosphorus Strait. This hypothesis has not been tested against alternative possibilities (salt flushing by river run-off and precipitation). Here we use the dissolved Cl- and stable isotope composition (δO 18 and δD) of <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> sediment pore water to estimate the salinity and stable isotope composition of Marmara Lake bottom water and to evaluate possible freshening scenarios. We use a transport model to simulate pore water Cl-, δO 18 and δD in <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> sediments in the past 130 kyr, which includes the last interglacial (130 - 75 cal kyr BP), the last glacial (75 - 14 cal kyr BP) and the current postglacial period. Our results show that the bottom waters of the Marmara Lake were brackish (~ 4 ‰ salinity) and isotopically depleted (δO 18 ~- 10. 2 ‰ and δD~- 70 ‰, respectively) compared to modern seawater. Their salinity and stable isotope ratios show that they are a mixture of Mediterranean waters and Danube-like waters implying that the freshening took place via spill-out of freshwater through the Bosphorus. Our modelling approach indicates that the transit of fresh water from glacial Eurasia to the Mediterranean via the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> started at least 50 cal kyr BP, was continuous throughout most of the last glaciation and persisted up to the post glacial reconnection to the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles sill (14. 7 cal kyr BP).

In this paper, simple two-dimensional magnetic and gravity models are constructed utilizing parameters such as the density contrast and susceptibilities obtained from a borehole, seismic sections and field susceptibility measurements, respectively. The gravity model shows the existence of horst-like structures, as suggested previously. The top of the magnetic bodies in the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> {{is close to the}} sea bottom. In general, these magnetic bodies are fault-related. The gravity model complies with the seismic base map, which was constructed previously. The magnetic anomalies of anomalous regions of the Cinarcik and Western Basins demonstrate slight anticlockwise block rotations, while large anticlockwise block rotation is observed in the eastern extremity of the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea.</b> Geophysical data and modeling results suggest that the origin and evaluation of the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> began with the possibility of emplacement of horst-like structures in the Central Ridge during the Palaeozoic or earlier followed by block rotations and intrusion of the magnetic material into the upper crust with sediment deposition and faulting.

Stratigraphic analysis provides evidence for creep-like deformation in <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> sediments, however, no detailed quantitative geophysical analysis has been conducted to determine whether elevated fluid pressures exist in the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> sediments today, or if these sediments are potentially near-critically stressed. If fluid pressures are high and the sediments are close to failure, only minor ground accelerations from earthquakes along the active Northern Anatolian Fault might trigger failure. For this study, I use high resolution multichannel 2 D seismic data collected in the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> to estimate indirectly P-wave and S-wave velocities that I then use to detect both possible gas accumulations and zones of high pore pressure. Specifically, I integrate interval P-wave velocities (using Dix equation), rock physics models, and Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) methods to estimate Vs velocities. With Vp and Vs constrained, I then estimate where elevated fluid pressures in shallow (3 ̆c 500 3 ̆embsf) sediment might exist in sediments on the southern margin of the <b>Marmara</b> <b>Sea</b> where pressure-driven creep-like deformation is hypothesized. I first characterize using forward models what normal versus overpressured AVO and Vp/Vs response should be like in the environment. Then, I compare model predictions with observations in a zone where creep-like deformation exists. The final product provides evidence for both if and where elevated pore pressure likely exists along the zone of noted sediment creep.
