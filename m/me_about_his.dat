[...] In the introduction to his novel Something Fresh, Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was [...] "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man. [...] He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'." [...] Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the Wykehamist schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College. Rupert D'Oyly Carte was [...] "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn." [...] Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.|$|E

In the {{rational}} world that Bjørn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one...But the real world is messier, more unpredictable - and more impatient." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show also gained {{widespread}} {{attention with}} its third season, , which aired in 1994, and depicted {{the conflict between}} David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey, a bicycle messenger criticized for his poor personal hygiene, and his roommates, most notably AIDS activist Pedro Zamora. As the show increased in popularity, Zamora’s life as someone living with AIDS gained considerable notice, garnering widespread media attention. Zamora {{was one of the}} first openly gay men with AIDS to be portrayed in popular media, and after his death on November 11, 1994 (mere hours after the final episode of his season aired), he was lauded by then-President Bill Clinton. Zamora’s friend and roommate during the show, Judd Winick, went on to become a successful comic book writer, and wrote the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel Pedro and <b>Me,</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> friendship with Zamora, as well as high-profile and controversial storylines in mainstream superhero comics that featured gay and AIDS-related themes. Zamora's conflicts with Rainey were not only considered emotional high points for that season, but are credited with making The Real World a hit show, and with proving that the infant [...] "reality" [...] television format was one that could bring considerable ratings to a network. By July 1995, the series surpassed Beavis and Butt-head as the network's top-rated show during the fourth season, [...]|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{was quite}} terrifying this morning, when we arrived,' said I; 'he struck attitudes {{and called it}} his beloved country, and wanted to linger in the cold morning and tell <b>me</b> anecdotes <b>about</b> <b>his</b> childhood.' ...|$|R

60|$|So naturally, when Rocky Todd told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> aunt, I didn't hesitate. Jeeves {{was in on}} {{the thing}} from the start.|$|E

6000|$|... [Taking his hand.] Good-bye, John. You're {{not angry}} with me because I was horrid.... I'm glad you told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> wife. Now I shall know what to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was there {{anything}} disturbing {{in the paper}} Herbert gave me for you? He doesn't tell <b>me</b> much <b>about</b> <b>his</b> business, but I gathered that he was vexed about some shares he bought on your account. I should be sorry if they have gone down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{talk about}} it, my boy, {{just as if}} a father {{were the same as}} anybody else. If I had a father with a lot of money, by George he should knock <b>me</b> <b>about</b> with <b>his</b> stick if he liked, and I would be just the same the next day." ...|$|R

60|$|The Duke stood a {{few paces}} from me, looking out of the window.

60|$|It is {{impossible}} to endure, any longer, my present state of suspense. Oscar must, and shall, satisfy <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Madame Pratolungo--with <b>his</b> own lips. I shall write to him by this post, and insist on his coming to Ramsgate.|$|R
60|$|LADY BASILDON. [Looking round {{through her}} lorgnette.] I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could {{possibly}} call a serious purpose. The {{man who took}} me in to dinner talked to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> wife the whole time.|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{father never}} {{in his life}} said {{anything}} to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own money affairs, though he says {{a great deal about}} mine. No man ever was closer than my father. But I believe that he could afford almost anything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They have {{certainly}} made <b>me</b> all doubtful <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character. As Ginevra speaks, {{they do not}} carry with them the sound of unmixed truth: I believe she exaggerates--perhaps invents--but I {{want to know how}} far." ...|$|R
60|$|I made my {{way there}} and took up the {{receiver}} without any special interest. Ralph was fidgety these days, and I {{had no doubt that}} he had something to say to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the shooting. <b>His</b> first words, however, riveted my attention.|$|R
