There is controversy over whether childhood television viewing causes attention problems. The findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have been <b>mixed.</b> To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> no longitudinal studies have assessed the impact of children’s television viewing on attention problems in adolescence. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess this association. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING. Study members were a general population birth co-hort of 1037 participants (502 female) born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between April 1972 and March 1973. Parental estimates of children’s television-viewing time were obtained at ages 5, 7, 9, and 11 years. Self-, parent-, and teacher-reported attention problems in adolescence were obtained at ages 13 and 15 years. RESULTS. The mean of hours of television viewing during childhood was associated with symptoms of attention problems in adolescence. These associations remained significant after controlling for gender, attention problems in early childhood...|$|R
40|$|A {{swirling}} jet with a swirl number of S = 0. 12 is excited by plane acoustic waves at various Strouhal numbers (St = fD/U sub alpha). The maximum forcing amplitude of excitation was at 6. 88 {{percent of the}} time-mean axial velocity at a Strouhal number of St = 0. 39. The maximum time-mean tangential and axial velocities at the nozzle exit were 18 and 84 m/sec respectively. It was observed that the {{swirling jet}} was excitable by plane acoustic waves and the preferred Strouhal number based on the nozzle diameter and exit axial velocity of the jet was about 0. 39. As a result of excitation at this frequency, the time-mean axial velocity decayed faster along the jet centerline, reaching about 89 percent of its unexcited value at x/D = 9. Also the half velocity radius and momentum thickness, at 7 nozzle diameters downstream, increased by 13. 2 and 5. 8 percent respectively, indicating more jet spread and enhanced <b>mixing.</b> To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{this is the first}} reported experimental data indicating any mixing enhancement of swirling jets by acoustic excitation...|$|R

Our approach is sampling via Markov chain, {{but it is}} NOT a simulation of behavior of customers in queueing networks. We propose two of new ergodic Markov chains {{both of which have}} a unique stationary distribution that is the product form solution of closed Jackson networks. One of them is for approximate sampling, and we show it <b>mixes</b> rapidly. To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> this is the first approximate polynomial-time sampler for closed Jackson networks with multiple servers. The other is for perfect sampling based on monotone CFTP (coupling from the past) algorithm proposed by Propp and Wilson,and we show the monotonicity of the chain. ...|$|R

The mean of hours of television viewing during childhood was associated with symptoms of attention problems in adolescence. These associations remained significant after controlling for gender, attention problems in early childhood, cognitive ability at 5 years of age, and childhood socioeconomic status. This association was also independent of adolescent television viewing. CONCLUSIONS. Childhood television viewing was associated with attention problems in adolescence, independent of early attention problems and other confounders. These results support the hypothesis that childhood television viewing may contribute to the development of attention problems and suggest that the effects may be long-lasting...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{or reduced}} {{velocity}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) {{has been associated}} with type I Chiari malformation (CMI). Thus, quantification of hydrodynamic parameters that describe the CSF dynamics could help assess disease severity and surgical outcome. In this study, we describe the methodology to quantify CSF hydrodynamic parameters near the CVJ and upper cervical spine utilizing subject-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based on in vivo MRI measurements of flow and geometry. Hydrodynamic parameters were computed for a healthy subject and two CMI patients both pre- and post-decompression surgery to determine the differences between cases. For the first time, we present the methods to quantify longitudinal impedance (LI) to CSF motion, a subject-specific hydrodynamic parameter that may have value to help quantify the CSF flow blockage severity in CMI. In addition, the following hydrodynamic parameters were quantified for each case: maximum velocity in systole and diastole, Reynolds and Womersley number, and peak pressure drop during the CSF cardiac flow cycle. The following geometric parameters were quantified: cross-sectional area and hydraulic diameter of the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). The mean values of the geometric parameters increased post-surgically for the CMI models, but remained smaller than the healthy volunteer. All hydrodynamic parameters, except pressure drop, decreased post-surgically for the CMI patients, but remained greater than in the healthy case. Peak pressure drop alterations were <b>mixed.</b> To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> this study represents the first subject...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Previous {{findings}} regarding a possible association between beta-blocker use and depression are <b>mixed.</b> To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{there have been}} no studies investigating the association of beta-blockers with depression in primary care hypertension patients without previous myocardial infarction. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relation between lipophilic beta-blocker use and depression in elderly primary care patients with hypertension. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in primary care practices located in the South of The Netherlands. Primary care hypertension patients without previous myocardial infarction or heart failure (n= 573), aged between 60 and 85 years (mean age= 70 ± 6. 6), were included. All patients underwent a structured interview that included a self-report questionnaire to assess depression (PHQ- 9), which was divided in four groups (PHQ- 9 score of 0, 1 – 3, 4 – 8, 9 or higher). Results: A PHQ- 9 score of 0 was more prevalent in non-beta-blocker users versus lipophilic beta-blocker users (46 % versus 35 %), a PHQ- 9 score of 4 – 8 was less prevalent in non-beta-blocker users as compared with lipophilic beta-blocker users (14 % versus 25 %). A chi-squared test showed that lipophilic beta-blocker users as compared to non-beta-blockers users were more likely to be in a higher depression category. Ordinal regression showed a significant relationship between use of lipophilic beta-blockers and depression (OR= 1. 60, 95 % CI= 1. 08 – 2. 36) when adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions: Our findings show that primary care hypertension patients who use a lipophilic beta-blocker are more likely to have higher depression scores than those who do not use a lipophilic beta-blocker...|$|R
