50|$|The {{technique}} was developed at EMI/Abbey Road Studios {{in the late}} 1950s, by EMI engineer Gwynne Stock. It involved delaying the recorded (dry) signal, sending it into the studio's echo chamber using a tape machine. The dry signal (without delay) was also sent to the chamber via the <b>tape</b> <b>machine's</b> <b>replay</b> head. The resulting sound {{was picked up by}} two condenser microphones. These microphones then fed the wet signal back to the recording console. The amount of feedback could be controlled allowing multiple delays to be sent to the reverb chamber, which could lengthen the effect's decay time.|$|R
50|$|The Birotron (pronounced by-ro-tron) is a <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> {{keyboard}} {{conceived by}} American musician and inventor Dave Biro of Yalesville, Connecticut, US, {{and funded by}} English keyboardist Rick Wakeman, Campbell Soup Company-Pepperidge Farm Foods in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical, {{polyphonic}} <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboard {{originally developed}} and built in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It {{evolved from a}} similar instrument, the Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more effectively. The instrument works by pulling a section of magnetic tape across a head. Different portions of the tape can be played to access different sounds.|$|R
5000|$|The mellotron is an electro-mechanical, {{polyphonic}} <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboard {{that used}} {{a bank of}} parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips.

50|$|Wakeman {{recorded}} the next Yes album, Tormato, in early 1978. He is reputed {{to have given}} the album its name by throwing a tomato at a showing of the art used for the album's cover. In 1978 Wakeman, along with Mick Jagger, Peter Frampton, and Paul Simon, invested {{in the formation of}} the Philadelphia Fury, an American soccer team that disbanded in 1980. Wakeman also funded the development of the Birotron, a <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboard that used 8-track tape cartridges, developed by Dave Biro.|$|R

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{automate}} the present manual methods of analysing long term (24 hour) recorded Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at high speed (60 times the recorded speed). An algorithm has been developed which groups the recorded heart beats into one of up to six families depending on its shape and also into 'early/on time/late' depending on the time of occurrence of a beat with respect to the precedding beats. The algorithm was implemented on a general purpose mini-computer and supplied with data from the ECG <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> unit. A total of 4608 beats so analysed were manually checked and found to be correct. The construction of a stand-alone microprocessor implementation of the algorithm is proposed and possible extensions to the algorithm are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Prior to {{computer}} memory-based samplers, musicians used <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron {{was the most}} notable model, used {{by a number of}} groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical. Bruce Haack built a digital sampler which he demonstrated on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1967. The home made synthesizer device included a built-in sampler which recorded, stored, played back and looped sounds controlled by switches, light sensors and human skin contact.|$|R

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{three distinct}} {{versions of the}} song. After Lennon played the song for the other Beatles on his acoustic guitar, the band recorded the first take.

2500|$|Tormato was {{released}} in September 1978 {{at the height of}} punk rock in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes. Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the Birotron, a <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboard, and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the RIAA. Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's 1978–1979 tour was a commercial success.

40|$|A {{castellated}} magnetoresistive {{structure has}} been fabricated and evaluated for its application as a multi-track <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> head. It {{has a higher}} field sensitivity and is less susceptible {{to the effect of}} demagnetizing fields at its edges than a conventional 'straight' element magnetoresistor. The inherently noisy magnetoresitive response attributed to its multi-domain structure has been found to reduce substantially as its film thickness is decreased below 250 Å. The unshielded castellated structure is simple to fabricate and offers an integral tape flux guiding system. Initial simple tape tests show that its replay performance compares favourably with the Philips DCC yoke-type MR replay head. A multi-track single turn thin-film inductive write head has been fabricated and tested. The head is built from a sandwich of two substrates each having an array of thin-film permalloy poles. The lower pole array is constructed with the patterned winding and gap layers, and the upper pole array with the front and rear permalloy yoke layers. The poles are optically aligned and the substrates glued together to complete the write structure...|$|R
50|$|Whereas loops {{are usually}} a phrase {{played on a}} musical instrument, this type of sample is usually a single note. Music {{workstations}} and samplers use samples of musical instruments {{as the basis of}} their own sounds, and are capable of playing a sample back at any pitch. Many modern synthesizers and drum machines also use samples as the basis of their sounds. (See sample-based synthesis for more information.) Most such samples are created in professional recording studios using world-class instruments played by accomplished musicians. These are usually developed by the manufacturer of the instrument or by a subcontractor who specializes in creating such samples. There are businesses and individuals who create libraries of samples of musical instruments. Of course, a sampler allows anyone to create such samples. Possibly the earliest equipment used to sample recorded instrument sounds are the Chamberlin, which was developed in the 1940s, and its better-known cousin, the Mellotron, marketed in England in the 1960s. Both are <b>tape</b> <b>replay</b> keyboards, in which each key pressed triggers a prerecorded tape recording of a single note.|$|R

40|$|Holography {{has been}} used {{successfully}} in combination with conventional optics {{for the first time}} in a large cryogenic bubble chamber, the 15 -Foot Bubble Chamber at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), during a physics run in a high-energy neutrino beam. The innovative system combined the reference beam with the object beam, irradiating a conical volume of ~ 1. 5 m/sup 3 /. Bubble tracks from neutrino interactions with a width of ~ 120 mu m have been recorded with good contrast. The ratio of intensities of the object light to the reference light striking the film is called the beam branching ratio (BBR). We obtained in our experiment an exceedingly small minimum-observable ratio of BBR=(0. 54 / 0. 21) * 10 /sup - 7 /. The technology has the potential for a wide range of applications. This paper describes the various difficulties in achieving the success. It required the development of laser pulse stretching via enhanced closed loop control with slow Q-switching, to overcome excessive heating of the cryogenic liquid by the powerful laser beam. A sophisticated system of light-absorbing baffles had to be installed to avoid stray light reaching the holographic film. Optical decoupling of classical and holographic illumination systems was required. Real and virtual image <b>replay</b> <b>machines</b> for holograms were built, tailored to our illumination technique. (15 refs) ...|$|R

40|$|Recording and replaying the {{execution}} of smartphone apps is useful {{in a variety of}} contexts, from reproducing bugs to profiling and testing. Achieving effective record-and-replay is a balancing act between accuracy and overhead. On smartphones, the act is particularly complicated, be-cause smartphone apps receive a high-bandwidth stream of input (e. g., network, GPS, camera, microphone, touch-screen) and concurrency events, but the stream has to be recorded and replayed with minimal overhead, to avoid in-terfering with app execution. Prior record-and-replay ap-proaches have focused on <b>replaying</b> <b>machine</b> instructions or system calls, which is not a good fit on smartphones. We pro-pose a novel, stream-oriented record-and-replay approach which achieves high-accuracy and low-overhead by aiming at a sweet spot: recording and replaying sensor and net-work input, event schedules, and inter-app communication via intents. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we have constructed a tool named VALERA that supports record-and-replay on the Android platform. VALERA works with apps running directly on the phone, and does not re-quire access to the app source code. Through an evaluation on 50 popular Android apps, we show that: VALERA’s replay fidelity far exceeds current record-and-replay approaches for Android; VALERA’s precise timing control and low overhead (about 1 % for either record or replay) allows it to replay high-throughput, timing-sensitive apps such as video/audio capture and recognition; and VALERA’s support for event schedule replay enables the construction of useful analyses, such as reproducing event-driven race bugs...|$|R
