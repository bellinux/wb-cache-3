Second, we focus our attention on complete, (intrinsically) irreducible parallel submanifolds of N. Provided that N is of compact or non-compact type, we establish the extrinsic homogeneity of every complete, irreducible parallel submanifold of N whose dimension is at least 3 and which is not contained in any flat of N.

40|$|We {{consider}} critical spread-out oriented percolation above 4 + 1 dimensions. Our main {{result is}} that the extinction probability at time <b>n</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the probability for the origin to be connected to the hyperplane at time n but not to the hyperplane at time n + 1) decays like 1 /Bn 2 as, where B is a finite positive constant. This in turn implies that the survival probability at time <b>n</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the probability that the origin is connected to the hyperplane at time n) decays like 1 /Bn as. The latter has been shown in an earlier paper to have consequences for the geometry of large critical clusters and for the incipient infinite cluster. The present paper is Part I in a series of two papers. In Part II, we derive a lace expansion for the survival probability, adapted so as to deal with point-to-plane connections. This lace expansion leads to a nonlinear recursion relation for the survival probability. In Part I, we use this recursion relation to deduce the asymptotics via induction...|$|R
