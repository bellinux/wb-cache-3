50|$|A {{gate array}} circuit is a {{prefabricated}} silicon chip circuit with no particular function, in which transistors, standard NAND or NOR logic gates, and other active devices are placed at regular predefined positions and manufactured on a wafer, usually called a <b>master</b> <b>slice.</b> Creation of a circuit with a specified function {{is accomplished by}} adding a final surface layer or layers of metal interconnects to the chips on the <b>master</b> <b>slice</b> late in the manufacturing process, joining these elements to allow {{the function of the}} chip to be customized as desired. This layer is analogous to the copper layer(s) of a printed circuit board (PCB).|$|E
50|$|A {{macrocell}} array is {{an approach}} to the design and manufacture of ASICs. Essentially, {{it is a small}} step up from the otherwise similar gate array, but rather than being a prefabricated array of simple logic gates, the macrocell array is a prefabricated array of higher-level logic functions such as flip-flops, ALU functions, registers, and the like. These logic functions are simply placed at regular predefined positions and manufactured on a wafer, usually called <b>master</b> <b>slice.</b> Creation of a circuit with a specified function is accomplished by adding metal interconnects to the chips on the <b>master</b> <b>slice</b> late in the manufacturing process, allowing the function of the chip to be customised as desired.|$|E

50|$|Macrocell array <b>master</b> <b>slices</b> {{are usually}} {{prefabricated}} and stockpiled {{in large quantities}} regardless of customer orders. The fabrication according to the individual customer specifications may be finished in a shorter time compared with standard cell or full custom design. The macrocell array approach reduces the mask costs since fewer custom masks need to be produced. In addition manufacturing test tooling lead time and costs are reduced since the same test fixtures {{may be used for}} all macrocell array products manufactured on the same die size.|$|R

40|$|A new amplifier-shaper-discriminator (ASD) chip was {{designed}} and manufactured for the Micro Pixel Chamber (μ-PIC). The design of this ASD IC {{is based on the}} ASD IC (TGC-ASD) for the Thin Gap Chamber in the LHC Atlas Experiment. The decay time constant of the preamplifier is 5 -times longer than that of the TGC-ASD, and some other modifications have been made in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the μ-PIC. The ASD IC uses SONY Analog <b>Master</b> <b>Slice</b> bipolar technology. The IC contains 4 channels in a QFP 48 package. The decay time constant of the preamplifier is 80 ns and its gain is approximately 0. 8 V/pC. The output from the preamplifier is received by a shaper (main-amplifier) with a gain of 7. A baseline restoration circuit is incorporated in the main-amplifier, and the current used for the baseline restoration is 5 -times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD. The threshold voltage for the discriminator section is common to the 4 channels and their digital output level is LVDS-compatible. The ASD IC also has an analog output of the preamplifier. The equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pF is around 2000 electrons. The power dissipation with LVDS outputs (100 Ω load) is 57 mW/ch. Using this ASD, the analog output voltage from the signal of the μ-PIC is about 2 -times higher than the case of using the TGC-ASD. As a consequence, the MIPs tracking performance of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with the μ-PIC was improved. The performance of the ASD IC and an improved tracking performance of the TPC are reported. Comment: 6 pages, 14 figures, submitted for IEEE/TNS 200...|$|E

50|$|Darth Maul {{was a male}} Zabrak Sith Master {{who served}} as the first Shadow Hand of Darth Sidious. He first {{appeared}} in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, in which Sidious sent him to find the escaped Queen Amidala and bring her back to Naboo to sign a treaty that would legalize the Trade Federation's invasion there. After tracking the Queen's personal starship to Tatooine, he briefly attacked Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi sent to escort Amidala to Coruscant, near its landing zone until the latter escaped by leaping aboard. Later, Maul was sent back to Naboo to aid the Federation in their struggle to fight Amidala's counterattack, where he again battled Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi in the plasma refinery complex beneath Theed Palace. Although the viscous Zabrak was able to defeat Jinn, he fell to Kenobi when the Padawan used his <b>master's</b> lightsaber to <b>slice</b> Maul in half. 12 years later, during the Clone Wars, his fellow nightbrother Savage Opress found him dumped on the junk planet Lotho Minor, where it was revealed that Maul survived the injuries from his last duel, due to his strength with {{the dark side of the}} Force as it fueled his anger against Kenobi. Maul left the Sith Order and was eventually killed by Kenobi about 20 years later.|$|R

Charge {{decay time}} and {{resistivity}} of the BN as a func-tion of the deposition {{temperature of the}} BN. osci l lator circuit was formed and connected with the selected number of inverter circuits. Taking into ac-count the load capacitance CL between each of the inverter circuit stages, the oscil lation wave forms are calculated and are compared with the observed ones. The observed frequencies are about 15 % less in aver-age than the calculated ones. The leakage current of the inverter transistor through the BN is as small as about 10 - 14 A for the design in Fig. 8, and the drain current under the ring oscil lator operation is {{in the range of}} from 10 - 5 - 10 - 4 A. No effect of the leakage current through the BN was observed in our practical device application. It can be concluded that the BN {{can be used as a}} surface passivation, except for the special devices which need a long charge holding time, such as the FAMOS memory devices. Conclusion The BN deposited at 500 ~ in the B 2 H 6 -I~I~-N 2 sys-tem and covered with SiaN 4 acts as a reproducible dif-fusion source of boron in Si. The boron surface con-centrat ion was maintained at its solid solubility, when the BN thickness was above 500 A. After the boron diffusion no si l icon-boride formation was observed at the interface of the BN and Si. An appl ication example to the MOS IC device is a <b>master</b> <b>slice</b> polycrystal l ine Si-gate self-al igned p-MOS IC. The charge decay t ime on the gate gives the BN resist iv ity of 1013 - 1014 ~-cm, and the BN can be concluded to be useful as a surface passivation of the devices when the BN re-ma ined after the boron diffusion in Si.

50|$|Despite {{there being}} many {{different}} variations and styles, in general {{there are three}} different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand. The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf {{having one of the}} lowest, most effective slice backhands. The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise. However, it is much harder to <b>master.</b> Unlike the <b>slice</b> on its own, the slice backhand refers to a player continuously using slice on their backhand as an ordinary shot, instead of for variety. Most slice backhands are executed with a continental grip, identical to that of the backhand volley. The motion is also simple, and involves a cut at about 45 degrees {{to the bottom of the}} ball. The slice action closer to the bottom results in a higher and slower ball, typically used for lobs while a cut closer to the side of the ball results in a faster and lower ball. It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires lots of practice and finesse. Such slice backhands often prevent opponents from getting under the ball easily and hitting easy winners. It also slows down the pace of the ball due to the back-spin on it, giving time for the player to anticipate and set up shots. For example, Steffi Graf often used her slice backhand to buy time for her to move around and hit inside-out forehands, her signature shot. It can also act as a good bluff to hit drop-shots or even fake drop-shots.|$|R
