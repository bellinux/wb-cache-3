Forty Candida spp. clinical isolates were identified by morphological and biochemical analyses. Identifications were also performed by the new proteomic approach based on MALDI-TOF MS. Results demonstrated 15 % discordance when compared with morphological and biochemical analyses. Discordant isolates were analysed by ITS sequencing, which confirmed the MALDI-TOF MS identifications and these strains were renamed in the culture collection catalogue.

40|$|Introduction. Mass Spectrometry {{technology}} “Matrix-assisted laser desorption Ionisation/Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF MS) ” {{offers a}} promising new approach for identification of bacteria and fungi of clinical interest. The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate the comparison of <b>microbial</b> <b>identifications</b> obtained with the system Axima/Saramis bioMérieux and identifications obtained by conventional manual or automatic (Vitek 2 - bioMérieux). The work was divided into a pilot phase in which the staff has been trained and are set instrument parameters and an operational phase. Methods. MALDI-TOF is a system for the detection and identification of species-specific highly conserved proteins (ribosomal DNA and ligands). Part of a bacterial colony, is deposited on a polymeric substrate, extracted by the addition of the matrix (acid α-Cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The mass spectra obtained are compared with the database Saramis (Anagnostec) containing the reference spectra of common pathogens. Results. During the pilot phase were analyzed 303 microorganisms (281 bacteria and 22 fungi), of which 207 (68. 3 %) correctly identified to species level, 35 (11. 6 %) identified as a species but not the main one and 49 (16. 2 %) did not identified. In the second phase of the study were analyzed microorganisms 1417 (1341 bacteria and 76 fungi) in a period of 60 days in 1240 (87. 5 %) correctly identified to species level, 121 (8. 5 %) identified as a species but not the main one and 41 (2. 9 %) unidentified. Conclusions. By reducing the response time (15 min/ 1 sample), the use of MALDI-TOF system, bioMérieux facilitates the workflow in the clinical laboratory, and positive impact on length of stay and costs. In addition, the rapid identification of yeasts at the species level is definitely a value added important and independent execution of test sensitivity.

40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} improve the outcome of patients, reduce length of stay, costs and {{resources}} engaged in diagnostics, more rapid reports are requested to the clinical microbiologists. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the impact on workflow of MALDI-TOF technology, recently made available for use in routine diagnostics. Methods:The work list by the management information system is sent to the instrument MALDI-TOF, where are held at least three successive analytic sessions: the first includes bacteria isolated from CSF, blood cultures, and cases already reported as serious/urgent, the second includes all other germs isolated, the third, microorganisms that require extraction with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or formic acid (FA) for identification. The results of each session direct to the execution of different types of susceptibility testing. Results:The times of <b>microbial</b> <b>identifications</b> are reduced by 24 or 48 hours and made available to the clinician for the rational empirical therapy. The reagent costs are reduced by 40 %. The subcultures were reduced by 80 %, and microscopic examinations by 50 %. The antibiotic susceptibility tests were immediately performed with the most appropriate method, based on the knowledge of local epidemiology and microbial species. Conclusion:The bacteriology is the less automated discipline among the clinical laboratory activities and results of diagnostic tests are poorly well-timed. The new interpretative algorithms of MALDI-TOF spectra, now available, allow the correct identification of bacteria in near real time, completely eliminating the wait is necessary for biochemical identification and guiding the operator in selecting the most appropriate antibiotic susceptibility tests.

Bronchial washing is part of a bronchoscopy procedure. After being isolated and stored, strain D5610 was acquired by The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC sent 68 strains of Legionella, including strain D5610 for students to analyze at Clemson University. When isolated, it was shown to be very similar to bacteria genus Legionella. Researchers stated that [...] "it was identified as Legionella based on sequencing, cellular fatty acid analysis, biochemical reactions, and biofilm characterization." [...] For a physical characterization of Legionella clemsonensis, it was streaked for a single colony isolation using a charcoal yeast extract agar and required cysteine for primary isolation. No growth was shown, which was typical of Legionella strains. A characteristic that was found about Legionella clemsonensis is that it has a single, polar flagella.
