5000|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of}} <b>materials</b> <b>science,</b> also commonly termed <b>materials</b> <b>science</b> and engineering, involves the discovery {{and design of}} new materials, {{with an emphasis on}} solids. The intellectual origins of <b>materials</b> <b>science</b> stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. <b>Materials</b> <b>science</b> still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, <b>materials</b> <b>science</b> began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study.|$|R

Such methods are likely to be based on probability and statistics (i.e., risk assessment techniques) as much as on engineering and <b>material</b> <b>science.</b>|$|E

25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and <b>material</b> <b>science</b> theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E
