25|$|In 2008, Shanghai GM {{introduced}} a <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{system on the}} LaCrosse. Using the Belt Alternator Starter system, {{it is the first}} hybrid vehicle in the Chinese market as well as the first hybrid in its segment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>hybrid,</b> is {{a vehicle}} that cannot be driven solely on its {{electric}} motor, because the electric motor {{does not have enough}} power to propel the vehicle on its own. Mild hybrids only include some of the features found in hybrid technology, and usually achieve limited fuel consumption savings, up to 15 percent in urban driving and 8 to 10 percent overall cycle. A <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> is essentially a conventional vehicle with oversize starter motor, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly. The motor is often mounted between the engine and transmission, taking the place of the torque converter, and is used to supply additional propulsion energy when accelerating. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the gasoline engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative braking to recapture energy. As compared to full hybrids, mild hybrids have smaller batteries and a smaller, weaker motor/generator, which allows manufacturers to reduce cost and weight.|$|E
25|$|The Mercedes-Benz S400 BlueHybrid was {{unveiled}} in the 2009 Chicago Auto Show, and sales {{began in the}} U.S. in October 2009. The S400 BlueHybrid is a <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> and the first hybrid car to adopt a lithium ion battery. The hybrid technology in the S400 was co-developed by Daimler AG and BMW. The same hybrid technology is {{being used in the}} BMW ActiveHybrid 7, expected to go on sales in the U.S. and Europe by mid-2010. In December 2009 BMW began sales of its full hybrid BMW ActiveHybrid X6, while Daimler launched the Mercedes-Benz ML450 Hybrid by lease only.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> are {{generally}} internal combustion engines {{equipped with an}} electric machine (one motor/generator in a parallel configuration) allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly. <b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> may employ regenerative brake and some level of power assist to {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE), but <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> do not have an exclusive electric-only mode of propulsion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> are {{essentially}} conventional vehicles with some hybrid hardware, but with limited hybrid features. Typically, {{they are a}} parallel hybrid with start-stop only or possibly with modest levels of engine assist or regenerative braking. <b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> generally cannot provide all-electric propulsion.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> are {{sometimes}} called Power assist hybrids as {{they use the}} ICE for primary power, with a torque-boosting electric motor connected to a (largely) conventional power train. The electric motor is mounted between the engine and transmission. It is essentially a large starter motor that operates when the engine needs to be turned over and when the driver [...] "steps on the gas" [...] and requires extra power. The electric motor may also restart the combustion engine and shutting down the main engine at idle, while the enhanced battery system is used to power accessories. GM announced Buick LaCrosse and Buick Regal <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> dubbed Eassist.|$|R
25|$|The 2012 Lacrosse {{features}} a new <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> as its base model. Dubbed eAssist, the 2012 Lacrosse introduced GM's second generation Belt-Alternator-Starter system. The non-hybrid 4-cylinder {{is no longer}} offered. The system consists of a 115-volt lithium-ion battery pack, a 15kW electric motor capable of adding 15 horsepower of assist while accelerating, and the next generation 6T40 GM Hydramatic transmission with reduced friction components over the previous generation. The eAssist LaCrosse delivers a class leading fuel economy of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. In addition to providing additional power to the 182hp 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, the BAS-II system allows for engine start/stop operation when the vehicle isn't moving and allows for complete fuel cut off to the engine during deceleration.|$|E
2500|$|The Aura Green Line was a <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid,</b> {{following}} the Vue Green Line {{as the second}} vehicle in Saturn's lineup incorporating GM's belt alternator starter system. [...] It rode on the XE's suspension. It was sold from late March 2007 to 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The Hyundai Elantra LPI Hybrid was {{unveiled}} at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show, and sales {{began in the}} South Korean domestic market in July 2009. The Elantra LPI (Liquefied Petroleum Injected) is the world's first hybrid vehicle to be powered by an internal combustion engine built to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a fuel. The Elantra PLI is a <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> and the first hybrid to adopt advanced lithium polymer (Li–Poly) batteries. The Elantra LPI Hybrid delivers a fuel economy rating of [...] and CO2 emissions of 99 g/km to qualify as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Chrysler used the Intrepid as a {{research}} platform for a hybrid electric vehicle in a diesel-electric configuration. Three variations were built, the Intrepid ESX, ESX II, and ESX III. The first vehicle was built in a series hybrid configuration, while the next two were considered <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids.</b> These were attempted in the time frame of 1997 to 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Modifying key engine-selection {{parameters}} in the Battery Management System of {{a hybrid}} vehicle. Vehicles as <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> have a parameter for the threshold speed {{on which the}} vehicle is to switch from electric propulsion to the internal combustion engine. Introducing a higher speed as a parameter can reduce emissions and increase fuel efficiency (although it may increase strain on the battery).|$|R
50|$|Parallel hybrids can {{be further}} {{categorized}} by the balance between the different motors are at providing motive power: the ICE may be dominant (engaging the electric motor only in specific circumstances) or vice versa; while in others can run on the electric system alone but because current parallel hybrids are unable to provide electric-only or internal combustion-only modes they are often categorized as <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> (see below).|$|R

25|$|In May 2004, GM {{delivered}} the world's first full-sized hybrid pickups, the 1/2-ton Silverado/Sierra. These <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{did not use}} electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. In 2005, the Opel Astra diesel Hybrid concept vehicle was introduced. The 2006 Saturn Vue Green Line was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design. GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in freeway driving.|$|R
40|$|With {{ever-increasing}} oil prices, {{there is}} fast {{growing interest in}} hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) globally. Thus, it is a pressing need for researchers to develop emerging energy-efficient devices for various kinds of HEVs, including the micro <b>hybrids,</b> <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids,</b> and full hybrids. In this paper, three key emerging energy-efficient technologies are identified and discussed: 1) the thermoelectric waste-heat recovery and temperature control systems for all hybrids, especially micro hybrids; 2) the integrated-starter-generator for mild hybrids; and 3) the electronic continuously variable transmission propulsion for full hybrids © 2006 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|HSD {{technology}} {{produces a}} full hybrid vehicle {{which allows the}} car to run on the electric motor only, as opposed to most other brand hybrids which cannot and are considered <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The HSD also combines an electric drive and a planetary gearset which performs similarly to a continuously variable transmission. The Synergy Drive is a drive-by-wire system with no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the engine controls: both the gas pedal/accelerator and the gearshift lever in an HSD car merely send electrical signals to a control computer.|$|R

The system is also can give more accelaration when needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{like the}} General Motors 2004-07 Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and the Honda Eco-Assist hybrids are {{equipped}} with a three-phase electric motor mounted within the bell-housing between the engine and transmission, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the truck is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly to provide power. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, regenerative braking recaptures energy. The large electric motor spins up the engine to operating speeds before injecting fuel.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} {{without the use}} of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle {{can also be used to}} reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} and NOx emissions of different Diesel-Electric hybrid powertrains, equipping a mid-size European passenger car were evaluated {{in this paper}} through numerical simulation. Different degrees of hybridizations, from micro to <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids,</b> and different architectures and power sources management strategies were taken into account, {{in order to obtain}} a preliminary assessment of the potentialities of a Diesel-Electric hybrid system for the European passenger car market. Both regulated driving cycles, such as NEDC, and "real-world representative" driving cycles, such as Artemis cycles, were evaluated, in order to obtain not only an estimate of the impact of hybridization on type-approval CO 2 and NOx emissions, but also an assessment of the impact of these technologies from the vehicle owner's perspective.

50|$|BAS is {{an acronym}} for belted {{alternator}} starter. It is a category of automotive parallel hybrid technology that uses an electric motor to contribute power to the internal combustion engine's crankshaft via a serpentine belt. By mounting this motor generator unit in the conventional location traditionally used for the standard automotive alternator, it permits a low-cost method of adding <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> capabilities such as start-stop, power assist, and mild levels of regenerative braking. BAS differ from other <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> systems as they are not run off the vehicle's crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Daihatsu debuted the Hijet Cargo Hybrid concept, {{a hybrid}} van, in Japan using a 660 cc engine. The car {{is based on}} the {{existing}} non-hybrid Hijet Cargo. Daihatsu calls it a <b>mild</b> <b>hybrid</b> design. Its design (called Daihatsu <b>Mild</b> <b>Hybrid</b> System or DMHS based on Toyota hybrid technology) is quite different from many existing hybrid design where as the gas and electric powered components assembled as one unit. The electric motor sits between the gasoline-powered engine and the transmission unit. The car is 30% more fuel efficient than its gasoline-powered counterpart.|$|E

5000|$|The {{electric}} motor provides greater efficiency by replacing the starter and alternator {{with a single}} device which assists the powertrain. <b>Mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> do not require {{the same level of}} battery power and do not achieve the same levels of fuel economy improvement as compared to full hybrid models. One example is the 2005-07 Chevrolet Silverado, Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) a full-size pickup truck with a single 7 kW 3-phase {{electric motor}} mounted in the bell-housing between the engine and a conventional 4L60E transmission. Chevrolet was able to get a 10% improvement on the Silverado's city fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand, and the reduction of parasitic accessory loads. However the PHT had no power assist features or all-electric [...] "electric vehicle" [...] (EV) capability, and very limited regenerative braking features.|$|R

Both diesel and gasoline internal combustion engines were considered: a 1. 6 dm 3 Common Rail turbocharged diesel, and a 1. 4 dm 3 spark ignition turbocharged engine, equipped with an innovative Variable Valve Actuation system. Diesel hybrid powertrains, although being subject to NOx emissions constraints that could jeopardize their benefits, offered substantial advantages in comparison with gasoline hybrid powertrains.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 15 th Global Warming International Conference in San Francisco, April 22, 2004 This paper {{is concerned with the}} present status and future projections for emerging technologies that can be utilized in light-duty vehicles in the next five to ten years to significantly reduce their CO 2 emissions. The emerging technologies considered are modern clean diesel engines and hybrid-electric powertrains using batteries and/or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Throughout the study, six classes of vehiclesâ€”compact passenger cars to large SUVsâ€”were considered. For each vehicle class, computer simulations (Advisor 2002) and cost analyses were performed for conventional ICE and mild and full parallel hybrids using port-fuel injected and lean burn gasoline engines and direct-injection turbo-charged diesel engines to determine the fuel economy and differential costs for the various vehicle designs using the conventional gasoline PFI engine vehicle as the baseline. CO 2 emissions (gmCO 2 /mi) for each driveline and vehicle case were calculated from the fuel economy values. On a percentage or ratio basis, the analyses indicated that the fuel economy gains, CO 2 emissions reductions, and cost/price increases due {{to the use of the}} advanced engines and hybrid-electric drivelines were essentially independent of vehicle class. This means that a regulation specifying the same fractional reductions in CO 2 emissions for all the vehicle classes would not favor one class over the others. The results of the study were then used to calculate the increase in the CAFE standard (miles per gallon gasoline for the new car fleet) that was feasible using each of the emerging technologies and the associated vehicle price increase that would be incurred. It was determined that the CAFE standard could be increased to 38 mpg and 48 mpg using the PFI and lean-burn gasoline engines, respectively, in <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> with an associated percentage price increase of 7 - 9 %. The CAFE standard could be increased to 42 mpg and 52 mpg using the PFI and lean-burn gasoline engines, respectively, in full hybrids with an associated cost increase of 16 - 18 %. The CAFE increases using the diesel engines in <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> were close to those of gasoline engines in full hybrids. The vehicle price increases using diesel engines in hybrids were 17 - 23 % compared to the baseline ICE vehicles using the PFI engine. The fleet CO 2 emissions corresponding to the cited CAFE standards were 185 - 234 gmCO 2 /mi for the <b>mild</b> <b>hybrids</b> using gasoline engines and 170 - 208 gmCO 2 /mi for full hybrids. The corresponding values using diesel engines are 189 - 216 gmCO 2 /mi.

Some car makers even announce the introduction of pure electric vehicles. The core objective if this paper is to analyze the following questions for the example of Austria: How does the introduction of hybrid electric and pure electric vehicles affect the energy system? How long does it take to shift the vehicle fleet from conventional drives to partly and fully electrified drives? What are the main factors that influence this development? What role can policy play in this shift?
