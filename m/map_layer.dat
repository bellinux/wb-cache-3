40|$|Weights-of-evidence {{modeling}} is a GIS-based {{technique for}} relating a point pattern for lo-cations of discrete events with several <b>map</b> <b>layers.</b> In general, the <b>map</b> <b>layers</b> are binary or ternary. Weights for presence, absence or missing data {{are added to}} a prior logit. Updating with two or more <b>map</b> <b>layers</b> is allowed only if the <b>map</b> <b>layers</b> are approximately condition-ally independent of the point pattern. The final product is a map of posterior probabilities of occurrence of the discrete event within a small unit cell. This paper contains formal proof that conditional independence of <b>map</b> <b>layers</b> implies that T, {{the sum of the}} posterior probabilities weighted according to unit cell area, is equal to n, being the total number of discrete events. This result is used in the overall or “omnibus test ” for conditional independence. In practical applications, T generally exceeds n, indicating a possible lack of conditional independence. Estimation of the standard deviation of T allows performance of a one-tailed test to check whether or not T-n is significantly greater than zero. This new test is exact and simpler to use than other tests including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and various chi-squared tests adapted from discrete multivariate statistics...|$|R

50|$|A few {{games have}} experimented with diversifying map design, which {{continues}} to be largely two-dimensional even in 3D engines. Earth 2150 allowed units to tunnel underground, effectively creating a dual-layer map; three-layer (orbit-surface-underground) maps were introduced in Metal Fatigue. In addition, units could even be transported to entirely separate maps, with each map having its own window in the user interface. Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon (2001) offered a simpler model: the main map contains locations that expand into their own maps. In these examples, however, gameplay was essentially identical regardless of the <b>map</b> <b>layer</b> in question. Dragonshard (2005) emphasized its dual-layer maps by placing one of the game's two main resources in each map, making exploration and control of both maps fundamentally valuable.|$|E

50|$|In December 2005, Google {{launched}} {{public transport}} route planner Google Transit on Google Labs, a 20% project of Chris Harrelson and Avichal Garg. Google Transit launched initially with support for Portland, Oregon, and now includes hundreds of {{cities in the}} United States, Canada, Europe, Africa and Australasia. The service calculates route, transit time and cost, and can compare the trip to one using a car. In October 2007 Google Transit graduated from Google Labs and became fully integrated into Google Maps. Google has provided real-time transit updates for selected locations since 2011. Google created the General Transit Feed Specification (formerly 'Google Transit Feed Specification') as a simple way of exchanging transit information. GTFSs are needed for {{information to be provided}} on Maps.The coverage of Google Transit is publicly available. It is spread worldwide, in hundreds of cities and sometimes in entire countries such as China, Great Britain, Japan and Switzerland.

50|$|Vector-based GIS is {{typically}} related to operations such as map overlay (combining {{two or more}} maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance {{of one or more}} features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) {{the use of the term}} spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) “simple feature specifications”. For raster-based GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, th{{is typically}} means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new <b>map</b> <b>layer,</b> for example replacing each cell value with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term spatial analysis. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, exploratory, and explanatory statistics) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.|$|E
