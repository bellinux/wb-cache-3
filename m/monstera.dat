2500|$|The male beetles {{will stay}} {{overnight}} in the spathe, eating and mating throughout the night due to the benefits provided by the spathe and spadix. Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46°C in some species, but usually around 35°C. [...] The thermogenesis coincides {{with the arrival of}} the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20°C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to Philodendron and <b>Monstera,</b> as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45° relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. [...] The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis – Controller Economics, Linneaus University Title: From data to {{information}} – {{a case study}} at Södra Cell <b>Mönsterås</b> Authors: Sofie Gotting, Renée Lundberg and Emma Molin Tutor: Anders Jerreling Examiner: Fredrik Karlsson In Sweden, the process industries employs nearly 600 000 people and it accounts for about 60 percent of the country's net export. In many industries today, {{there is a growing}} emphasis on calculations. They are used to manage and control the activities in today’s organizations, one of these industries is the process industry. Both the preliminary calculations in the form of budgets and follow-up calculations have grown in importance. The current situation at Södra Cell <b>Mönsterås</b> is that there are some problems with the collection of the data that is used {{as the basis for the}} follow-up calculations. The purpose of this paper is to describe what the general problems surrounding data capture for calculations and the methods that could improve data collection. The study will then describe the current problems surrounding data collection and information flows at Södra Cell <b>Mönsterås</b> and suggest improvements. The essay consists of a qualitative case study at Södra Cell <b>Mönsterås</b> and the empirical material consists mainly of semi-structured interviews and observations. The study shows the need for better methods to ensure data quality in data capture at Södra Cell <b>Mönsterås.</b> Furthermore, it shows the need for information to flow more effectively in order to become a tool in the process of data quality control. The study culminates in a number of recommendations to the company that may be solutions on the way to an improved information flow and data quality...|$|R
