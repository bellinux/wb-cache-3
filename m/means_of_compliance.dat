40|$|Introduction "Goal-based regulation" {{does not}} specify the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> {{achieving}} <b>compliance</b> but sets goals that allow alternative ways <b>of</b> achieving <b>compliance,</b> e. g. "People shall be prevented from falling {{over the edge}} of the cliff". In "prescriptive regulation" the specific <b>means</b> <b>of</b> achieving <b>compliance</b> is mandated, e. g. "You shall install a 1 meter high rail at the edge of the cliff". There is an increasing tendency to adopt a goal-based approach to safety regulation, and there are good technical and commercial reasons for believing this approach is preferable to more prescriptive regulation. It is however important to address the practical problems associated with goal-based regulation in order for it to be applied effectively. This paper will first discuss the motivation for adopting a goal-based regulatory approach, and then illustrate the implementation by describing SW 01 which forms part of the CAP 670 [CAA 1998] regulations for ground-based air traffic services (ATS).

5000|$|The DO-254 {{standard}} was formally {{recognized by the}} FAA in 2005 via AC 20-152 as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> {{for the design of}} complex electronic hardware in airborne systems. Complex electronic hardware includes devices like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The DO-254 standard is the counterpart to the well-established software standard RTCA DO-178B/EUROCAE ED-12B. With DO-254, the FAA has indicated that avionics equipment contains both hardware and software, and each is critical to safe operation of aircraft. There are five levels of compliance, A through E, which depend on the effect a failure of the hardware will have on the operation of the aircraft. Level A is the most stringent, defined as [...] "catastrophic" [...] (e.g. loss of the aircraft), while a failure of Level E hardware will not affect the safety of the aircraft. Meeting Level A compliance for complex electronic hardware requires a much higher level of verification and validation than Level E compliance.|$|E

In order to be granted with the Type Certification for that specific aircraft in development, the applicant must go through the certification regulations, and demonstrate compliance for every requirement stated in the RBHA/FAR/JAR 25 regulation. The <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> for every single requirement shall be defined in the early stage of {{the aircraft}} designing process and structured in a format of a "compliance check list". The primary intent of this process is to follow the aircraft design and development phases and check that all safety and certification requirements are met. Also the methods of compliance (design review / drawing, analysis, flight tests, ground tests, lab tests, qualification tests, simulations, inspections, similarities) are assigned, as part of this <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> process and these are to get early commitment of acceptability of the way that the aircraft is designed and developed from the certification authorities. The intent of this report is to describe a certification tool that supports the aircraft propulsion system design and development by defining an acceptable <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> to the RBHA/FAR/JAR 25 regulation - Subpart E, based on a generic aircraft with high-bypass turbofan installed engines (twin). Some historical service accidents summaries caused by propulsion system malfunctions and failures are reported within this document in order to highlight the importance of the accomplishment of this certification process.
