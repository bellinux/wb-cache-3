40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{document}} {{the rise in}} copayments for patients in disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> and {{to call attention to}} the inherent conflicts that exist between these 2 approaches to benefit design. METHODS: Data from 2 large health plans were used to compare cost sharing in disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> with cost sharing outside of disease <b>management</b> <b>programs.</b> RESULTS: The copayments charged to participants in disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> usually do not differ substantially from those charged to other beneficiaries. CONCLUSIONS: Cost sharing and disease management result in conflicting approaches to benefit design. Increasing copayments may lead to underuse of recommended services, thereby decreasing the clinical effectiveness and increasing the overall costs of disease <b>management</b> <b>programs.</b> Policymakers and private purchasers should consider the use of targeted benefit designs when implementing disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> or redesigning cost-sharing provisions. Current information systems and health services research are sufficiently advanced to permit these benefit designs...|$|R

5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and <b>Management</b> <b>Program</b> report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: To {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{opinion on the}} extent to which asthma disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> currently improve the effectiveness and efficiency of care and directions for future policy and research. Recent findings: The methodological quality of health technology assessment of asthma disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> remains moderate. Asthma disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> are predominantly educational and organizational in nature and focus either on children or on adults. Paediatric disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> make more effort to outreach into patients' living environments and show higher participation rates than those targeting adults. Reductions in asthma-related hospitalization, emergency department, and unplanned clinic visits range from 0 to 85 %, 87 % and 71 %, respectively. Aspects of self-management and organization of care improved after the implementation of disease <b>management</b> <b>programs.</b> Almost no impact on asthma symptoms, lung function or the use of long-term control medication was found. Summary: There is accumulating ‘circumstantial’ evidence that disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> reduce resource utilization. The analytical rigor and uniformity of health technology assessment of asthma disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> has improved, but the generalizability of results remains uncertain.

The historical evolution of sport <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States moved from the physical education model to a more business-oriented curriculum. Given this historical development, debate exists among sport management professionals regarding administrative housing of current and future sport <b>management</b> <b>programs.</b> The purposes of this study were to: (1) Provide an overview of the development of U.

40|$|Objective Evaluating {{the impact}} of disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> on {{healthcare}} expenditures for patients with diabetes, depression, heart failure or COPD. Methods Systematic Pubmed search for studies reporting {{the impact of}} disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> on healthcare expenditures. Included were studies that contained two or more components of Wagner's chronic care model and were published between January 2007 and December 2009. Results Thirty-one papers were selected, describing disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> for patients with diabetes (nÂ =Â  14), depression (nÂ =Â  4), heart failure (nÂ =Â  8), and COPD (nÂ =Â  5). Twenty-one studies reported incremental healthcare costs per patient per year, of which 13 showed cost-savings. Incremental costs ranged between -$ 16, 996 and $ 3305 per patient per year. Substantial variation was found between studies in terms of study design, number and combination of components of disease <b>management</b> <b>programs,</b> interventions within components, and characteristics of economic evaluations. Conclusion Although {{it is widely believed}} that disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> reduce healthcare expenditures, the present study shows that evidence for this claim is still inconclusive. Nevertheless disease <b>management</b> <b>programs</b> are increasingly implemented in healthcare systems worldwide. To support well-considered decision-making in this field, well-designed economic evaluations should be stimulated.

The game's level and content <b>management</b> <b>program,</b> UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
