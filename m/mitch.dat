5|$|Late on October29, <b>Mitch</b> {{weakened}} to {{tropical storm}} status. It moved slowly across Honduras, {{turning to the}} west. The large circulation dropped heavy rainfall throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, causing widespread flooding. While over land, <b>Mitch</b> initially maintained an area of deep convection, which allowed it to maintain tropical storm force winds. On October31, the circulation became poorly defined while moving over increasingly mountainous terrain; however, the strongest convection persisted over the adjacent Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted the potential for <b>Mitch</b> to become a Pacific tropical cyclone. Later that day, <b>Mitch</b> weakened into a tropical depression near the border of Guatemala and Honduras. An approaching trough weakened the ridge in the western Gulf of Mexico, allowing <b>Mitch</b> to make the long-intended turn to the northwest. Convection gradually diminished, and the surface circulation of <b>Mitch</b> dissipated on November1 near the border of Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} <b>Mitch</b> maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on <b>Mitch</b> about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon reforming, <b>Mitch</b> was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, <b>Mitch</b> made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|At peak intensity, <b>Mitch</b> {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, <b>Mitch</b> turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, <b>Mitch</b> slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of <b>Mitch</b> dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. <b>Mitch</b> accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucatán Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Mitch</b> was {{the second}} deadliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record and the deadliest recorded hurricane in the satellite era. The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1998 hurricane season. Along with Hurricane Georges, <b>Mitch</b> was the most notable hurricane in the season. At the time, Hurricane <b>Mitch</b> was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed {{in the month of}} October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. The hurricane matched the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh).|$|E

5|$|Before {{the storm}} struck, Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions. The economy {{had been growing}} at a rate similar to the previous year until <b>Mitch</b> struck, and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty when the storm struck. Hurricane <b>Mitch</b> set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch's {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over Africa as a tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm <b>Mitch.</b> A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, <b>Mitch</b> quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, <b>Mitch</b> rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E
