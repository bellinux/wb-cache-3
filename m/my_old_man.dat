5|$|Like many English {{football}} clubs, Aston Villa {{have had}} several hooligan firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As {{can be seen}} across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms {{were involved in a}} fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group <b>My</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, {{as a direct result of}} Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity.|$|E

40|$|Accompanying PDF {{contains}} critical essay. Access to thesis {{and accompanying}} PDF permanently restricted to Ball State community onlyMy grandfathers {{and my two}} great uncles, <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>men,</b> were heroes to me. Growing up in the cushy suburbs of Cincinnati, I knew I {{wanted to be a}} man like they were men. I wanted to invent and build to solve problems, to hunt and fish, to know how to do hard labor, and to live like they lived. In this immersion journalism project I seek to reconcile the differences between my lack of self-reliance, the skills I deemed necessary to be considered a man, and the skills <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> possessed, by attempting to live like they lived. I worked at Smoke Rise Ranch as a ranch hand for three weeks, and let loose twenty-one yearling heifers. I went hunting for deer, but never fired my gun. I built a very fine quilt rack after first failing miserably. These efforts at attaining a connection with <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> fill these pages as lighthearted anecdotes of incompetence and struggle, moments of triumph, and my recognition of my heroes’ flaws: {{it is not easy to}} deconstruct a hero. It is a narrative of choices, of attempting to define the kind of man I want to be for my family in light of the kind of men they were. Some names have been changed.

Helen Baskin moved to St. Louis, Missouri, with some of her children, leaving Liston—aged around 13, {{according}} to his later reckonings—in Arkansas with his father. Sonny thrashed the pecans from his brother-in-law's tree and sold them in Forrest City. With the proceeds, he traveled to St. Louis and reunited {{with his mother and}} siblings. Liston tried going to school but quickly left after jeers about his illiteracy; the only employment he could obtain was sporadic and exploitative.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. <b>My</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
