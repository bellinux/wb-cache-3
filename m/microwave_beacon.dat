40|$|The use of <b>microwave</b> <b>beacon</b> {{transmissions}} from synchronous {{and near}} synchronous satellites is discussed {{as a means}} of measuring atmospheric absorption. It is suggested that, with a fixed angle of elevation of a synchronous satellite, complete diurnal coverage of the integrated absorption is available. In addition, with refined interferometric equipment, angle of arrival studies can be made and phase deviations measured...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} focused on {{construction}} of source of modulation signal for <b>microwave</b> <b>beacon.</b> The output signal {{is the same as}} signal, which is generated by PC software WSJT (Weak Signal by Joe Taylor) on PC sound card output. Signal on device output is modulated using by WSJT modulation and its specific JT 4 mode. The device output has I and Q components of signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{specific}} design project for the Venus balloon beacon, in which a <b>microwave</b> <b>beacon</b> is required to operate for a limited time at high temperature (350 C) and at high pressure, (10 bars). In a chemically hostile environment after surviving large mechanical shock forces (up to 280 gs) are discussed. It was found that many existing, commerically-available component {{can be used in}} such a design with only minor modifications. A further result is that a crude (and consequently low-cost) test program can be designed to identify and select promising commercial components...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to identifying propagation, <b>microwave</b> <b>beacons</b> {{are also used}} as signal sources to test and calibrate antennas and receivers. SHF beacons are not as common as beacons on the lower bands, and beacons above the 3 centimeters band (10 GHz) are unusual.|$|R
50|$|An amateur radio {{propagation}} beacon is a radio beacon, whose purpose is {{the investigation of}} the propagation of radio signals. Most {{radio propagation}} beacons use amateur radio frequencies. They can be found on LF, MF, HF, VHF, UHF, and <b>microwave</b> frequencies. <b>Microwave</b> <b>beacons</b> are also used as signal sources to test and calibrate antennas and receivers.|$|R
40|$|The Billion-channel ExtraTerrestrial Assay (BETA) is a radioastronomical {{search for}} <b>microwave</b> <b>beacons</b> from {{intelligent}} civilizations. It searches the 1400 - 1720 MHz "waterhole " region with 0. 5 Hz resolution for narrow-band carriers. BETA incorporates several systems for terrestrial {{radio frequency interference}} mitigation: a terrestrial "veto" feed, two sky feeds to detect sidereal motion, and adaptive filtering to reduce intermittent interference. The search has surveyed the entire sky from + 60 # to - 30 # declination twice and is starting a third. During this time it has sifted through # 10 16 frequency bins, followed # 10 9 candidate features and archived 3500 of these which passed preliminary tests. No candidate has repeated or otherwise presents the assumed characteristics of an extraterrestrial intelligent origin.

40|$|This bachelorâ€™s thesis {{describes}} an antenna design for <b>microwave</b> <b>beacon</b> in 10 GHz band. In {{the first section}} of the work, the possible solutions are presented and a slot antenna, constructed from commercially available waveguide, is chosen. In the second section, the principle of this antenna is described and the dimensions for the chosen frequency and the type of waveguide are calculated. In the third section, the antenna model is built and simulated in the Ansof HFSS environment in accordance with theoretically calculated dimensions and, based on these simulations, two possible versions of antenna are created...|$|E
40|$|This book {{tells you}} {{all you want}} to know about optical fibers: Their structure, their light-guiding mechanism, their {{material}} and manufacture, their use. It began with telephone, then came telefax and email. Today we use search engines, music downloads and internet videos, all of which require shuffling of bits and bytes by the zillions. The key to all this is the conduit: the line which is designed to carry massive amounts of data at breakneck speed. In their data carrying capacity optical fiber lines beat all other technologies (copper cable, <b>microwave</b> <b>beacons,</b> satellite links) hands down, at least in the long haul; wireless devices rely on fibers, too. Several effects tend to degrade the signal as it travels down the fiber: they are spelled out in detail. Nonlinear processes are given due consideration for a twofold reason: On the one hand they are fundamentally different from the more familiar processes in electrical cable. On the other hand, they form the basis of particularly interesting and innovative applications, provided they are understood well enough. A case in point is the use of so-called solitons, i. e. special pulses of light which have the wonderful property of being able to heal after perturbation. The book will take you from the physical basics of ray and beam optics, explain fiber structure and the functions of optical elements, and bring you to the forefront of both applications and research. The state of the art of high speed data transmission is described, and the use of fiber optic sensors in metrology is treated. The book is written in a pedagogical style so that students of both physics and electrical engineering, as well as technicians and engineers involved in optical technologies, will benefit. The new edition is largely updated and has new sections on nonlinear phenomena in fibers as well as on the latest trends in applications...|$|R

Prof. Fedor Mitschke, a German physicist, was involved in pioneering work on fiber-optic solitons at Bell Laboratories in 1985 - 86. He has held teaching positions at universities in Hannover, Munich, Munster, and Rostock (all in Germany). Since 1997 he holds the chair for optics at the Institute of Physics at Rostock University. This book grew out of lectures he gave at Hannover, Munster, Rostock, and as visiting professor in Lule, Sweden...|$|R
