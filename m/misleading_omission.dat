First, [...] "there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer." [...] In the case of omissions, the Commission considers the implied representations understood by the consumer. A <b>misleading</b> <b>omission</b> occurs when information is not disclosed to correct reasonable consumer expectations. [...] Second, the Commission examines the practice {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable consumer being targeted by the practice. Finally the representation or omission must be a material one—that is one that would have changed consumer behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines the early {{impact of the}} Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 / 29 /EC on enforcers in Scotland {{within the context of}} current policy developments regarding the use of civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms within the UK. The Directive has been implemented in the UK by means of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 SI 1277 and the duty to enforce the Regulations falls primarily to local authority trading standards services. Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with a range of officers employed within the trading standards service based in eight local authorities in Scotland on their perceptions of the new Regulations. The main findings were that officers' views of the new Regulations and the civil and criminal enforcement routes available to them was affected by structural, operational, and cultural issues which varied from one authority to another. A number of officers were finding the Regulations a challenge to old ways and there was evidence that many felt unprepared for the Regulations. A number of positive views were expressed regarding the flexibility of the new Regulations and the advantages of the provisions relating to <b>misleading</b> <b>omissions.</b> Overall officers' experiences of the Regulations were heavily influenced by the complaints received by their particular local authority service. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnfair Commercial Practices Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer commercial practice before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of Unfair Business-to-Consumer Commercial Practices of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer commercial practices and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading commercial practices, ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading commercial practices into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and <b>misleading</b> <b>omissions</b> is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice. In conclusion authors formulate key recommendations for consumer protection institutions and courts, applying the rules on misleading commercial practices...|$|R

40|$|Informed consent {{requirements}} for medical research have expanded {{over the past}} half-century. The focus here is upon one aspect of this expansion: the introduction of explicit obligations to inform subjects about funding sources, in the Declaration of Helsinki. Whilst it is agreed from the outset that a failure to inform about funding sources can wrong a research subject, a general obligation is problematic {{in a number of}} ways: including, determining the scope of the norm; plus problems with subjects’ comprehension of complex funding information, and, most importantly, that such a norm seems to oblige researchers to disclose too much, including information irrelevant to most consent decisions. We ask whether the general obligation in Helsinki might be justified by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent, but find that it cannot be. The general obligation seems to rest upon an “informational fallacy”. We then note that this orthodox justification of research ethics—by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent—has been subject to various critiques. The aim {{in the second part of}} the paper is to provide a better approach to making sense of how a failure to inform about funding sources wrongs subjects: making appeal to obligations to refrain from <b>misleading</b> by <b>omission.</b> This alternative approach—grounded in obligations to refrain from misleading—provides a basis for a norm that protects subjects interests without being hostage to the orthodox justification, that avoids the informational fallacy, and that—by and large—avoids the problems noted above about the scope of the obligation, and its implications for subjects’ comprehension...|$|R

Ultimately this action was based on the misstatements of TRENDnet, rather than the security of the products themselves. [...] On February 4, 2014, the FTC provided a statement to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, stating that Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §45(a) gives the agency the authority to regulate security standards."If a company makes materially <b>misleading</b> statements or <b>omissions</b> about a matter, including data security, and such statements or omissions are likely to mislead reasonable consumers, they can be found to be deceptive in violation of Section 5." [...] "Further, if a company’s data security practices cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is neither reasonably avoidable by consumers nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition, those practices can be found to be unfair and violate Section 5." [...] Over the last decade, the FTC has used the authority to punish “unfair” and “deceptive” trade practices to investigate companies that collect, monitor, or use personal information about consumers. As it did in the TRENDnet case, the FTC frequently alleges violations of both provisions in data privacy investigations.|$|R

Henriques as {{being among the}} [...] "retired or former {{military}} people" [...] recruited to the corporate boards and sales forces of investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans in order to lend them credibility. The investment firm that had recruited Zinni, First Command Financial Planning, Inc., responded in written comments to a subsequent United States House of Representatives investigation that [...] "It would be unfortunate if anyone inferred that these honorable individuals would take any action or support any organization that did not act {{in the best interests}} of service members." [...] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) subsequently concluded that First Command [...] "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud." [...] In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed [...] "systematic plans" [...] which had very high sales charges termed [...] "front-end sales loads", [...] "by, in part, making <b>misleading</b> statements and <b>omissions</b> concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan." [...] In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.|$|R
40|$|Viatical {{settlements}} are {{a form of}} asset-backed security where a terminally-ill policyholder, {{known as}} a viator, sells the right to receive the proceeds {{of his or her}} life insurance policy to an investor. During his or her lifetime, the policyholder is paid an estimation of the present value of the death benefits under the policy. Viatical settlements are legal and serve a benevolent purpose. However, beyond the altruism of providing funds to the terminally ill, and the legalities of simply selling the right to receive life insurance proceeds to someone other than the insured, viatical settlements pose other legal and ethical issues. Because viatical settlements have not yet been classified as investment contracts, and thus securities for purposes of the federal securities laws, investors in viatical settlements must gather information themselves on which to base their investment decisions. Furthermore, investors are denied the protections and remedies provided by the federal securities laws, and have only a common law fraud remedy to redress <b>misleading</b> statements or <b>omissions</b> by viatical settlement firms. The specter of conflicts of interest, confidentiality problems, and the serious threat of fraud looms over the viatical settlement industry, {{and in the absence of}} appropriate regulation, threatens the very stability of this compassionate and increasingly popular financial innovation. The sale of fractional interests in viatical settlements is currently not subject to meaningful regulation at either the state or federal level. The legislative intent of the federal securities laws was to prevent fraud through the disclosure of information necessary to make meaningful investment decisions. The potential for fraud in this developing industry is high, and there is no mandatory disclosure to investors. Because fractional interests in life insurance policies constitute investment contracts, investors therein should be granted the protection of the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Part I of this Article presents an overview of the evolution of the viatical settlement industry. Part II of this Article raises the ethical issues imbedded in viatical settlement transactions, including conflicts of interest, confidentiality concerns, and fraud, all of which should be disclosed as risk factors to investors in viatical settlements. Part III of this Article considers the classification of viatical settlements as securities for purposes of the Securities Laws. Part III examines the legislative history and case law interpreting the Securities Laws, critiquing the holding in Life Partners that fractional interests in pools of viatical settlements do not constitute securities as defined in the Securities Act and its interpretive case law. Part III concludes that fractional interests in viatical settlements fall within both the spirit and the letter of the Securities Laws, and thus should be considered securities in order to further the legislative goals of the Securities Laws. Part IV of this Article explores the viatical settlement industry after Life Partners, focusing on the efforts of some states to classify certain forms of viatical settlements as securities, and the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s continued efforts to achieve the investor protection denied by the court in Life Partners...|$|R
