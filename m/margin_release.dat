50|$|The {{shape of}} the flat slab is {{constrained}} through earthquakes within the subducting slab and the interface between the upper plate and the subducting slab. Flat slab zones along the Andean <b>margin</b> <b>release</b> 3-5 times more energy through upper plate earthquakes than adjacent, more steeply dipping subduction zones. Upper plate earthquake focal mechanisms indicate that stress is aligned parallel with motion of the plate, and that stress is transmitted high into the upper plate from the lower. The reason for this enhanced seismicity is more effective coupling of {{the upper and lower}} plates. In normal subduction zones the coupling interface, the area in which the two plates are in close proximity, between the two plates is ~100-200 km long, but in flat slab subduction zones the coupling interface is much longer, 400-500 km. Although the lower lithosphere of the upper deforms plastically, numerical modeling has shown stress can be transmitted to crustal regions which behave in a brittle fashion. Along the subducting plate seismicity is more variable, especially intermediate-depth earthquakes. The variability may be controlled by the thickness of the crust and how efficiently it can release water. Thick crust that is not as deeply fractured by trench rise normal faulting may not dehydrate rapidly enough to induce intermediate-depth earthquakes. The Peruvian flat slab lacks significant intermediate-depth earthquakes and is associated with the subduction of the ~17 km thick Nazca Ridge.|$|E

We have, investigated the properties of uptake and intracellular localization of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides in cultured human keratinocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Uptake is primarily nuclear and unaltered by sodium azide, monensin, or chloroquin pretreatment. We have verified our results with two different fluorophores, fluorescein and Bodipy, and found similar uptake and distribution patterns in both live and fixed cell populations. Surprisingly, we have found uptake to be heterogeneous within a population, with 15 - 30 % of cells internalizing the oligonucleotides.

40|$|The 25 -year-old command-and-control {{environmental}} {{regulatory structure}} in the US has resulted in significant environmental improvements. Recently, however, its limitations (e. g., rigid application regardless of site-specific conditions, disregard of cross-media and multimedia impacts, limited incentives for new technology development and use) have become increasingly apparent. New regulatory approaches that recognize current and anticipated economic constraints, new knowledge of environmental processes and impacts, {{and the benefits of}} new technologies are needed. Such approaches could be especially important for the US petroleum refining industry. This industry operates under thin profit <b>margins,</b> <b>releases</b> chemicals that can produce adverse health and environmental impacts, and must meet the technological challenges of producing more highly refined fuels from poorer quality feedstocks. Under a grant from the Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI), Argonne National Laboratory and its subcontractor, Analytical Services, Inc. developed two alternative environmental regulatory programs for next-generation petroleum refineries. (In this report, next-generation refineries refers to the refineries of today as they operate in the next 20 or more years rather than to fully reengineered future refineries.) The objective of the ETI refinery project was to develop future-oriented regulatory programs for next-generation refineries that will expand the use of innovative technologies, encourage pollution prevention, demonstrate environmental responsibility, and maintain refinery economic performance. Rather than suggesting targeted, short-term modifications to existing media-specific command-and-control regulations, the ETI project suggests the use of new approaches that are broader and more flexible. It recognizes that giving refineries flexibility in meeting environmental protection goals can stimulate new technology development and use. Unlike most US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reinvention efforts, which seek results in 12 to 18 months, this ETI effort assumes a time frame of 20 years or more. It also assumes that existing laws and regulations can be changed. An iterative and interactive process was used by the project team to develop the alternative approaches. Information and stakeholder input were integrated to provide for constant revision and improvement. First, guidelines and principles were established to bound the study and set parameters for developing the approaches. Next, existing and projected environmental laws and regulations affecting petroleum refineries were examined to identify areas needing change. Then, to understand future challenges and opportunities, the projected refinery operating environment was described in terms of feedstock, product, technology, and economics. Finally several goals and indicators for assessing and comparing the alternatives were identified. On the basis of this background information, more than 60 options that could efficiently and effectively protect {{human health and the environment}} were identified. These options ranged from fundamental changes in program philosophy to procedural improvements. After the options were evaluated against the goals and indicators, many of them were integrated into two separate thematic paradigms: a risk-based paradigm and a goal-based paradigm. Elements common to both approaches include the following: (1) Establish the baseline [...] In establishing the baseline, the refinery and the regulator jointly identify residuals for which release limits must be established; (2) Set residual release limits [...] The refinery and the regulator jointly specify release limits on a facility-wide rather than a source-specific basis. A facility-wide permit documents the release limits; and (3) Assure compliance [...] Incentives provide the basis for assuring compliance, and flexibility in the compliance method is encouraged. Penalties apply if releases exceed the limits, and reporting requirements are streamlined relative to current practices...|$|R
40|$|Closed access. Uranium series dating {{has been}} carried out on {{secondary}} uranyl silicate minerals formed during sub-glacial and post-glacial weathering of Proterozoic uraninite ores in south west Finland. The samples were obtained from two sites adjacent to the Salpauselkä III ice marginal formation and cover a range of depths, from the surface to more than 60 m. Measured ages fall into three distinct groups, 70 – 100 ka, 28 – 36 ka and < 2500 yr. The youngest set is associated with surface exposures and the crystals display clear evidence of re-working. The most likely trigger for uranium release at depths below the surface weathering zone is intrusion of oxidising glacial melt water. The latter is often characterised by very high discharge rates along channels, which close once the overpressure generated at the ice <b>margin</b> is <b>released.</b> There is excellent correspondence between the two Finnish sites and published data for similar deposits over a large area of southern and central Sweden. None of the seventy samples analysed gave a U–Th age between 40 and 70 ka; a second hiatus is apparent at 20 ka, coinciding with the Last Glacial Maximum. Thus, the process responsible for uranyl silicate formation was halted for significant periods, owing to a change in geochemical conditions or the hydrogeological regime. These data support the presence of interstadial conditions during the Early and Middle Weichselian since in the absence of major climatic perturbations the uranium phases at depth are stable.

However, {{there is a strong}} indication that robust Mφ inflammatory responses may be causal for the fibrotic response always accompanying adult wound healing. Using a complementary approach of in vitro and in vivo studies, we here addressed the question of whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) —due to their anti-inflammatory properties—would control Mφ activation and tissue fibrosis in a murine model of full-thickness skin wounds. We have shown that the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) -stimulated protein 6 (TSG- 6) released from MSCs in co-culture with activated Mφ or following injection into wound <b>margins</b> suppressed the <b>release</b> of TNF-α from activated Mφ and concomitantly induced a switch from a high to an anti-fibrotic low transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) /TGF-β 3 ratio.

MSC-released TSG- 6 was identified to improve wound healing by limiting Mφ activation, inflammation, and fibrosis. TSG- 6 and MSC-based therapies may thus qualify as promising strategies to enhance tissue repair and to prevent excessive tissue fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|The western {{ablation}} {{zone of the}} Greenland {{ice sheet}} contains a region that is darker than the surrounding ice. This region is several tens of kilometres wide and stretched parallel to {{the margin of the}} ice sheet for more than 350 kilometres. The dark appearance implies low radiance and therefore low spectral albedos, leading to enhanced melting. An estimation of the influence of this dark region with a simple model shows that it can increase the local melt rate in this area by several tens per cent. Therefore, this dark region can significantly affect the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. Satellite images reveal that the dark region is caused by outcropping layers of ice that contain more dust than the brighter surrounding ice. This dust was initially deposited in the accumulation zone of the Greenland ice sheet, transported through the ice sheet towards the <b>margin</b> and <b>released</b> in the ablation zone. Geochemical analyses of dust from the dark region and dust from brighter reference ice confirm this hypothesis and indicate a local source for the dust, probably the nearby tundra. In addition, abundant microorganisms were observed in the dark region. Part of these organisms formed granules together with the mineral dust. As the organic matter in the dust is known to have a high light absorbency, the dark region is not only caused by dust from the outcropping ice, but biological processes also contribute to the darkening of the surface. Finally, carbonaceous particles in the ice from the dark region reveal that the material is not modern, and settled on the accumulation zone during the Holocene, during periods of enhanced eolian activity. Therefore, dust fluxes towards the ice sheet in the past contribute to albedo variations in the ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet at present and can enhance the melting of the Greenland ice sheet without external forcing...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the serial, Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] Men's Artistic Gymnastics the current trend in elite high bar dismounts is to perform two somersaults in an extended body shape {{with a number of}} twists. Two techniques have been identified in the backward giant circles leading up to release for these dismounts (J. Biomech. 32 (1999) 811). At the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games 95 % of gymnasts used the “scooped” backward giant circle technique rather than the “traditional” technique. It was speculated that the advantage gained from the scooped technique was an increased margin for error when releasing the high bar. A four segment planar simulation model of the gymnast and high bar was used to determine the margin for error when releasing the bar in performances at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The eight high bar finalists and the three gymnasts who used the traditional backward giant circle technique were chosen for analysis. Model parameters were optimised to obtain a close match between simulated and actual performances in terms of rotation angle (1. 2 °), bar displacements (0. 014 m) and release velocities (2 %). Each matching simulation was used to determine the time window around the actual point of release for which the model had appropriate release parameters to complete the dismount successfully.

40|$|Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) that {{impinge on}} {{continental}} <b>margins</b> favor the <b>release</b> of phosphorus (P) from the sediments {{to the water}} column, enhancing primary productivity and the maintenance or expansion of low-oxygen waters. A comprehensive field program in the Peruvian OMZ was undertaken to identify the sources of benthic P at six stations, including the analysis of particles from the water column, surface sediments, and pore fluids, {{as well as in}} situ benthic flux measurements. A major fraction of solid-phase P was bound as particulate inorganic P (PIP) both in the water column and in sediments. Sedimentary PIP increased with depth in the sediment at the expense of particulate organic P (POP). The ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to POP exceeded the Redfield ratio both in the water column (202 ± 29) and in surface sediments (303 ± 77). However, the POC to total particulate P (TPP = POP + PIP) ratio was close to Redfield in the water column (103 ± 9) and in sediment samples (102 ± 15). This suggests that the relative burial efficiencies of POC and TPP are similar under low-oxygen conditions and that the sediments underlying the anoxic waters on the Peru margin are not depleted in P compared to Redfield. Benthic fluxes of dissolved P were extremely high (up to 1. 04 ± 0. 31 mmol m − 2 d − 1), however, showing that a lack of oxygen promotes the intensified release of dissolved P from sediments, whilst preserving the POC / TPP burial ratio. Benthic dissolved P fluxes were always higher than the TPP rain rate to the seabed, which is proposed to be caused by transient P release by bacterial mats that had stored P during previous periods when bottom waters were less reducing. At one station located at the lower rim of the OMZ, dissolved P was taken up by the sediments, indicating ongoing phosphorite formation. This is further supported by decreasing porewater phosphate concentrations with sediment depth, whereas solid-phase P concentrations were comparatively high...|$|R
40|$|The Coast Ranges of the Cascadia margin are {{overriding}} the subducted Juan de Fuca/Gorda plate. We {{investigate the}} extent to which the latitudinal change in attributes related to the subduction process. These attributes include the varibale age of the subducted slab that underlies the Coast Ranges and average vertical crustal velocities of the western margin of the Coast Rnages for two markedly different time periods, the last 45 years and the last 100 kyr. These vertical crustal velocities are computed from the resurveying of highway bech marks and from the present elevation of shore platforms that have been uplifted in the late Quaternary, respectively. Topogarphy of the Coast Ranges is in part a function of the age and bouyancy of the underlying subducted plate. This is evident in the fact that the two highest topographic elements of the Coast Rnages, the Klamath Mountains and the Olympic Mountains, are underlain by youngest subducted oceanic crust. The subducted Blanco Fracture Zone in southernmost Oregon is responsible for an age discontinuity of subducted crust under the Klamath Mountains. The norhtern terminus of hte topographically higher Klamaths is offset to the north relative to the position of the underlying Blanco Fracture Zone, teh offset being in the direction of migration of the farcture zone, as dictated by relative plate motions. Vertical crustal velocities at the coast, derived from becnh mark surveys, are as much as an order of magnitude greater than vertical crustal velocities derived from uplifted shore platforms. This uplift rate discrepancy indicates that strain is accumulating on the plate <b>margin,</b> to be <b>released</b> during the next interplate earthquake. In a latitudinal sense, average Coast Rnage topography is relatively high where bench mark-derived, short-term vertical crustal velocities are highest. Becuase the shore platform vertical crustal velocities reflect longer-term, premanent uplift, we infer that a small percentage of the interseismic strain that accumulates as rapid short-term uplift is not recovered by subduction earthquakes but rather contributes to rock uplift of the Coast Ranges. The conjecture that permanent rock uplift is related to interseismic uplift is consistent with the observation that those segments of the subduction zone subject to greater interseismic uplift rates are at approximately the same latitudes as those segments of the Coast Ranges that have higher magnitudes of rock uplift over the long term...|$|R
40|$|The Earth {{experienced}} a severe mass extinction at the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) about 252 million years ago. This biological catastrophe {{was accompanied by}} major changes in geochemical composition of the atmosphere and ocean {{and the appearance of}} sedimentary features which had not occurred since the Precambrian time. The eruption of the largest continental flood basalt, the Siberian Traps, overlapped this mass killing. Many hypotheses have been proposed but no definitive conclusion currently exits. Here we present characteristics of three sections from Iran and China and propose that an active mantle plume initiated a series of processes which led to the mass mortality and produced major sedimentological, mineralogical, and geochemical changes observed in the transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic. The injection of mantle plume-related igneous dike swarms into the continental <b>margin</b> facilitated the <b>release</b> of massive amounts of CH_ 4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates and secondarily from the maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The bulk of the CH_ 4 was aerobically oxidized in the water column producing dissolved CO_ 2 with low δ^(13) C values. This CO_ 2 -saturated seawater became acidic to the point of dissolution of shelf carbonates promoting precipitation of siliciclastic-rich strata in the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. Methane-derived CO_ 2 also lowered carbon isotopic composition of seawater leading to the observed decline in δ^(13) C composition of organic and inorganic marine carbon at the PTB. Gas-charged oceans released large volumes of CO_ 2 and CH_ 4 into the atmosphere which created a severe global warming (the end-Permian inferno) causing the release of additional CH_ 4 from the dissociation of polar gas hydrates. These events lowered δ^(13) C compositions of terrestrial carbon. Simultaneously, feeder dikes from the mantle plume formed the Siberian Traps flood basalt. Marine mass extinction {{was the result of a}} change in seawater composition due to the injection and oxidation of CH_ 4 in the water column causing low pH, high concentrations of CO_ 2, Ca^(2 +) and HCO_ 3 −, and low CO_ 3 ^(2 −) values. Combined with a hot seawater temperature, these changes made calcification of marine organisms difficult and produced major physiological crisis including reduced metabolic rates, high sensitivity to environmental stress, and hampered growth and reproduction. Terrestrial mass extinction can be attributed to severe global warming and soil acidification produced by increased atmospheric CO_ 2, acid rain that was generated by SO_ 2 derived from the Siberian trap eruption, and loss of habitat. Cessation of the plume activity during Early Triassic stopped the release of CH_ 4 into the ocean and terminated continental flood basalt eruption ending the environment of death on land and in sea. The cut off of CO_ 2 production in the ocean instantly increased carbonate saturation of seawater resulting in extensive seafloor cementation. It also resulted in the deposition of marine carbonates by microbial activities in the hostile post-extinction environment. From the trigger to recovery, the perturbation which included the end-Permian mass mortality could have lasted for at least 2 Myr. Several major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic are temporally accompanied by flood basalt eruptions. So far, these two events have been interpreted in a cause-and-effect relation: flood basalt eruption causes mass extinction. This study proposes that flood basalts and their time correlative biological crises are themselves the consequence of a complex perturbation caused by mantle plume activities. If so, major disturbances in the near surface of the Earth are ultimately controlled by changes in the mantle. The physical sedimentological observations presented here combined with previous paleontological evidence cast doubt on other interpretations which use geochemical variables, numerical modeling, biomarkers, and Ce anomaly to suggest that Late Permian ocean was anoxic all the way to the photic zone...|$|R
