5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was a great deal}} more sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that it is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E
5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat half-cup mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults incubate the two to four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E

5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule does not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team {{composed}} {{mainly of}} factory workers, {{became the first}} Northern team to win the FA Cup, {{and the next year}} Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is less of a North–South rivalry than in some other sports.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

5000|$|Lulu {{operators}} have {{a number}} of attractive mathematical properties, among them idempotence - meaning that repeated application of the operator yields the same result as a single application - and co-idempotence. An interpretation of idempotence is that: 'Idempotence <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no “noise” left in the smoothed data and co-idempotence <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no “signal” left in the residual.' ...|$|R

25|$|Amsterdam is {{much younger}} than Dutch cities such as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In October 2008, {{historical}} geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed {{as early as the}} late 10th century.

25|$|Could the {{woodland}} {{have survived}} {{this level of}} industrial use? The two resources that the Romans needed were ironstone and fuel. With both available on one site, this would make it an attractive location, but to ensure continuity of fuel supply, it would seem most likely that they encouraged re-growth through a coppice-style system. That would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was continuity of woodland trees and habitats throughout and after the Roman period, and possibly since the ice receded.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the {{collateral}} line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture.

25|$|In the {{toolmakers}} paradigm, {{words do}} not contain ideas, so POEM1 cannot contain POEM2; therefore, a distinction between them must be preserved.

25|$|Significant {{problems}} are {{also associated with}} storm water management, with large amounts of sediment being deposited on Coffee Creak, {{on the western side}} of the Conservation Area. This deposition damages native vegetation and habitat. These impacts also <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are indirect considerations involving development upstream of the Conservation Area. For example, development upstream and adjacent to Coffee Creek, on the Conservation Area's western side, could detrimentally effect the Conservation Area and its associated reserves. Local water courses are particularly sensitive to pollution and sedimentation.|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{is quick}} to assert that the focus on “production” does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be an {{increase}} in production and labor under Eco-socialism. He thinks that the emancipation of labor and the realization of use-value will allow “the spheres of work and culture to be reintegrated”. He cites the example of Paraguayan Indian communities (organised by Jesuits) in the 18th century who made sure that all community members learned musical instruments, and had labourers take musical instruments to the fields and takes turns playing music or harvesting.|$|E
