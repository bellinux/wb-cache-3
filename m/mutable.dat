5|$|For Halo 3, it {{was decided}} a new visual {{language}} for the Flood was needed. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. With the addition of <b>mutable</b> forms in Halo 3, the only fictional constraint on the designer's imaginations was that the Flood altered the DNA of its victims by digesting.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, <b>mutable</b> views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's (384–322BC) {{description}} of the universe, the Moon marked {{the boundary between the}} spheres of the <b>mutable</b> elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries. However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance. These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy (90–168AD): his values of a mean distance of 59times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively. Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Renowned as Batman's {{greatest}} enemy, the Joker {{is known}} {{by a number}} of nicknames, including the Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate, and the Ace of Knaves. During the evolution of the DC Universe, interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two forms. The original, dominant image is that of an extreme psychopath, with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor. The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief. Like other long-lived characters, the Joker's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, however unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense, more than any other comic book character, the Joker thrives on his <b>mutable</b> and irreconcilable identities. The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and spats on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series The Batman placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.|$|E
25|$|Mutable: The <b>mutable</b> {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly <b>mutable</b> signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. <b>Mutable</b> people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, <b>mutable</b> subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking <b>mutable</b> signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of the ligands is fixed for a given complex, {{but in some cases}} it is <b>mutable</b> by a reaction that forms another stable isomer.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to how {{signs are}} {{classified}} {{according to a}}strological modality (Cardinal, Fixed and <b>Mutable),</b> houses are classified, according to a mode of expression, as Angular, Succedent and Cadent.|$|E
25|$|Git has two data structures: a <b>mutable</b> index (also called {{stage or}} cache) that caches {{information}} about the working directory and the next revision to be committed; and an immutable, append-only object database.|$|E
25|$|Cadent houses : These are the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses. Planets {{in these}} houses {{have a lot}} to do with the subject {{developing}} their own unique talents and aptitudes; and may compensate for a lack of <b>mutable</b> signs, and general adaptability in the chart.|$|E
25|$|Self-evaluating {{forms and}} quoted forms are Lisp's {{equivalent}} of literals. It {{may be possible}} to modify the values of (<b>mutable)</b> literals in program code. For instance, if a function returns a quoted form, and the code that calls the function modifies the form, this may alter the behavior of the function on subsequent iterations.|$|E
25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the signs}} of the zodiac are {{believed}} to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve signs are divided into four elements fire, earth, air and water. Fire and air signs are considered masculine, while water and earth signs are considered feminine. The twelve signs are also divided into three qualities, Cardinal, fixed and <b>mutable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of OpenGL's {{use of a}} state system, objects must be <b>mutable.</b> That is, {{the basic}} {{structure}} of an object can change at any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using that object. A texture object can be redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degree of complexity to internal object management.|$|E
25|$|Some sociologists {{consider}} the higher income and prestige of higher ranked jobs to simply be incentives to encourage {{members of society}} to obtain {{the skills necessary to}} perform important work. This is an important mechanism in the economic theory of capitalism, and is compatible with the notion that class is <b>mutable</b> and determined by a combination of choices and opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Belief in {{guardian}} {{spirits and}} shape shifting, or transformation between {{human and animal}} spirits were widely shared in myriad forms. The relations of soul or souls, and conceptions of the lands of {{the living and the}} dead, were complex and <b>mutable.</b> Vision quest journeys involving other states of consciousness were varied and widely practiced. The Duwamish had a soul recovery and journey ceremony and legends.|$|E
25|$|A state monad {{allows a}} {{programmer}} to attach state information {{of any type}} to a calculation. Given any value type, the corresponding type in the state monad is a function which accepts a state, then outputs a new state (of type s) along with a return value (of type t). This is similar to an environment monad, except that it also return a new state, and thus allows modeling a <b>mutable</b> environment.|$|E
25|$|We {{know from}} Plutarch that Xenocrates, {{if he did}} not explain the Platonic {{construction}} of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the Timaeus; and further that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give us any further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number. Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (monas and duas) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the <b>mutable</b> world under heaven, or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the <b>mutable,</b> sublunary world, the last, or outermost.|$|E
25|$|The {{organizational}} {{structure of the}} ICRC is not well understood by outsiders. This is partly because of organizational secrecy, {{but also because the}} structure itself is highly <b>mutable</b> and has been prone to change. The Assembly and Presidency are two long-standing institutions, but the Assembly Council and Directorate were created only {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. Decisions are often made in a collective way, so authority and power relationships are not set in stone. Today, the leading organs are the Directorate and the Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian case endings are {{somewhat}} different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian na pervom etaže 'on the first floor' {{is in the}} locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is na peršomu poversi (на першому поверсі). -omu is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in -im are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The kh of Ukrainian poverkh (поверх) has mutated into s {{under the influence of}} the soft vowel i (k is similarly <b>mutable</b> into c in final positions).|$|E
25|$|Each {{barangay}} had a <b>mutable</b> caste system, {{with any}} sub-classes varying from one barangay to the next. Generally, patriarchal lords and kings were called datus and rajas, while the mahárlika were the nobility and the timawa were freedmen. The alipin or servile class were {{dependent on the}} upper classes, an arrangement misconstrued as slavery by the Spaniards. Intermarriage between the timawa and the alipin was permitted, which created a more complex, but flexible system of land privileges and labour services. The Spaniards attempted to suppress this class system based on their misconception that the dependent, servile class were an oppressed group. Although they failed at completely abolishing the system, they instead worked {{to use it to}} their own advantage.|$|E
25|$|Athos is {{attacked}} by a Dead droid, which he kills with his scalpel and flees. He returns to his village, where he again encourages Fist and Broken Leg who unite and travel to the base at Devils Crag. Athos now understands that the villages will disappear because of Overcoming (the process led by the Glorious Helpmates) and wants to prevent this mass murder. Broken Leg does not want Athos to go since he believes Athos will die. In the entire section of the novel, there is almost not a single object iⱱn the forest {{that is not a}} <b>mutable</b> living thing. One can grow clothing from the forest, eat the ground itself as a meal, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptist Lamarck, a gradualist and {{colleague}} of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms {{as evidence of}} the <b>mutable</b> character of species. While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change. Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that {{the surface of the earth}} was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{explores the}} <b>mutable</b> nature {{of art and}} {{identity}} through sculptures, works on paper, photography, and books. She describes drawing as the key activity in all her work because drawing is about composing relationships. Horn’s drawings concentrate on the materiality of the objects depicted. She also uses words {{as the basis for}} drawings and other works. Horn crafts complex relationships between the viewer and her work by installing a single piece on opposing walls, in adjoining rooms, or throughout a series of buildings. She subverts the notion of ‘identical experience’, insisting that one’s sense of self is marked by a place in the here-and-there, and by time in the now-and-then. She describes her artworks as site-dependent, expanding upon the idea of site-specificity associated with Minimalism. Horn’s work also embodies the cyclical relationship between humankind and nature—a mirror-like relationship in which we attempt to remake nature in our own image.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} {{there is no}} clear {{majority}} in either element or quality to give a clear signature. In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart (alternatively, the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included). Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality. So for example, if the Sun is in Taurus, its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign. If Venus is in, say, Pisces, then an additional 'casting vote' is given to the element water and quality <b>mutable.</b> This is usually enough to provide a signature. A 'casting vote' is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart. The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers who use it as frequently having an over-riding influence in the natal chart, irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies.|$|E
25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and are able to do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on <b>mutable</b> signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
500|$|Between 1948 and 1950, she {{developed}} a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to Dissociator and Activator as [...] "controlling units"—later, as [...] "controlling elements"—to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function. McClintock's discovery challenged {{the concept of}} the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations. In 1950, she reported her work on Ac/Ds and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled [...] "The origin and behavior of <b>mutable</b> loci in maize" [...] published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In summer 1951, she reported her work on the origin and behavior of <b>mutable</b> loci in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, presenting a paper of the same name. The paper delved into the instability caused by Dc and As or just As in four genes, along with the tendency of those genes to unpredictably revert to the wild phenotype. She also identified [...] "families" [...] of transposons, which did not interact with one another.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is <b>mutable.</b> I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|Python makes a {{distinction}} between lists and tuples. Lists are written as , are <b>mutable,</b> and cannot {{be used as the}} keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively [...] "modifying the contents" [...] of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.|$|E
500|$|George Rousseau, similarly, {{cites the}} {{pamphlet}} {{as part of}} a body of 1740s [...] "sodomy" [...] literature so wide-ranging as to suggest that the term's meaning might have been <b>mutable,</b> broad, and vague. He argues specifically that, in the 1740s, the term had a strong connotation of an imported vice; it was often used in the 1740s to connote suspicion against foreigners. The pamphlet's text, on page 50, includes the strident claim [...] "Damn'd Fashion! Imported from Italy amid'st a Train of other unnatural Vices. Have we not Sins enough of our own, but we must eke 'em out with those of Foreign Nations, to fill up the Cup of our Abominations, and make us yet more ripe for Divine Vengeance?" [...] The plausibility of the theory that [...] "sodomy", however understood, was particularly prevalent in Italy is difficult to assess, though Trevor Dean notes that, earlier, seventeenth-century Italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|The Greek {{mythology of}} the sea {{includes}} a complex pantheon of gods and other supernatural creatures. The god {{of the sea}}, Poseidon, is accompanied by his wife, Amphitrite, {{who is one of}} the fifty Nereids, sea nymphs whose parents were Nereus and Doris. The Tritons, sons of Poseidon, who were variously represented with the tails of fish or seahorses, formed Poseidon's retinue along with the Nereids. The mythic sea was further peopled by dangerous sea monsters such as Scylla. Poseidon himself had something of the shifting character of the sea, presiding not only over the sea, but also earthquakes, storms and horses. Neptune occupied a similar position in Roman mythology. Another Greek sea-god, Proteus, specifically embodies the domain of sea change, the adjectival form [...] "protean" [...] meaning <b>mutable,</b> able to assume many forms. Shakespeare makes use of this in Henry VI, Part 3, where Richard III boasts [...] "I can add colors to the chameleon, Change shapes with Proteus for advantages".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{disagree}} on whether discernible characters exist in Finnegans Wake. For example, Grace Eckley argues that Wakean characters are distinct from each other, and defends this with explaining the dual narrators, the [...] "us" [...] {{of the first}} paragraph, as well as Shem-Shaun distinctions while Margot Norris argues that the [...] "haracters are fluid and interchangeable". Supporting the latter stance, Van Hulle finds that the [...] "characters" [...] in Finnegans Wake are rather [...] "archetypes or character amalgams, taking different shapes", and Riquelme similarly refers to the book's cast of <b>mutable</b> characters as [...] "protean". As early as in 1934, {{in response to the}} recently published excerpt [...] "The Mookse and the Gripes", Ronald Symond argued that [...] "the characters in Work in Progress, in keeping with the space-time chaos in which they live, change identity at will. At one time they are persons, at another rivers or stones or trees, at another personifications of an idea, at another they are lost and hidden in the actual texture of the prose, with an ingenuity far surpassing that of crossword puzzles." [...] Such concealment of character identity has resulted in some disparity as to how critics identify the book's main protagonists; for example, while most find consensus that Festy King, who appears on trial in I.4, is a HCE type, not all analysts agree on this – for example Anthony Burgess believes him to be Shaun.|$|E
500|$|The Flood {{reappear}} in the Halo 3 mission [...] "Floodgate", {{on board}} a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo. While the infestation of Earth is prevented by the cauterisation of the only site of outbreak, in the East African continent, Gravemind follows Master Chief and his allies to the Ark aboard the infested High Charity. Though the Master Chief and Arbiter form a tenuous alliance with the Flood to stop the activation of all the Halo rings, {{as soon as the}} firing sequence is stopped Gravemind turns on them. The Master Chief fights his way to the center of High Charity, freeing Cortana and destroying the city, but Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on the ring under construction by the Ark. Realizing that lighting the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation and spare the galaxy, the Master Chief, Arbiter, Cortana and Sergeant Johnson proceed to Halo's control room, activate the ring, and escape. However, because the ring is unfinished, the firing causes it to destroy itself, damaging the Ark in the process. In his presumed final moments, the Gravemind telepathically addresses the Master Chief and the Arbiter, warning them that his defeat will only delay the Flood's goal of consuming all sentient life. Halo3 added new capabilities to the Flood, including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time. The Flood are also seen to produce a <b>mutable</b> [...] "pure form" [...] which can mutate into several other Flood types.|$|E
500|$|According to Dan Crane of The New York Times, [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] was {{the music}} video that {{garnered}} {{the most attention}} following the release of Beyoncé. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani commented that the song sounded more [...] "immersive" [...] accompanied by its music video. Similarly, NMEs Emily Mackay who gave a mixed review for the song, felt that its visual [...] " [...] the day", and deemed the scene where Beyoncé wrecks her trophy shelf as [...] "powerful". Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the video [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "touching," [...] wrote that the [...] "shots of her bashing her trophy shelf prove way more cathartic than any pageant victory". Kitty Empire of The Observer commented that the video contained perspective in the scenes depicting [...] "painful depilating, pill-popping and toilet-hugging details". Vanity writer Michelle Collins felt that the singer managed to make exercising look difficult and uncomfortable, and praised the scene where Beyoncé responds to the pageant judge questioning her life aspirations. Spins Philip Sherburne alluded that the video was emotional and wrote that it offered [...] "a story line that opens up a wealth of readings about race, skin tone, beauty standards, and her [...] own <b>mutable</b> image." [...] Whitney Phaneuf from the website HitFix praised Beyoncé's acting in the video and added that the vulnerability in the character she portrayed was [...] "palpable". Phaneuf went on to opine that the footage of Beyoncé competing in a talent show as a child made the clip look more realistic. Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! wrote that the video allowed Beyoncé to showcase her acting abilities. The editors of Out magazine likened the clip to the films Magic Mike (2012) and American Hustle (2013).|$|E
2500|$|On the band's website Scott {{described}} the arrangements as [...] "psychedelic, intense, kaleidescopic, {{a mix of}} rock, folk and faery music," [...] the delivery of which signals yet another musical shift in the ever <b>mutable</b> world of The Waterboys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{placement}} of Arcturus {{has also been}} <b>mutable</b> through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him. However, Germanicus Caesar deviated from this tradition by placing Arcturus [...] "where his garment is fastened by a knot".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", the Tenth Doctor {{says that}} as a Time Lord, he can see both fixed and <b>mutable</b> points in time. The Twelfth Doctor {{says the same thing}} here, but that there are [...] "grey areas", points in time for which he cannot see the outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Viewed {{in terms}} of {{psychology}} rather than allegory, the tale of Cupid and Psyche shows how [...] "a <b>mutable</b> person … matures within the social constructs of family and marriage". In the Jungian allegory of Erich Neumann (1956), the story of Psyche was interpreted as [...] "the psychic development of the feminine".|$|E
