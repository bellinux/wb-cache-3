50|$|Meanwhile, a small lab {{team was}} {{borrowing}} 914 copiers and modifying them. The lab was developing {{what it called}} long distance xerography (LDX) to connect two copiers using the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964. Many years later this work came to fruition in the Xerox telecopiers, seminal to today's fax machines. The fax operation in today's <b>multifunction</b> <b>copiers</b> is true to Carlson's original vision for these devices.|$|R
40|$|Hewlett Packard {{recently}} released a new security patch to fix an authentication bypass vulnerability in specific network printers. The Enterprise Security Office is using {{this opportunity to}} remind agencies {{of the importance of}} securing network printers in general. Network printers are frequently overlooked when securing office networks; sometimes left with default configurations and not patched, they represent a risk to the office network environment. Network based printers are much more than just a print device. They typically have full operating systems, hard drives, and a full complement of communication services. Built-in services such as ftp, tftp, e-mail, web server, and snmp are increasingly the target of choice for hackers wanting to remain undetected and to gain a foothold in the office network. Because network printer devices are frequently left unsecured with default passwords and utilizing factory default settings they are easy targets. Example attacks against printers include bridging between networks (i. e wireless to LAN or vice-versa), sniffing network traffic to steal sensitive data, redirection and spoofing of network traffic, malware distribution and email spam generation. Applicable Devices: All network printing devices, <b>multifunction</b> <b>copiers,</b> and network based fax machines...|$|R

5000|$|Compatible ink is {{manufactured}} {{for several}} types of machines including fax machines, laser printers, inkjet printers, <b>multifunction</b> printers, and <b>copiers.</b> Aside from compatible products, three other sources of consumables are also available to supply these machines, including OEM brand ink and toner, remanufactured toner and ink cartridges, and refilled ink and toner cartridges. Compatible ink manufacturers differentiate their product by using all new parts, whereas other ink replacements recycle used OEM parts.. Compatible ink and toner products tend to offer greater value than original, genuine OEM ink and toner cartridges. Reducing cost for the end user, ink and toner manufactured by third party manufacturers is classified as compatible when consisting of new parts for a third party printer.|$|R
