Tutu has often spoken {{in support of the}} Basic Income Grant (BIG) which has so far been defeated in parliament. After the first round of volleys were fired, South African Press Association journalist, Ben Maclennan reported Tutu's response as: [...] "Thank you Mr President for telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of me, that I am—a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now tell <b>me</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of going}} with him; I mean, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> father {{would say if}} we could consult him, not what {{we would like to}} do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have; {{regularly}} floored; but I 'm up again, and steadier than ever. Just {{you read}} that, and tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said. 'You {{must tell}} <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> later. You know what I mean? Not sloppy emotionalism. An impersonal union that leaves one free.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Marian, not a word. Tell me, pray tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it. I don't {{know what}} to think, or what to do next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Something {{will have}} to be done soon. We can’t remain in a state of {{suspended}} expectation for ever. Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of our chances?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{yourself}} about my friend's case--can't you?" [...] said Geoffrey, still holding obstinately {{to the end}} that he had in view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for your}} very equivocal compliments," [...] she returned, {{administering}} a slight box on his ear. [...] "And now tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Fan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of these}} five years, Arnold. Tell me the truth," [...] Mabane persisted. [...] "Let me know if your {{thoughts}} {{are the same as}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt convinced," [...] he said gratefully, [...] "that I {{should not}} make my {{appeal to you}} in vain. Tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of doing with the rest?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] cried Johnson, {{clutching}} at his thick frieze overcoat. [...] "We are {{so glad that}} you have come. And, doctor, please come down soon and let <b>me</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas, for {{you good}} night, and for <b>me,</b> <b>what?</b> Baas, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{too much and}} {{you have nothing to}} do, that is why you grow sick. Better that we should go and dig again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{not on this}} matter, {{which is}} very private to <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> should <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if I went into your house and inquired of you as to those things which were {{particularly}} near to you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My son," [...] said Nazinred, [...] "I {{have one}} or two {{questions}} to put to you. You and I agree about many things. Tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the fawn that would forsake its dam?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{we come to}} my old notions for my sisters. I {{thought they}} would have been governesses like myself, but they married; and now tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of this scheme of Miss Mohun and Agatha?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you take}} it, too? It {{might have been}} a long way round, {{but it would have been}} certain. I've been wanting you here badly. Just tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "For 'Law,' to be sure! When it says 'Law' on the back, open it, {{and look}} inside for Marriage--read {{every word of}} it--and then come here and explain it to <b>me.</b> <b>What!</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> your head is to be trusted to do such a simple thing as that?" ...|$|R
