5|$|Formidables arrival allowed Rawlings {{to order}} Illustrious to the advance base in San Pedro Bay, in the Philippines, for a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> inspection. She arrived on 16 April and the {{examination}} by divers revealed {{that some of}} her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked. The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs, enough {{to allow her to}} reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy had {{conducted}} {{trials in}} 1913 with a modified cruiser, , {{to evaluate the}} ability of seaplanes {{to work with the}} fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> modification than had been possible with Hermes to better accommodate seaplanes. A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.|$|E

50|$|The Intelligence Compensation Theory (a term first {{coined by}} Wood and Englert, 2009) states that {{individuals}} who are comparatively less intelligent work harder, more methodically, become <b>more</b> resolute and <b>thorough</b> (<b>more</b> conscientious) {{in order to achieve}} goals, to compensate for their 'lack of intelligence' whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits/behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort. The theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness, such that the development of the personality trait conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence. This assumption is deemed plausible as {{it is unlikely that the}} reverse causal relationship could occur; implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence (Gf) and conscientiousness. The justification being the timeline of development of Gf, Gc and personality, as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop. Subsequently, during school-going ages, more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence (knowledge) through education, as they would be <b>more</b> efficient, <b>thorough,</b> hard-working and dutiful.|$|R
5|$|With the Red House {{batteries}} out of action, Smyth immediately {{pressed on}} with his invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board.

5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> analysis.|$|E
5|$|HMS Engadine was a {{seaplane}} tender {{which served}} in the Royal Navy (RN) during the First World War. Converted from the cross-Channel packet ship SS Engadine, she was initially fitted with temporary hangars for three seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance and bombing missions in the North Sea. She participated in the unsuccessful Cuxhaven Raid in late 1914 before she began a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> conversion in 1915 that increased her capacity to four aircraft. Engadine {{was transferred to the}} Battle Cruiser Fleet in late 1915 and participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 when one of her aircraft flew the first heavier-than-air reconnaissance mission during a naval battle.

Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July.

Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £275,412. Aside from a brief period when she {{was assigned to the}} 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning, Grenville spent the prewar period as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. She spent ten months deployed off the Spanish coast in the Western Mediterranean during the Spanish Civil War before returning to Portsmouth for a brief overhaul between 24 May and 9 June 1937.

5|$|That conquest was a {{consequence}} of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16BC, a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of}} the hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Code {{coverage}} and mutation score measure how thoroughly tests exercise programs and how effective they are, respectively. The {{objective is to}} provide empirical evidence {{on the impact of}} pair programming on both, thoroughness and effectiveness of test suites, as pair programming {{is considered one of the}} practices that can make testing <b>more</b> rigorous, <b>thorough</b> and effective. A large experiment with MSc students working solo and in pairs was conducted. The subjects were asked to write unit tests using JUnit, and to follow test-driven development approach, as suggested by eXtreme Programming methodology. It appeared that branch coverage, as well as mutation score indicator (the lower bound on mutation score), was not significantly affected by using pair programming, instead of solo programming. However, slight but insignificant positive impact of pair programming on mutations score indicator was noticeable. The results do not support the positive impact of pair programming on testing to make it <b>more</b> effective and <b>thorough.</b> The generalization of the results is limited due to the fact that MSc students participated in the study. It is possible that the benefits of pair programming will exceed the results obtained in this experiment for larger, more complex and longer projects. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} is ready for release, the {{publisher}} sends copies of {{the final version of}} the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> review.
