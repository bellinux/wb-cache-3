5|$|By 01:10 hours, {{the western}} {{flank of the}} <b>Mousetrap</b> had fallen to Viet Minh bombardment. By 01:30, the {{garrison}} was informed that weather conditions prevented air support, and by 02:30 the Viet Minh forces launched successive assault waves which overran Teullier and his men, including attacks which flanked the position using the nearby sandbanks. At the same time, Alpha was overrun by Viet Minh forces, and by 03:50 no more firing was heard from the <b>Mousetrap.</b> Alpha survived {{the remainder of the}} night and was seen fighting by French aircraft at 09:00 that morning. C-47 transport aircraft returned to resume supply drops, however by 12:00 the Tricolor and the Laotian flag had been removed from Pi’s command bunker.|$|E
5|$|One {{accident}} at the <b>Mousetrap,</b> a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the <b>Mousetrap.</b> The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The <b>Mousetrap</b> was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
5|$|A {{bombardment}} from Soviet Russian 120-mm mortars, 57-mm recoilless rifles, {{and phosphorus}} grenades began at 00:30 on May 18. Teullier instructed his radio operator, Sergeant René Novak, to request air-dropped flares and air support, while mortar fire landed on Alpha and the <b>Mousetrap,</b> but not Pi, where Grézy was in command. Pi continued {{to support the}} other two areas of the outpost with its own mortar fire.|$|E

5|$|The Fox Talbot Museum forms part of {{the ground}} floor.

Exhibitions showing the works of various photographers are sometimes held in a gallery on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|The first Colorado {{portion of}} I-70 opened to traffic in 1961. This section {{bypassed}} and linked Idaho Springs to the junction where US6 currently separates from I-70 {{west of the}} city. The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964. The <b>Mousetrap</b> reused some structures that were built in 1951, before {{the formation of the}} Interstate Highway system. The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by his {{performance}} in a West End production of the Agatha Christie murder mystery The <b>Mousetrap,</b> Anderson cast actor Anthony Oliver in the leading role of Police Constable Don Ross. David Graham, who appears as undercover agent Johnny, had starred in a 1957 episode of the TV series Martin Kane, Private Investigator that Anderson had directed. A number of the cast contributed to later Anderson productions: George Murcell (Diamond) provided the voices of Professor Popkiss and Masterspy in the first series of Supercar, while Graham voiced various characters in Stingray and Thunderbirds.|$|E

5|$|Martin Miller, born Rudolph Muller (2 September 1899 26 August 1969) was a Czech-Austrian {{character}} actor who played many small roles in British films and television series {{from the early}} 1940s until his death. He was best known for playing eccentric doctors, scientists and professors, although he played {{a wide range of}} small, obscure rolesincluding photographers, waiters, a pet store dealer, rabbis, a Dutch sailor and a Swiss tailor. On stage he was noted in particular for his parodies of Adolf Hitler and roles as Dr. Einstein in Arsenic and Old Lace and Mr. Paravinci in The <b>Mousetrap.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the <b>Mousetrap.</b> From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{one-time}} use, disposable <b>mousetraps,</b> generally made of inexpensive materials which {{are designed to be}} disposed of after catching a mouse. These <b>mousetraps</b> have similar trapping mechanisms as other traps, however, they generally conceal the dead mouse so it can be disposed of without being sighted. Glue traps are usually considered disposable - discard the trap with the mouse attached.|$|R
50|$|Traps {{are used}} {{as a method of}} pest control as an {{alternative}} to pesticides. Commonly spring traps which holds the animal are used — <b>mousetraps</b> for mice, or the larger rat traps for larger rodents like rats and squirrel. Specific traps are designed for inverterbrates such as cockroaches and spiders. Some <b>mousetraps</b> can also double as an insect or universal trap, like the glue traps which catch any small animal that walks upon them.|$|R

40|$|An {{array of}} <b>mousetraps,</b> each loaded with two Ping-Pong balls, {{is used as}} the classic model of an {{uncontrolled}} nuclear chain reaction, as seen in Figure 1 just as the device is fired. The Ping-Pong balls represent neutrons in the uranium nuclei, which are exemplified by the <b>mousetraps.</b> Under normal circumstances this system is stable. However, when another ball, representing a fast neutron from another source, is thrown into the array, the ball will strike one of the <b>mousetraps,</b> causing it to release its energy and send its two Ping-Pong balls flying rapidly off. These balls strike other <b>mousetraps,</b> which release their energy to their Ping-Pong balls, resulting in a multiplicative effect, as the entire system goes off. This system models nuclear fission. When neutrons strike uranium nuclei, the struck nuclei divide into two smaller nuclei, each of which releases energy and several fast neutrons. These neutrons in turn strike other uranium nuclei, causing them to fission, releasing more energy and fast neutrons. If the amount of uranium available is limited, the device {{can be used as}} a fission reactor to produce heat for an electric generator. If the amount of uranium exceeds the critical mass, the fission reaction proceeds in a rapid and uncontrolled manner, creating a uranium, or atomic, bomb...|$|R
25|$|The {{play was}} written between 1961 and 1962, drawing on Stoppard's {{experiences}} as a Bristol theatre critic. It was initially named The Stand-ins and later, The Critics. It is a parody of the stereotypical parlor mystery {{in the style of}} Agatha Christie's The <b>Mousetrap,</b> {{as well as of the}} critics watching the play, with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews. The title is a direct reference to the ending of The <b>Mousetrap,</b> a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its twist ending, although the producers of Agatha Christie's play could not publicly object without drawing even more attention to the fact.|$|E
