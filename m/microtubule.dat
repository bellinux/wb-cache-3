25|$|The cancer-fighting taxane {{class of}} drugs (paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel) block dynamic {{instability}} by stabilizing GDP-bound tubulin in the <b>microtubule.</b> Thus, even when hydrolysis of GTP reaches {{the tip of}} the <b>microtubule,</b> there is no depolymerization and the <b>microtubule</b> does not shrink back.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} docetaxel is exerted by promoting and stabilising <b>microtubule</b> assembly, while preventing physiological <b>microtubule</b> depolymerisation/disassembly {{in the absence}} of GTP. This leads to a significant decrease in free tubulin, needed for <b>microtubule</b> formation and results in inhibition of mitotic cell division between metaphase and anaphase, preventing further cancer cell progeny.|$|E
25|$|The main mode of {{therapeutic}} action of docetaxel is {{the suppression of}} <b>microtubule</b> dynamic assembly and disassembly, rather than <b>microtubule</b> bundling leading to apoptosis, or the blocking of bcl-2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microtubules</b> that {{attach to}} the {{kinetochore}}s are known as kinetochore <b>microtubules.</b> Other <b>microtubules</b> will interact with <b>microtubules</b> from the opposite centrosome: these are called nonkinetochore <b>microtubules</b> or polar <b>microtubules.</b> A third type of <b>microtubules,</b> the aster <b>microtubules,</b> radiates from the centrosome into the cytoplasm or contacts components of the membrane skeleton.|$|R

40|$|<b>Microtubules</b> are an {{essential}} part of the cytoskeleton and assist in multiple cellular processes like intracellular transport and cell division. Acetylation in <b>microtubules</b> is a prominent post-translational modification in neurons and it is also a well-known marker of stable <b>microtubules.</b> However, it is not known why stable <b>microtubules</b> are more acetylated than dynamic <b>microtubules.</b> There are two models to explain this phenomenon. The first is that stable <b>microtubules</b> are preferably acetylated and the second is that both are acetylated equally, but dynamic <b>microtubules</b> are destabilized by acetylation. Previous research has shown that dynamic <b>microtubules</b> may in fact be preferentially acetylated, supporting the second model. We have found that at physiological salt concentrations, short dynamic <b>microtubules</b> are more acetylated but no correlation was found between length and extent of acetylation in stable <b>microtubules.</b> We are currently studying how acetylation varies in stable and dynamic <b>microtubules</b> by measuring the rate of change of lengths of acetylated <b>microtubules.</b> This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Microtubule</b> {{polymers}} {{are extremely}} sensitive to various environmental effects. Very {{low levels of}} free calcium can destabilize microtubules and this prevented early researchers from studying the polymer in vitro. Cold temperatures also cause rapid depolymerization of microtubules. In contrast, heavy water promotes <b>microtubule</b> polymer stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} {{paclitaxel}} to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of <b>microtubule</b> dynamics, but {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress <b>microtubule</b> detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during mitosis. Paclitaxel binds to beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{species of}} Prosthecobacter also contain <b>microtubules.</b> The {{structure}} of these bacterial <b>microtubules</b> {{is similar to}} that of eukaryotic <b>microtubules,</b> consisting of a hollow tube of protofilaments assembled from heterodimers of bacterial tubulin A (BtubA) and bacterial tubulin B (BtubB). [...] Both BtubA and BtubB share features of both α- and β-tubulin. Unlike eukaryotic <b>microtubules,</b> bacterial <b>microtubules</b> do not require chaperones to fold. In contrast to the 13 protofilaments of eukaryotic <b>microtubules,</b> bacterial <b>microtubules</b> comprise only five.|$|R
40|$|By use of {{dark-field}} light microscopy, secretory granules {{isolated from}} the anglerfish endocrine pancreas were observed to attach to and release from <b>microtubules</b> assembled in vitro from brain homogenates.

30|$|When we {{compared}} length distributions of ordered versus non-ordered <b>microtubules</b> (Figure  4 A(a), B(a), C(a) and Figure  5 A), we obtained interesting results. The length distribution of ordered <b>microtubules</b> was always significantly narrower {{than that of}} non-ordered <b>microtubules.</b> In case of an MTP concentration of 5.0 mg/ml, the length distribution of ordered <b>microtubules</b> was approximately 3 -fold narrower than that of non-ordered <b>microtubules.</b> In case of an MTP concentration of 2.0 mg/ml, the length distribution of ordered <b>microtubules</b> is approximately 2.5 times narrower than that of non-ordered <b>microtubules.</b> When the temperature was decreased to 26 °C and at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml MTP, the length distribution of ordered <b>microtubules</b> was approximately 9 -fold narrower than that of non-ordered <b>microtubules.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis is {{facilitated}} by three main subgroups of microtubules, known as astral, polar, and kinetochore microtubules. An astral <b>microtubule</b> is a <b>microtubule</b> originating from the MTOC {{that does not}} connect to a chromosome. Astral microtubules instead interact with the cytoskeleton near the cell membrane and function in concert with specialized dynein motors. Dynein motors pull the MTOC toward the cell membrane, thus assisting in correct positioning and orientation of the entire apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Anti-microtubule {{agents are}} plant-derived {{chemicals}} that block cell division by preventing <b>microtubule</b> function. Microtubules {{are an important}} cellular structure composed of two proteins; α-tubulin and β-tubulin. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions. Microtubules are dynamic structures, {{which means that they}} are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. Vinca alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause <b>microtubule</b> dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the <b>microtubule</b> disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.|$|E

40|$|Brain tubulin {{polymerized}} with dynein {{isolated from}} bull spermatozoa forms cold-stable <b>microtubules,</b> {{in contrast with}} <b>microtubules</b> made of brain tubulin polymerized by brain microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).

30|$|Since {{the curved}} <b>microtubules</b> were {{minority}} in our experiments {{their effects on}} the direction of self-organization process could be negligible. However, we estimated the average curvature by applying circle approximation. Therefore we have calculated the curvature as inverse of relevant circle radius. The obtained average curvature of the curved <b>microtubules,</b> which are a minority in the straight <b>microtubules</b> dominated fiber (Figure  1 A), is 0.001 [*]±[*] 0.00039 nm− 1, while the obtained value of curvature for the curved <b>microtubules</b> outside the fiber is 0.006 [*]±[*] 0.0008 nm− 1. Therefore, in the straight <b>microtubules</b> dominated fiber, the average curvature of the curved <b>microtubules</b> (minority) is smaller by factor 6 {{than that of the}} non-ordered <b>microtubules,</b> and by factor 1.5 than the curvature of the curved <b>microtubules</b> of curved <b>microtubules</b> dominated fiber, as shown in Figure  2 A.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the concentration of <b>microtubules</b> and depletion force in the emergence of collective motion of <b>microtubules</b> driven by kinesins. Critical concentrations were found for both <b>microtubules</b> and the depletant to demonstrate the collective motion of <b>microtubules.</b> More importantly, the kinetics of the collective motion were found to be significantly dependent on the concentration of <b>microtubules</b> and the depletant. Substantial variations in the time course of emergence of the collective motion of <b>microtubules</b> were observed in response to the changes in concentration of the <b>microtubules</b> and the depletant.
