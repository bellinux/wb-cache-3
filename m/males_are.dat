5|$|Adult <b>males</b> <b>are</b> less {{ready to}} pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult <b>males</b> <b>are</b> more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because <b>males</b> <b>are</b> smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger <b>males</b> <b>are</b> busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> again polymorphic with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{total length}} for <b>males</b> <b>is</b> 671 mm; for females, 650 mm. Maximum tail length for <b>males</b> <b>is</b> 125 mm; for females, 115 mm.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the predation sex rate, the consumption rate of ten <b>males</b> <b>was</b> estimated {{under the same}} conditions, and to calculate the female daily consumption rate, the daily predation rate of <b>males</b> <b>was</b> subtracted from the average predation rate of the pairs. During {{the first week of}} the experiment, each dead <b>male</b> <b>was</b> replaced by an alive individual (Farhadi et al. 2011).|$|R
50|$|Characteristics of {{offenders}} {{vary from}} the average for specific types of crimes and specific crimes. In terms of violent crime by gender, in 2011, 80.4% of arrested persons <b>were</b> <b>male</b> and 19.6% <b>were</b> female. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> 88.2% of those arrested for homicide, while females were 11.8%. Among those arrested for rape in 2011, <b>males</b> <b>were</b> 98.8% and females were 1.2%. For property crime in 2011, 62.9% of arrested persons <b>were</b> <b>male</b> and 37.1% <b>were</b> female.|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that <b>males</b> <b>are</b> a little larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both {{males and females}} prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these <b>males</b> <b>are</b> preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|The fairy-bluebirds are bulbul-like {{birds of}} open forest or thorn scrub. The <b>males</b> <b>are</b> dark-blue and the females a duller green.|$|E
5|$|The leafbirds are small, bulbul-like birds. The <b>males</b> <b>are</b> brightly plumaged, {{usually in}} greens and yellows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Male</b> {{homosexuality}} <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} the Cook Islands. Consensual <b>male</b> sodomy <b>is</b> punishable {{by up to}} seven years' imprisonment, while indecency between <b>males</b> <b>is</b> punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|According to Census 2001, Desuri has a {{population}} of 5,787, where <b>male</b> <b>are</b> 3,050 and female are 2,737. While Rohat tehsil population <b>is</b> 102,599, where <b>male</b> <b>are</b> 52,215 and female are 50,384.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, adult black non-Hispanic <b>males</b> <b>were</b> incarcerated at {{the rate}} of 4,347 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents. Adult white <b>males</b> <b>were</b> incarcerated {{at the rate}} of 678 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents. Adult Hispanic <b>males</b> <b>were</b> incarcerated {{at the rate of}} 1,755 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents. (For female rates see the table below.) Asian Americans have lower incarceration rates than any other racial group, {{including}} whites.|$|R
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on <b>males</b> <b>are</b> the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E
5|$|According to arachnologist B. J. Kaston, adult {{females are}} 3.5 to 4.5mm in body length, while <b>males</b> <b>are</b> 3 to 3.5mm. The Peckhams' earlier description, however, gives {{a length of}} 3mm for females and 3 to 4.5mm for males.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans <b>males</b> <b>are</b> also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
50|$|In Russia sexual {{activity}} between <b>males</b> <b>was</b> criminalized {{by state law}} on March 4, 1934. Sexual activity between females was {{not mentioned in the}} law. On May 27, 1993, homosexual acts between consenting <b>males</b> <b>were</b> decriminalized.|$|R
50|$|<b>Male</b> <b>is</b> a live album by Foetus in Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe. It {{records the}} Foetus live {{performance}} of November 3, 1990 in Manhattan's famed CBGB nightclub. A film of this performance, also titled <b>Male,</b> <b>was</b> also released.|$|R
60|$|So that {{in these}} eight lots of cocoons and eggs, <b>males</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} in excess. Taken together the proportion of <b>males</b> <b>is</b> as 122.7 to 100 females. But the numbers are hardly {{large enough to be}} trustworthy.|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} requiem sharks, the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> thought to reproduce every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; <b>males</b> <b>are</b> sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
40|$|A <b>male</b> Leptodactylus latrans <b>was</b> {{observed}} calling {{within a}} foam nest located at about 40 cm {{from the edge}} of the pond. The <b>male</b> <b>was</b> collected (voucher deposited at the Herpetological Collection of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Montevideo, Uruguay, MNHN 9476). Ten minutes after the calling <b>male</b> <b>was</b> removed, we observed an amplectic L. latrans pair laying eggs in the same nest. In addition, a third <b>male</b> <b>was</b> at the edge of the foam nest and sporadically swam under the amplectic pair...|$|R
50|$|Previously {{known only}} from a pair taken alive to Europe by Jean Théodore Delacour in 1923, this species was rediscovered in 1990, when an {{immature}} <b>male</b> <b>was</b> trapped by a rattan collector. Another immature <b>male</b> <b>was</b> caught in February 2000.|$|R
50|$|<b>Males</b> <b>were</b> 50.3% females 49.7%.|$|R
5|$|Grown <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} enter {{surprisingly}} shallow bays to rest (whales {{will be in}} state of rest during these occasions). There are unique, coastal groups reported from various areas among the globe such as Scotland, Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikoura, in Davao Gulf. Such coastal groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{required to}} be circumcised shortly after birth, during childhood or around puberty {{as part of a}} rite of passage. Circumcision is commonly practiced in the Jewish and Islamic faiths.|$|E
5|$|It {{is among}} the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans. At birth both sexes are about the same size, but mature <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} 30% to 50% longer and three times as massive as females.|$|E
50|$|The <b>male</b> <b>is</b> 40-42 cm in height, {{with the}} female being {{slightly}} smaller at 35-37 cm. Both sexes are short-tailed and carry an erectile head crest; that of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> slightly longer at 20-30 cm. The <b>male</b> <b>is</b> distinguished by a large throat wattle of feathers, while females and juveniles have no or a much smaller wattle. The length of the wattle can be controlled, and it is always retracted in flight. The male generally has black colored shafts in its feathers.|$|R
50|$|The sexes appear fairly similar, but {{the adult}} <b>male</b> can <b>be</b> {{distinguished}} from the female by its slimmer body and narrower wings. The breast band of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> also weaker {{than that of the}} female, or is non-existent, and the underwing coverts of the <b>male</b> <b>are</b> more uniformly pale. It is straightforward to determine the sex in a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Male</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} woredas in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia. It {{is named}} after the Maale people who are living at this woreda. Part of the Debub Omo Zone, <b>Male</b> <b>is</b> bordered on the south by Bena Tsemay, on the west by Bako Gazer, on the north by the Basketo special woreda and Gelila, on {{the north and east}} by the Gamo Gofa Zone, and on the {{southeast}} by Dirashe special woreda. <b>Male</b> <b>was</b> separated from Bako Gazer woreda.|$|R
5|$|<b>Males</b> <b>are</b> easy to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) <b>males</b> <b>are</b> known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} <b>males,</b> <b>are</b> territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters are polygynous. Females {{usually do}} not {{reproduce}} until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> sexually mature at two years of age. The number of corpora lutea increases directly with age.|$|E
25|$|The upperside of <b>male</b> <b>is</b> velvety black.|$|R
30|$|The {{genitalia}} {{of experimental}} <b>males</b> <b>were</b> lifted {{out of the}} genital cavity, each {{or both of the}} lateral processes were severed at the basal position and the operated genitalia were retracted to the genital chamber using fine forceps under a binocular stereoscope (10 – 15 ×; 216031, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). As this procedure only took approximately 30  s, <b>males</b> <b>were</b> not anaesthetised. The lateral processes are sclerotised and can be cut without effusion of haemolymph. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> marked with individual numbers on their wings using paint markers and then released near their capture site. In the manipulated control <b>males,</b> the genitalia <b>were</b> treated as in experimental males, but each lateral process was tapped ten times with fine forceps under the binocular stereoscope. Females were mated by hand with one of an experimental, manipulated control, and unmanipulated control (wild) male. Paired <b>males</b> and females <b>were</b> all captured and transported to the laboratory for dissection. Any <b>male</b> <b>was</b> never used more than once.|$|R
50|$|The abdomen of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> bright red.|$|R
