5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|A stored value adult EZ-Link or NETS FlashPay branded CEPAS card may be {{purchased}} at any TransitLink Ticket Office or Passenger Service Centre. The CEPAS card {{may be used for}} the payment of MRT, LRT and bus fares. The CEPAS card may also be used for payment for goods and services at selected merchants, Electronic Road Pricing tolls, and Electronic Parking System carparks. Additional credit may {{be purchased}} via cash or NETS at any General Ticketing Machine (GTM), Add Value Machine, TransitLink Ticket Office, Passenger Service Centre, AXS Station, DBS/POSB/OCBC/UOB Automatic Teller Machines, online via a card reader purchased separately, or selected merchants. Additional credit of a predetermined value may also be automatically credited into the card when the card value runs low via an automatic recharge service provided by Interbank GIRO or credit card. An Adult Monthly Travel Card for unlimited travel on MRT, LRT and buses <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> and is non-transferable.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied {{on top of the}} fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{relatively}} short shelf-life, store keepers {{need to be careful}} to replace older fruit regularly to ensure high quality. In some countries, they <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> at roadside stalls, often at a lower price.|$|R

25|$|Insurance <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> {{through an}} agent. A tied agent, working {{exclusively}} with one insurer, represents {{the insurance company}} from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just {{as there is a}} potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.|$|E

ADOF materials state that: [...] "To obtain our materials without charge the Chaplain must describe in his/her order how our materials will be used in an evangelism process to share the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Chaplains will be required to pay for Prayer Coins used for other than ministry purposes, such as awards, recognitions, remembrances, etc." [...] Additionally, ADOF notes that [...] "Prayer Tracts and Prayer Reminder Coins are provided without charge to Chaplains for evangelistic Christian Ministry to troops, sailors, airmen and marines.

2500|$|The Canberra was the {{backbone}} of the Indian Air Force (IAF) for bombing raids and photo-reconnaissance for many decades. Negotiations to acquire the Canberra as a replacement for the [...] obsolete Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers then being used by India began in 1954. During the extended negotiations between Britain and India, the Soviet Union is alleged to have offered their own jet bomber, the Ilyushin Il-28, at a significantly lower price than that asked for the Canberra; by April 1956, however, the Indian government was in favour of the purchase. In January 1957 India placed a large order for the Canberra; a total of 54 B(I)58 bombers, eight PR57 photo-reconnaissance aircraft, and six T4 training aircraft were ordered, deliveries began in the summer of that same year. A total of 12 more Canberras were ordered in September 1957, as many as 30 more <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>purchased</b> by 1962.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Purchasing</b> Manager <b>is</b> an {{employee}} within a company, business or other organization {{who is responsible}} at some level for buying or approving the acquisition {{of goods and services}} needed by the company. Responsible for buying the best quality products, goods and services for their company at the most competitive prices, purchasing managers work {{in a wide range of}} sectors for many different organizations. The position responsibilities may be the same as that of a buyer or purchasing agent, or may include wider supervisory or managerial responsibilities. A Purchasing Manager may oversee the acquisition of materials needed for production, general supplies for offices and facilities, equipment, or construction contracts. A Purchasing Manager often supervises purchasing agents and buyers, but in small companies the <b>Purchasing</b> Manager <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> the <b>purchasing</b> agent or buyer. The Purchasing Manager position <b>may</b> <b>also</b> carry the title [...] "Procurement Manager" [...] or in the public sector, [...] "Procurement Officer".

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} has been including {{one or two}} new songs with a package of hits. This trend started in the early 1980s, and made it necessary for collectors to purchase the [...] "greatest hits" [...] album if they wished to have the complete catalog of an artist's songs, even if those collectors owned all the albums containing the pre-existing hits. By contract, another solution to acquire only the songs, via an online music store, <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> restricted to <b>purchase</b> of the album only, even online. For example, in 2002, The Paperboys released Tenure, which out of its eighteen tracks, contains six new songs.|$|R

Conversely, if a player so chooses, he can select a number of Disadvantages for his character, which give extra Character Points to spend in other areas, but imposes some penalty on the character during play (such as [...] "Small", which decreases the damage the character can inflict with certain weapons, or [...] "Bad Reputation", which causes a great number of NPCs to dislike the character).|$|R

40|$|Background. Moving funds {{electronically}} is both {{efficient and}} effective. Federal {{and state agencies}} are mandating the use of electronic payment for some tax receipts and payments to other governmental units. Many vendors also require or {{encourage the use of}} electronic payments. Increasingly, governments are now using the electronic movement of funds and information to take advantage of its efficiencies and to meet the growing demands of citizens and taxpayers for more ease and accessibility in government services. Electronic disbursement methods include: 1. Fedwire – This method provides same day processing with guaranteed settlement. The cost per transaction is high and it is generally used for large dollar transactions. 2. ACH (Automated Clearing House) – This method is a batch process with one or two day settlement. The cost per transaction is low. It is designed for high-volume, low-value transactions. 3. EBT (Electronic Benefits Transfer) – This is an electronic system that allows recipient transfer of government benefits to a point of sale terminal or ATM.

5000|$|This is a Facebook game {{developed}} for EA Sports by Playfish. The game operates {{on a similar}} premise to the [...] "Ultimate Team" [...] mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player's skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a [...] "training" [...] rating, and {{the combination of the}} two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the [...] "Superstars" [...] league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game [...] "coins", which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing {{the best players in the}} game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to <b>purchase</b> training and stadium upgrades, such as training cones and seating. The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy services and lots of user complaints on the forum.|$|R
