5|$|After the men {{hauled the}} Flyer back from its fourth flight, a {{powerful}} {{gust of wind}} flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the airplane never flew again. The brothers shipped it home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to a British <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> Smithsonian dispute below), before it was finally installed in 1948 in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., its current residence.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|Lobanov-Rostovsky {{ultimately}} sold Szczerbiec to Prince Anatole Demidov {{who kept}} it {{together with the}} rest of the Demidov collection in his Villa San Donato near Florence. In 1870, the sword was bought for 20,000 French francs by Alexander Basilevsky, Russian ambassador to France and great art collector. In 1878, he displayed Szczerbiec at the World's Fair in Paris. By that time, the scabbard had been lost and the sword itself was presented as of Teutonic origin. It was seen by several Polish visitors who speculated whether it could be the Polish coronation sword. In 1884, the entire Basilevsky collection was purchased by Emperor Alexander III of Russia for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Both Polish and other experts at the time expressed doubts as to the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in Russia's largest <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> Historical replicas below). An international museum congress held in Saint Petersburg in 1913 pronounced the sword a 17th-century replica.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, 1967, American Art–20th Century: Image to Abstraction {{brought more}} than one hundred paintings by America’s leading early modernists to Fort Worth from New York. Blips and Ifs (1963–64), the final painting by Stuart Davis (1892–1964), was acquired for the museum from this exhibition, signaling a fundamental redefinition of the museum’s collecting scope. Mitchell Wilder’s embrace of the museum’s collecting mandate led to two building expansions during his tenure, including a major addition in 1977 that doubled the size of the <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> building history below).|$|E
25|$|These are 17 six-foot, painted, plaster-cast maquettes for {{the sixteen}} bronze barons and two bishops which today {{stand in the}} Lords Chamber at Westminster Palace; cast in 1847−1851. These were made by various named sculptors, and {{represent}} the men who signed Magna Carta: each of the fifteen barons and two bishops is named at the base. In 1908 three of the maquettes were displayed in the <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> photo below), and two remain on show. The rest were put in storage and forgotten in the ground floor room of the north tower in 1987, along with several other museum exhibits, before being {{brought to the attention}} of museum staff in May 2008 after the building was flooded. The City of Canterbury museums department was said to have been attempting to remove them to safety for restoration, but was inhibited by logistics and funding. As of May 2011, ten of the maquettes in the basement have been photographed; the fate of the remaining five is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page. Produced by chromolithography, each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed brown leather made to imitate carved wood. A little earlier {{there had been a}} compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the [...] "ivy-mantled tower" [...] in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator leans on a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British <b>Museum</b> (<b>see</b> below).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{annual event}} of note in Gallatin is the yearly Candlelight Cemetery Tour, held {{annually}} {{on the first}} Saturday in October. [...] Held in the town's old cemetery (located close to the town square), actors and actresses depict various historical figures who lived in and around Gallatin during its 200 years of history—particularly those who lived prior to 1900—from lawyers and doctors to business people to various persons of note in the community. [...] Information on these individuals is gathered from various historical documents (legal papers, family journals, etc.). The event {{is sponsored by the}} local Sumner County Historical Society in association with the local county <b>museum</b> (<b>see</b> below), and proceeds from the annual event go towards supporting the local museum.|$|E
2500|$|After the accident, the Coast Guard {{repaired}} {{the fire}} damage, {{decided that the}} place was too remote and dangerous, and automated the station in 1962. The 1,400,000 candlepower light was replaced with a 3,000 candlepower light. The Coast Guard carefully disassembled the 2nd order, 12 bulls-eyed Fresnel lens, hauled it down 141 tower stairs, packed it in six wooden crates, and then lowered the crates by block and tackle [...] down to the crib for shipment. After a protracted search, the Fresnel lens was found 37 years later at the Coast Guard Academy's storage warehouse in New London, Connecticut. [...] The base unit for the lens was relocated from the tower to the museum in 2000. The lens is now {{on display at the}} Marquette Maritime <b>Museum.</b> <b>See,</b> Marquette Harbor Light.|$|E
2500|$|Ducati had an {{important}} place in early Superbike racing history in the United States and vice versa: In 1977, Cycle magazine editors Cook Neilson and Phil Schilling took a Ducati 750SS to first place at Daytona in the second-ever season of AMA Superbike racing. [...] "Neilson retired from racing {{at the end of}} the year, but the bike he and Schilling built — nicknamed Old Blue for its blue livery — became a legend," [...] says Richard Backus from Motorcycle Classics: [...] "How big a legend? Big enough for Ducati to team with Italian specialty builder NCR to craft a limited-edition update, New Blue, based on the 2007 Sport 1000S, and big enough to inspire the crew at the Barber Vintage Motorsports <b>Museum</b> (<b>see</b> Barber Motorsports Park), arguably one of the most important motorcycle museums in the world, to commission Ducati specialist Rich Lambrechts to craft a bolt-by-bolt replica for its collection. The finished bike's name? Deja Blue." ...|$|E
