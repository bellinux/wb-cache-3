40|$|The Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) {{has imposed}} itself ambitious {{objectives}} concerning industrial leadership, {{safety and security}} as well as emissions reduction within civil aviation toward the years 2020 and 2050, respectively. Integration of electrochemical energy conversion technologies in form of secondary batteries, fuel cells or supercapacitors shows significant potential to reduce emissions of both contaminants and noise aboard future generations of aircraft. With its group Energy System Integration (ESI) the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics (TT) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) performs applied research and development with respect to innovative electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies; thereby, research focusses on emergency and auxiliary power for more-electric civil aircraft as well as propulsion power for small all-electric aircraft. A promising approach is the <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> integration of lowtemperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (LT-PEMFC) exploiting not only their electric output power but also their waste heat, process water and oxygen-depleted air (ODA) for an effective and efficient integration into aircraft system architectures. The present talk summarizes the most recent research and development results concerning multifunctional fuel cell systems (MFFCS) for emergency and/or auxiliary power generation aboard future generations of civil aircraft, with special emphasis on conceptual designs and operation strategies. Based on measurement data and theoretical studies revealing the multipurpose power demand of existing civil short- & mid-range aircraft, general requirements are derived to dimension MFFCS. It is shown that with existing fuel cell technology it is feasible to fulfill these requirements; however, novel conceptual designs for both electric and process engineering interconnection of MFFCS demonstrate the potential to optimize the dynamical behavior and/or the degradation process of the fuel cell stacks. This potential is utilized to develop optimum power point tracking method for arrays possessing several fuel cell stacks in <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> integration and deduce operation strategies for MFFCS.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> under high- to hyper-velocity impact loading. This <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> is a plate structure that, in addition to its load bearing function, has the ability of self-repairing holes generated by impacts. In order to achieve multiple functionality the panel consists of several different layers, each having a specific task, and thus primary contributing to a specific function of the entire multifunctional structure system. From a structural point of view this <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> can be considered as a multilayer plate. From a functional perspective the panel layers can be divided in two groups: structural layer and self-healing layer. Each layer can occur once or more in a panel configuration. The performance of the multifunctional structure depends on the number of layers, the mechanical and physical properties of the individual layers, layer thickness and on the arrangement of the various layers in a multifunctional structure. The <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system</b> investigated in this work consists of one self-healing layer and one or two structural layers. To provide the structural system with the ability to seal holes generated by perforating impacts a layer of ethylene-co-methacrylic acid ionomer was used in a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>system.</b> These ionomers have been observed to self-heal following ballistic puncture and such a response is an inherent behaviour of those materials, therefore no external intervention is necessary in the self-healing process. For the structural layers, plates made of composite materials were used. Two slightly different structural layers were investigated. One is a laminate made entirely of carbon fibre reinforced plastics, while the other is a carbon fibre laminate with aramid fabric/epoxy resin composite layers attached to its front and back face. These two structural layers and the ionomer layer were combined to form several configurations of multifunctional panels. The different configurations, including also the individual layers alone, were tested under impact loading. Tests on the ionomer alone were performed to study its protection capability for bumper applications. For this purpose tests on aluminium plates were also performed and the results were compared to those of the ionomer. The protection capability was evaluated by studying the damage on witness plates and the momentum transferred to them. The composite structural layers for the multifunctional structure were tested individually and their behaviour was compared with that of the ionomer self-healing layer. Multifunctional panel configurations consisting of two and three layers were also tested. The impact behaviour and the comparison of the various configurations were characterized through the momentum transfer to the witness plate, the fragments velocities in the debris cloud, the damage in the layers, in certain cases the damage on the witness plate was also used. Several instruments were used to measure the relevant quantities. A ballistic pendulum was used to estimate the momentum of the debris cloud. A high-speed video camera was employed to film the impact tests, which enabled the measurement of fragments velocities by a dedicated software. An ultrasound flaw detector was applied for delamination damage detection in the composite material. Superficial damage was inspected visually. Learning how to use the ultrasound flaw detector and the high-speed video camera was an integral part of the PhD work that required a considerable amount of time. The self-healing of the ionomer was checked for all tests by visually examining the ionomer samples. The experiments were conducted at the CISAS impact facility, using a two stage light gas gun. The impact velocities in the experimental tests ranged from 1. 0 to 4. 0 km/s. Aluminium spherical projectiles were used, and ranged in diameter from 1. 5 to 5. 6 mm. Numerical simulations of the experimental tests on the individual layers were performed and the results were compared. The numerical simulations were performed with the commercially available ‘hydrocode’ Ansys Autodyn. ...|$|E

Effectiveness of these policy instruments {{have to deal with}} ecological, economic and social complexities and with complexities in individual decisions of local actors leading to system shifts. Objective: The objective {{of this paper is to}} discover the most important social and/or economic drivers that cause farm systems to shift between a monofunctional (providing food) and a multifunctional state (providing food and natural pest regulation). Methods: Using a cellular automata model, we simulated decisions of individual farmers to shift between a mono-and multifunctional state through time, based on their behaviour type and on financial and social consequences. Collaboration of multifunctional farmers at a landscape scale is a precondition to provide a reliable level of natural pest regulation. Results: Costs of applying green infrastructure was an important driver for the size and the conversion rate of shifts between mono-and <b>multifunctional</b> farming <b>systems.</b> Shifts towards <b>multifunctional</b> farming were enhanced by a higher motivation of farmers to produce sustainably, while shifts (back) to a monofunctional state was enhanced by a low social cohesion between multifunctional farmers. Conclusions: These results suggest that in order to develop a <b>multifunctional</b> farming <b>system,</b> individual farmers should act counterintuitively to their conventional farming environment.
