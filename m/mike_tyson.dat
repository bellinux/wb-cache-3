5000|$|Don Kaye of Kerrang! {{praised the}} bands [...] "confidence and identity", unusual in debut albums. However, the album still {{received}} mixed reviews overall.

Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating, saying [...] "Stone Temple Pilots hit Sex Type Thing could be <b>Mike</b> <b>Tysons</b> rape defense transcribed into grunge rock. Its unclear whether STP, which {{sounds like it}} has crash-landed Pearl Jam into Alice in Chains, is condemning or identifying with its narrator. With a real point of view, this band could be bigger than an accident." [...] Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, felt that the band is hard to distinguish from various other hard rock acts and said that, despite their best power chords, [...] "Sex Type Thing" [...] shows that they should [...] "reconceive their aesthetic strategy—critiquewise, irony has no teeth when the will to sexual power still powers your power chords." ...|$|R

The next night on Raw, The Legacy participated in a six-man tag team match against Kingston, Yoshi Tatsu, and Evan Bourne, designed to show their unity, but Orton attacked Rhodes and DiBiase and the following week on Raw, Rhodes and DiBiase attacked Orton in retaliation, although Orton was able to fight them off. Orton's split from the group was cemented when he lost a handicap match against both Rhodes and DiBiase on Raw and showed increasing signs of becoming a fan favorite. This led to a Triple Threat Match between all three members at WrestleMania XXVI, where Rhodes and DiBiase proclaimed neither minded not winning so long as Orton was pinned, but in the match Orton pinned DiBiase. DiBiase and Rhodes attacked each other during the match, ending the duo, and Rhodes was punted by Orton and taken out of action for approximately a month.

5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev.

The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E
