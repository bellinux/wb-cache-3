Baltica, Vol. 22 (2), 89 – 98. Vilnius. ISSN 0067 – 3064. Abstract Increasing demand for alternative energy sources leads to an interest in unconventional hydrocarbons, e. g. natural shale gas. Based on initial evaluation, the Early Silurian graptolite shales are studied as prospective shale gas sources in the Baltic region. This paper addresses the occurrence, generation potential and the volume of unconventional gas in place. New organic geochemistry data and vitrinite like macerals reflectance meas-urements, incorporated with well logs and core data were used to reveal the potential for shale gas. The Early Silurian shales are organically rich, type II, oil–prone marine sediments. The organic matter content ranges from 0. 7 up to 19. 2 %. Hydrocarbon generation potential ranges from 7 up to 113 kg HC/t rock, and the Hydrogen Index ranges from 136 up to 571 mg HC/g TOC. Maturity of the organic matter increases southwestwards from 0. 6 up to 1. 94 % (R o). The Early Silurian shales in Western Lithuania generated large amounts of hydrocarbons with an estimated volume of expelled hydrocarbons of about 13. 75 × 106 kg. This <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is equivalent to 389 × 105 cubic meters of methane for a section of 1 km 2 and 150 m thickness...|$|E

From the nitrogen adsorption isotherm data and surface morphology of spherical catalysts it was seen that spherical catalysts Fe 2 O 3 /SiO 2 and NiO/SiO 2 have a nearly ideal spherical shape and may be referred to mesoporous materials, while {{the bulk of the}} mesopores in pores is of a diameter of 18 – 27  nm (Fe 2 O 3 /SiO 2) and 18 – 19  nm (NiO/SiO 2). The feasibility of using the spherical catalysts NiO/SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 /SiO 2 in the process of hydrogenation of polycyclic hydrocarbons model is connected with the chemical activity, which is proportional to the specific surface area and high-dispersing, and the porous structure of these catalytic systems. It should be noted that along with nanocatalysts β-FeOOH, Fe(OA) 3, Fe 3 O 4, the spherical catalysts NiO/SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 /SiO 2 contribute to the selective hydrogenation of anthracene to 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroanthracene and are more active compared with a commercial cobalt-molybdenum catalyst seen from the hydrogenation product yield and destruction during the anthracene hydrogenation. From the experimental data, it can be concluded that nanosized and spherical catalysts are newly developed catalyst systems; they can contribute to a deeper chemical modification of the organic <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> leading to significantly higher yield of light products.|$|E

40|$|Mineral oil is a quite {{widespread}} contaminant of foods. It {{derives from}} different sources, but more recently {{attention has been}} focused mainly on paperboard packaging. Such a contamination derives from the offset printing inks applied directly to the packaging, and/or from the ink present in the recycled fibers used (generally deriving from newspapers). Mineral oil contains proportions of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH, including n-alkanes, isoalkanes and cycloalkanes), and mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH), which both are characterized by humps of unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) after gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. Resolution can be greatly improved using a comprehensive multidimensional GC (GC×GC) approach, which allows to define a more detailed profile of the compound distribution in the unresolved hump, especially for the MOAH fraction, where compounds can be separated according {{to the number of}} rings. Despite the lack of structural information (obtainable using a mass spectrometer – MS - detector), the flame ionization detector (FID) is the detector of choice to reliably quantify such humps, because FIDs provide virtually the same response per unit of <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> on the contrary of the MS detector. Moreover the lack of a proper calibration standard is a serious quantification problem in MS analysis. The aim of the present work is to develop a method to simultaneously quantify and confirm mineral oil contamination, by using GC×GC with dual detection: FID for quantification purposes, and MS for confirmation. The MOSH and MOAH fraction were separated by using an SPE cartridge, manually packed with silvered silica gel (Ag-SPE), before injection in the GC×GC system. The presence of interfering compounds, in the fraction of interest, can be determined both by the position in the bidimensional plot and the mass spectrum profile acquired simultaneously. The quantitative results (both for the MOSH and the MOAH fractions) obtained were compared with those derived by performing large volume injection (LVI) GC–FID, after the same Ag-SPE fractionation step, and through a hyphenated liquid-gas chromatographic system (LC–GC) ...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{contribute a}} significant <b>mass</b> fraction <b>of</b> ambient aerosol {{and play a}} role in determining the physiochemical properties of ambient aerosol. A significant fraction of organic aerosol is secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which is produced when the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) originated from various anthropogenic and biogenic sources react with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and nitrate radicals to form lower volatility organic compounds, which subsequently partition into the particle phase. Understanding the composition of ambient aerosol is crucial for identifying their sources and formation mechanisms and predicting their properties and effects on various ambient processes. This thesis focuses on investigating the composition of laboratory–generated SOA formed from the oxidation of biogenic VOCs of atmospheric importance (isoprene and β–caryophyllene) and ambient aerosol collected in the field campaigns using advanced mass spectrometric techniques. By comparing the mass spectrometric data collected for the both laboratory–generated SOA and ambient aerosol, we propose reaction pathways and new chemical tracers for these biogenic VOCs, which enhance our knowledge of the composition, sources, and formation pathways of SOA in the atmosphere.

40|$|Current {{atmospheric}} models do {{not include}} secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from gas-phase reactions <b>of</b> polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs). Recent {{studies have shown that}} primary emissions undergo oxidation in the gas phase, leading to SOA formation. This opens the possibility that low-volatility gas-phase precursors are a potentially large source of SOA. In this work, SOA formation from gas-phase photooxidation of naphthalene, 1 -methylnaphthalene (1 -MN), 2 -methylnaphthalene (2 - MN), and 1, 2 -dimethylnaphthalene (1, 2 -DMN) is studied in the Caltech dual 28 -m^ 3 chambers. Under high-NO_x conditions and aerosol mass loadings between 10 and 40 μgm^(− 3), the SOA yields (<b>mass</b> <b>of</b> SOA per <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> reacted) ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 30 for naphthalene, 0. 19 to 0. 39 for 1 -MN, 0. 26 to 0. 45 for 2 -MN, and constant at 0. 31 for 1, 2 -DMN. Under low-NO_x conditions, the SOA yields were measured to be 0. 73, 0. 68, and 0. 58, for naphthalene, 1 - MN, and 2 -MN, respectively. The SOA was observed to be semivolatile under high-NO_x conditions and essentially nonvolatile under low-NO_x conditions, owing to the higher fraction of ring-retaining products formed under low-NO_x conditions. When applying these measured yields to estimate SOA formation from primary emissions of diesel engines and wood burning, PAHs are estimated to yield 3 – 5 times more SOA than light aromatic compounds over photooxidation timescales of less than 12 h.

By performing photooxidation experiments under varying NOx conditions, {{the effect of}} NOx on SOA formation for these biogenic hydrocarbons is evaluated. The NOx dependence of α-pinene SOA formation follows the same trend as that of isoprene (Kroll et al., 2006), in which SOA yield (defined as the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> organic aerosol formed to the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> parent <b>hydrocarbon</b> reacted) decreases as NOx level increases. The NOx dependence of SOA yield for the sesquiterpenes, longifolene and aromadendrene, however, differs from that determined for isoprene and α-pinene; the aerosol yield under high-NOx conditions substantially exceeds that under low-NOx conditions. The reversal of the NOx dependence of SOA formation for the sesquiterpenes is consistent with formation of relatively nonvolatile organic nitrates, and/or the isomerization of large alkoxy radicals that leads to less volatile products.

This problem has been overcome by reducing the crystal size. This review introduces size-controlled preparation of nano-sized zeolites via hydrothermal synthesis in water/surfactant/organic solvent (emulsion method) and their application to heterogeneous catalysts. The ionicity of the hydrophilic group in surfactant molecules and the concentration of the Si source affected the crystallinity and morphology of zeolites prepared using the emulsion method.

The effect of operating mode on treatment performance was examined at a continuous air flow and consecutively at two different flow rates, and {{compared with an}} intermittent (pulse) flow rate. The two-rate flow was needed due to the inhibitory effect of toluene on indigenous microorganisms at above 75 ␘f the toluene saturation concentrations in the gas phase. About three times less air was required for toluene than for decane to achieve comparable removal efficiency at the constant flow. This air volume could be reduced, {{in the case of}} decane, by a factor of 1. 6 and 2. 9, at the two-rate and intermittent flow, respectively. A higher contribution of biodegradation to the overall removal <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> will lower hydrocarbon concentrations in the off-gases to be treated. The relative concentration of decane did not exceed 60 ␘f the saturation concentration, indicating that the rate of volatilization limited its removal. When non-aqueous phase liquid was present, the air was almost fully saturated with toluene and its transport capacity was almost fully used.

In this study, an integrated field landfarming technique was carried out to assess the relative effectiveness of five biological approaches on diesel degradation. The limiting factors during the degradation process were discussed. Method A total of five treatments were tested, including conventional landfarming, nutrient enhancement (NE), biosurfactant addition (BS), bioaugmentation (BA), and combination of bioaugmentation and biosurfactant addition (BAS). The consortium consisted of four diesel-degrading bacteria strains. Rhamnolipid {{was used as the}} biosurfactant. The diesel concentration, bacterial population, evolution of CO(2), and bacterial community in the soil were periodically measured. Results The best overall degradation efficiency was achieved by BAS treatment (90 +/- 2 %), followed by BA (86 +/- 2 %), NE (84 +/- 3 %), BS (78 +/- 3 %), and conventional landfarming (68 +/- 3 %).

Experiments are performed {{in the dark and}} under dry conditions (RH 2 O 5 as a source of NO 3 radicals. For an initial isoprene concentration of 18. 4 to 101. 6 ppb, the SOA yield (defined as the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> organic aerosol formed to the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> parent <b>hydrocarbon</b> reacted) ranges from 4. 3 % to 23. 8 %. By examining the time evolutions of gas-phase intermediate products and aerosol volume in real time, we are able to constrain the chemistry that leads to the formation of low-volatility products. Although the formation of ROOR from {{the reaction of}} two peroxy radicals (RO 2) has generally been considered as a minor channel, based on the gas-phase and aerosol-phase data it appears that RO 2 +RO 2 reaction (self reaction or cross-reaction) in the gas phase yielding ROOR products is a dominant SOA formation pathway. A wide array of organic nitrates and peroxides are identified in the aerosol formed and mechanisms for SOA formation are proposed. Using a uniform SOA yield of 10 % (corresponding to M o ? 10 ?g m ? 3), it is estimated that ~ 2 to 3 Tg yr ? 1 of SOA results from isoprene + NO 3. The extent to which the results from this study can be applied to conditions in the atmosphere depends on the fate of peroxy radicals (i. e. the relative importance of RO 2 +RO 2 versus RO 2 +NO 3 reactions) in the nighttime troposphere...|$|R

40|$|During the 19502 ̆ 7 s, 602 ̆ 7 s and 702 ̆ 7 s, a {{great number}} of {{military}} and civilian airfields dumped thousands of gallons of fuel, waste oils and solvents into the subsurface environment as part of routine fire training activities. These areas now pose a threat to humans and wildlife. This research investigates bioventing and biosparging as remedial alternatives at Plattsburgh Air Force Base (PAFB) where soils are heavily contaminated with JP- 4 and solvents. ^ To begin the investigation, site geology and contaminant constituents were thoroughly characterized. Installation and sampling of soil gas monitoring points confirmed the presence <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and TCE vapors in the vadose zone as well as a gradient of decreasing oxygen and increasing carbon dioxide from the ground surface to the water table indicative <b>of</b> aerobic <b>hydrocarbon</b> degradation. New models were developed and used to determine soil gas constituent mass fluxes during ambient and bioventing/biosparging conditions. <b>Mass</b> fluxes <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> TCE, oxygen and carbon dioxide were calculated during ambient conditions based on the soil gas profiles. Combining this information with contaminant characterization and extent yielded an estimated cleanup time of approximately 150 years. ^ After the initial characterization, the bioventing system, operating above the water table, was activated followed by sampling and analysis of O 2, CO 2, TCE, and HCs. Following 6 months <b>of</b> operation, compound <b>mass</b> fluxes under the pilot scale bioventing system indicated an increase in the hydrocarbon degradation rate by a factor of 4 for an estimated cleanup time of 37 years. ^ After ending the bioventing phase, the biosparging system, injecting air below the water table, was subsequently activated and the same soil gas constituents measured over a period of 4 months. Compound mass flux results indicated a hydrocarbon degradation rate increase over ambient conditions by a factor of 2 (75 years). A new, near surface soil gas measurement tool was developed allowing sample collection in shallow (1 m) soils with high resolution (2 cm). ^ Based on the pilot scale bioventing and biosparging results, either one or a combination of both of these remedial alternatives would accelerate the cleanup process at PAFB for a reasonable cost. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{experimental results}} on <b>mass</b> transport <b>of</b> small <b>hydrocarbons</b> in micro-porous crystals obtained via interference microscopy (IFM). The transport {{process has been}} investigated in three difffferent materials with difffferent pore structures : the metal-organic framework Zn(tbip) with one-dimensional pores, a FER type zeolite with two-dimensional anisotropic pore structure and zeolite A, a LTA type material with isotropic three-dimensional pore structure. Mass transport is {{described in terms of}} diffffusivity and surface permeability, both derived from the detected transient concentration profiles. The results on intra-crystalline diffffusion are discussed under consideration of the influences of pore diameter and molecule diameter, which are both found to have a strong influence on the diffffusivity. Based on experimental results measured on the Zn(tbip) material, a new model for the description of surface barriers is developed and proved by experiment. It is demonstrated that the observed surface barrier is created by the total blockage {{of a large number of}} pore entrances at the surface and not by a homogeneous surface layer...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Concern {{over the}} {{negative}} impact that automobiles have on air quality has prompted renewed interest in methods for quantifying vehicle tailpipe emissions. In this paper we present non-linear regression models {{that can be used}} to estimate the additional <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> carbon monoxide, <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and nitrogen oxides that would be expected to be produced by vehicles traversing a roadway, if a traffic signal was to be installed. The regression models use traffic demands, roadway characteristics, and traffic signal timing parameters as explanatory variables. Data for calibrating these models are obtained from the application of Integration, a microscopic traffic simulation model, to 8100 individual scenarios. The validity of using Integration as a source for emission data is examined using field data. The proposed models have adjusted R 2 values ranging from 0. 76 to 0. 95. A comparison of the proposed models to similar models contained within the Canadian Capacity Guide indicate marked differences in the relative and absolute impact that traffic signals have on the quantity of pollutants produced. 1...|$|R

40|$|Photodissociation of gaseous bromocyclopropane via its A-band {{continuum}} {{has been}} studied at excitation wavelengths ranging from 230 nm to 267 nm. Velocity-map images of ground-state bromine atoms (Br), spin-orbit excited bromine atoms (Br*) and C 3 H 5 hydrocarbon radicals reveal the kinetic energies of these various photofragments. Both Br and Br* atoms are predominantly generated via repulsive excited electronic states in a prompt photodissociation {{process in which the}} hydrocarbon co-fragment is a cyclopropyl radical. However, the images obtained at the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hydrocarbon</b> radical fragment identify a channel with total kinetic energy greater than that deduced from the Br and Br* images, and with a kinetic energy distribution that exceeds the energetic limit for Br + cyclopropyl radical products. The velocity-map images of these C 3 H 5 fragments have lower angular anisotropies than measured for Br and Br*, indicating molecular restructuring during dissociation. The high kinetic energy C 3 H 5 signals are assigned to allyl radicals generated by a minor photochemical pathway which involves concerted C-Br bond dissociation and cyclopropyl ring-opening following single UV-photon absorption. Slow photofragments also contribute to the velocity map images obtained at the C 3 H 5 radical mass, but corresponding slow Br atoms are not observed. These features in the images are attributed to C 3 H 5 + from the photodissociation of the C 3 H 5 Br+ molecular cation following two-photon ionization of the parent compound. This assignment is confirmed by 118 -nm vacuum ultraviolet ionization studies that prepare the molecular cation in its ground electronic state prior to UV photodissociation...|$|R
