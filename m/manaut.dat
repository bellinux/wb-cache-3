40|$|This paper {{intends to}} analyze the {{historical}} evolution of military involvement in internal security affairs of Mexico since the late 1940 s. Recently, many critics have written extensively about Mexico’s heavily militarized policy towards drug trafficking and the organized crime (f. ex: Moloeznik 2010; <b>Manaut</b> 2009; Artz 2003). But without recognizing the historical continuities underlying such policy model, we cannot fully comprehend its origins and effectiveness. Historical-institutionalism is a useful theoretical approach when {{we are dealing with}} slow-moving process not captured by a short-time perspective. This approach has emphasized how things that have been institutionalized are inert and un-changed (Mahoney and Thelen 2010). They consider institutions to generate different sets of power distribution that can be changed according to the actors’ will. Pierson (Pierson 2000) in the work “Politics in Time” has argued that since what characterizes science is the discovery of causal relations we should consider time itself as an intervenient variable. In fact, causes and consequences may be separated over time and it may be useful to stretch the temporal horizon of a given analysis. (First paragraph...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we review}} and correct the first Born {{differential}} cross section for the process of Mott scattering of a Dirac-Volkov electron, namely, the expression (26) derived by Szymanowski (et al) [Physical Review A 56, 3846 (1997) ]. In particular, we disagree with the dσ expression of dΩ they obtained and we give the exact coefficients multiplying the various Bessel functions appearing in the scattering {{differential cross section}}. Comparison of our numerical calculations with those of Szymanowski et al. shows qualitative and quantitative differences when the incoming total electron energy and the electric field strength are increased particularly {{in the direction of}} the laser propagation. Such corrections are very important since the relativistic electronic dressing of any Dirac-Volkov charged particle gives rise to these coefficients that multiply the various Bessel functions and the relativistic study of other processes (such as excitation, ionisation, etc [...] ) depends strongly of the correctness and reliability of the calculations for this process of Mott Scattering in presence of a laser field. Our work has been accepted [Y. Attaourti, B. <b>Manaut,</b> Physical Review A 68, 067401 (2003) ] but only as a comment. In this paper, we give the full details of the calculations as well as the clear explanation of the large discrepancies that their results could cause when working in the ultra relativistic regime and using a very strong laser field corresponding to an electric field ε = 5. 89 in atomic units.
