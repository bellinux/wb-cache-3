50|$|Patients with {{respiratory}} arrest can be intubated without drugs. However, {{patients can}} be given sedating and paralytic drugs to minimize discomfort and help out with intubation. Pretreatment includes 100% oxygen, lidocaine, and atropine. 100% oxygen should be administered for 3 to 5 minutes. The time depends on pulse rate, pulmonary function, RBC count, and other metabolic factors. Lidocaine {{can be given}} in 1.5 mg/kg IV {{a few minutes before}} sedation and paralysis. The purpose of administering lidocaine is to blunt the sympathetic response of an increased heart rate, blood pressure, and intracranial pressure caused by laryngoscopy. Atropine can be given when children produce a vagal response, evidenced by bradycardia, in response to intubation. Some physicians even give out vecuronium, which is a neuromuscular blocker to prevent muscle fasciculations in patients over 4 years old. Fasciculations may result in muscle pain on awakening. Laryngoscopy and intubation are uncomfortable procedures, so etomidate may be delivered. Etomidate is a short-acting IV drug with sedative analgesic properties. The drug works well and does not cause cardiovascular depression. Ketamine is an anesthetic that may be used as well, but it may cause hallucinations or bizarre behavior upon awakening. Thiopental and <b>methohexital</b> may be used as well to provide sedation, but they tend to cause hypotension.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{barbiturates}} mentioned above, thiopental and <b>methohexital,</b> are ultra-short-acting, and {{are used}} to induce and maintain anesthesia. However, though they produce unconsciousness, they provide no analgesia (pain relief) and must be used with other agents. Benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} sedation before or after surgery and can be used to induce and maintain general anesthesia. When benzodiazepines are used to induce general anesthesia, midazolam is preferred. Benzodiazepines are also used for sedation during procedures that do not require general anesthesia. Like barbiturates, benzodiazepines have no pain-relieving properties. Propofol {{is one of the most}} commonly used intravenous drugs employed to induce and maintain general anesthesia. It can also be used for sedation during procedures or in the ICU. Like the other agents mentioned above, it renders patients unconscious without producing pain relief. Because of its favorable physiological effects, [...] "etomidate has been primarily used in sick patients". Ketamine is infrequently used in anesthesia because of the unpleasant experiences that sometimes occur on emergence from anesthesia, which include [...] "vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences, and illusions." [...] However, like etomidate it is frequently used in emergency settings and with sick patients because it produces fewer adverse physiological effects. Unlike the intravenous anesthetic drugs previously mentioned, ketamine produces profound pain relief, even in doses lower than those that induce general anesthesia. Also unlike the other anesthetic agents in this section, patients who receive ketamine alone appear to be in a cataleptic state, unlike other states of anesthesia that resemble normal sleep. Ketamine-anesthetized patients have profound analgesia but keep their eyes open and maintain many reflexes.|$|E

The objective {{of our study}} was to compare the use of <b>methohexital</b> and amobarbital during Wada testing regarding language and memory lateralization quotients as well as speech arrest times. MethodsA chart review of 582 consecutive patients undergoing 1041 Wada-procedures was performed (left= 60, right= 63, bilateral= 459). Language lateralization was calculated based on duration of speech arrest using a laterality index, defined as (L−R) /(L+R). Memory lateralization was expressed as percentage of retained objects and laterality quotient. ResultsLanguage and memory lateralization revealed a similar distribution with amobarbital and <b>methohexital.</b> Speech arrest after left and right-sided injection was significantly longer in the amobarbital group {{as compared to the}} <b>methohexital</b> group.

40|$|<b>Methohexital</b> is an ultrashort-acting {{barbiturate}} {{widely used}} in dentistry because of its rapid onset, predictable effects, and short duration of action. Like other barbiturates, <b>methohexital</b> exerts its effects through the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. By binding to its own receptor on the complex, <b>methohexital</b> augments the inhibitory effect of GABA on neurons and additionally can exert a similar effect independent of GABA. After intravenous injection, maximal brain concentrations are achieved within 30 sec and then quickly fall as the drug is redistributed to other tissues, yielding a duration of action after a single dose of 4 to 7 min. Hepatic metabolism accounts for elimination of the drug. <b>Methohexital</b> at conventional doses in healthy individuals is a mild respiratory depressant with modest cardiovascular effects. Adverse effects, however, can include apnea, cardiovascular depression, laryngospasm, hiccough, and allergic-like reactions. Although more recently introduced drugs, such as midazolam, etomidate, and propofol, have specific advantages, <b>methohexital</b> remains a drug of choice for dental outpatient anesthesia because of its low cost, rapid onset, short duration, lack of secretory or emetic properties, and proven history...|$|E

40|$|Anesthetic {{drugs are}} {{frequently}} mixed or coadministered to optimize anesthetic effects while minimizing adverse effects. <b>Methohexital</b> advantages include its low cost and rapid onset, while propofol provides improved airway anesthesia and extremely rapid clearance from the plasma. Therefore, {{a mixture of}} these agents might well be superior to either drug given alone. We wished {{to determine whether a}} mixture of <b>methohexital</b> and propofol is chemically and physically stable. A 1 : 1 mixture of propofol 10 mg/ml and <b>methohexital</b> was prepared. At times varying from 0 to 48 hours, mixtures with an internal standard of thymol kept at room temperature were thrice extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of diethyl ether:pentane, dried under nitrogen, and treated overnight with bis-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide. The resultant derivatives were transferred to microsample vials and analyzed by GC-MS. Drug stability was quantified by electronic integration of peak areas representing characteristic ions for each drug. For each sample, the peak area of the <b>methohexital</b> ion (m/z 239) or propofol ion (m/z 235) relative to the corresponding thymol ion (m/z 207) served as an index of the concentration of the drug in the sample. At times varying from 0 to 48 hours, mixtures without thymol were used to determine mean droplet size of the particles. This was accomplished using both an Accusizer and a Nicomp 370 Particle Sizer. One way ANOVA tested for significant changes in drug concentrations and mean particle size as a function of time. There was no significant breakdown of propofol or <b>methohexital</b> when combined in a 1 : 1 mixture and allowed to stand for 48 hours, nor was there an increase in particle size suggestive of emulsion instability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are two {{recognized}} {{methods of}} estimating the brain concentrations of IV anesthetic drugs: (i) use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of drug effect, from arterial concentrations and electroencephalogram changes, and (ii) direct {{measurement of the}} uptake of drug in the brain, by simultaneously measuring arterial and jugular concentrations and cerebral blood flow (mass-balance method). These two methods have not been directly compared. Because an accurate estimate of the time taken for transfer of anesthetic drug from arterial blood to its effect-compartment in the brain is critical for accurate effect-compartment dosing in IV anesthesia, we compared the PK/PD and mass-balance methods for propofol, <b>methohexital,</b> and ketamine in a sheep model. METHODS: After instrumentation with arterial and sagittal-sinus cannulae, electrocorticogram, and sagittal sinus Doppler flow measurement seven adult sheep were given a random sequence of short anesthetic infusions with <b>methohexital,</b> ketamine, and propofol. Multiple blood samples were taken for measurement of {{the time course of}} the drug concentrations, and the electrocorticogram processed (approximate entropy, for propofol and <b>methohexital</b> and percentage high frequency time, for ketamine) to numerically quantify drug effect. RESULTS: Using the PK/PD method the t 1 / 2 Keo was 2. 0 ± 0. 4 min for ketamine, 2. 7 ± 1. 1 min for propofol, and was significantly shorter (0. 3 ± 0. 1 min) for <b>methohexital.</b> PK/PD and the mass-balance methods did not differ in the times to peak effect.
