The compositions chosen were albite, jadeite and nepheline on the join NaAlOlSiO 2 and two others of the join at 75 mole percent SiO 2, one peralkaline and one peraluminous. All <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities</b> were independent of shear rate over two orders of magnitude, indicating Newtonian behavior. All viscosity-temperature relationships were Arrhenian within error. Fluorine reduces the viscosities and activation energies of all melts investigated. The viscosity-reducing power of fluorine increases with the SiO 2 content of melts on the join NaAlO 2 -SiO 2 and is a maximum at Na/Al (molar) = I for melts containing 75 mole percent SiO 2. Fluorine and water have similar effects on aluminosilicate <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities,</b> probably due to depolymerization of these melts by replacement of Si-O-(Si, Al) bridges with Si-OH and Si-F bonds, respectively. Evidence from slag systems shows that fluorine also reduces the viscosity of depolymerized silicate melts. The viscous flow of phonolites, trachytes and rhyolites will be strongly afected by fluorine. It appears that fluorine contents of igneous rocks may be combined with water in calculation schemes for determining the <b>viscosity</b> of natural <b>melts.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of a polymer are strongly {{dependent on the}} size or length of the polymer chain. For example, as chain length is increased, melting and boiling temperatures increase quickly. Impact resistance also tends to increase with chain length, as does the viscosity, or resistance to flow, of the polymer in its molten state. <b>Melt</b> <b>viscosity</b> [...] is related to polymer chain length Z roughly as [...] ~ Z3.2, so that a tenfold increase in polymer chain length results in a viscosity increase of over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and toughness, and increase the glass transition temperature (Tg). This {{is a result of}} the increase in chain interactions such as Van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.|$|E

40|$|High-performance {{polymers}} {{that have}} improved processing characteristics, and {{a method of}} making them, have been invented. One of the improved characteristics is low (relative to corresponding prior polymers) <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities</b> at given temperatures. This characteristic {{makes it possible to}} utilize such processes as resin-transfer molding and resin-film infusion and to perform autoclave processing at lower temperatures and/or pressures. Another improved characteristic is larger processing windows that is, longer times at low viscosities. Other improved characteristics include increased solubility of uncured polymer precursors that contain reactive groups, greater densities of cross-links in cured polymers, improved mechanical properties of the cured polymers, and greater resistance of the cured polymers to chemical attack. The invention is particularly applicable to poly(arylene ether) s [PAEs] and polyimides [PIs] that are useful as adhesives, matrices of composite materials, moldings, films, and coatings. PAEs and PIs synthesized according to the invention comprise mixtures of branched, linear, and star-shaped molecules. The monomers of these polymers can be capped with either reactive end groups to obtain thermosets or nonreactive end groups to obtain thermoplastics. The synthesis of a polymeric mixture according to the invention involves the use of a small amount of a trifunctional monomer. In the case of a PAE, the trifunctional monomer is a trihydroxy- containing compound for example, 1, 3, 5 -trihydroxybenzene (THB). In the case of a PI, the trifunctional monomer is a triamine for example, triamino pyrimidine or melamine. In addition to the aforementioned trifunctional monomer, one uses the difunctional monomers of the conventional formulation of the polymer in question (see figure). In cases of nonreactive end caps, the polymeric mixtures of the invention have <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities</b> and <b>melting</b> temperatures lower than those of the corresponding linear polymers of equal molecular weights. The lower melting temperatures and <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities</b> provide larger processing windows. In cases of reactive end caps, the polymeric mixtures of the invention have lower <b>melt</b> <b>viscosities</b> before curing and the higher cross-link densities after curing (where branching in the uncured systems would become cross-links in the cured systems), relative to the corresponding linear polymers of equal molecular weights.

APOs tend to have lower <b>melt</b> <b>viscosity,</b> better adhesion, longer open times and slow set times than comparable EVAs.

APP is harder than APE, which is harder than APB, which is harder than APH, in accordance with decreasing crystallinity. APOs show relatively low cohesion, the entangled polymer chains have fairly high degree of freedom of movement. Under mechanical load, most of the strain is dissipated by elongation and disentanglement of polymer chains, and {{only a small fraction}} reaches the adhesive-substrate interface.
