5|$|Initially, the <b>Māori</b> {{language}} (te reo <b>Māori)</b> {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. <b>Māori</b> were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak <b>Māori.</b> The future of the language {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, <b>Māori</b> was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of <b>Māori</b> people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now <b>Māori</b> language immersion schools and two <b>Māori</b> Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in <b>Māori.</b> Many places have officially been given dual <b>Māori</b> and English names in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The 28th (<b>Māori)</b> Battalion, more {{commonly}} known as the <b>Māori</b> Battalion, was an infantry battalion of the New Zealand Army that served during the Second World War. It was formed following pressure on the Labour government by some <b>Māori</b> Members of Parliament (MPs) and <b>Māori</b> organisations throughout the country which wanted a full <b>Māori</b> unit to be raised for service overseas. The <b>Māori</b> Battalion followed in the footsteps of the <b>Māori</b> Pioneer Battalion that served during the First World War with success, and was wanted by <b>Māori</b> to raise their profile, and to serve alongside their Pākehā compatriots as subjects of the British Empire. It also gave a generation of people with a well-noted military ancestry a chance to test their own warrior skills.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, <b>Māori</b> were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo <b>Māori)</b> in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now <b>Māori</b> language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in <b>Māori.</b> Many places have both their <b>Māori</b> and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of <b>Māori</b> culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and <b>Māori</b> artists are increasing in number and influence. Most <b>Māori</b> carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent <b>Māori</b> architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a multiethnic society, {{and home}} to people of many {{different}} national origins. Originally composed solely of the <b>Māori</b> who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent. In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the <b>Māori</b> had no immunity. By the 1890s, the <b>Māori</b> population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact. The <b>Māori</b> population increased during the twentieth century, though it remains a minority.|$|E
5|$|No known pre-contact <b>Māori</b> {{name for}} New Zealand {{as a whole}} survives, {{although}} the <b>Māori</b> had several names for the North and South Islands; including Te Ika-a-Māui (the fish of Māui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island. Until the early 20th century, <b>Māori</b> also referred to the North Island as Aotearoa, (commonly translated as 'long white cloud'); in modern <b>Māori</b> usage this has become the name for the whole country.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the <b>Māori</b> population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the <b>Māori</b> population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 <b>Māori</b> still identify themselves as adhering to traditional <b>Māori</b> beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among <b>Māori.</b> Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
5|$|As {{recorded}} in the 2013 census, the largest <b>Māori</b> iwi is Ngāpuhi with 125,601 people (or 18.8 percent of people of <b>Māori</b> descent). Since 2006, {{the number of people}} of <b>Māori</b> descent stating Ngāpuhi as their iwi increased by 3,390 people (2.8percent). The second-largest was Ngāti Porou, with 71,049 people (down 1.2percent from 2006). Ngāi Tahu was the largest in the South Island and the third-largest overall, with a count of 54,819 people (an increase of 11.4percent from 2006). A total of 110,928 people (or 18.5percent) of <b>Māori</b> descent did not know their iwi (an increase of 8.4percent compared with 2006). A group of <b>Māori</b> migrated to Rēkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture. The Moriori population was decimated, first, by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and, second, by Taranaki <b>Māori,</b> with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full-blooded Moriori dying in 1933. The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006, but decreased to 738 in 2013.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} one of the first <b>Māori</b> {{admitted}} to the bar, practising as a solicitor, and later as a barrister, Ellison also stood unsuccessfully for the Southern <b>Maori</b> parliamentary seat several times. After contracting tuberculosis in 1904, he was briefly institutionalised before dying later that year.|$|E
5|$|Cook Islands <b>Māori,</b> {{official}}ly named <b>Māori</b> Kūki 'Āirani, {{and also}} known as Rarotongan, is the nation's official language. There are several mutually intelligible dialects, spoken on the fifteen islands. Rakahanga-Manihiki and Penrhyn are examples. The Cook Islands <b>Maori</b> Dictionary was eventually published in 1995 and included language studies by Dr. Jasper Base of the University of London (1957–1985), the compilation assistance of Raututi Taringa (1957–1959), and the works of an Advisory Committee which was established by Dr. Jasper Buse established in 1960. Pukapukan developed in isolation {{on the island of}} Pukapuka and is considered by scholars as a distinct language.|$|E
5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} <b>Māori</b> names with their own, although they retained some <b>Māori</b> names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to <b>Māori</b> names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement <b>Māori</b> and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local <b>Māori</b> and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand geographical names.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>Māori</b> {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced <b>Māori</b> culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, <b>Māori</b> still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and <b>Māori</b> kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was {{involved}} in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to {{the election of the}} First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and <b>Māori</b> began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A <b>Māori</b> protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of <b>Māori</b> culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although <b>Māori</b> claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the Victorian ship HMCSS Victoria was {{dispatched}} {{to help the}} New Zealand colonial government in its war against <b>Māori</b> in Taranaki. Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against <b>Māori</b> fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 a New Zealand <b>Māori</b> side toured Australia {{where they}} played three Test matches. The tour was {{organised}} by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) after <b>Māori</b> players {{were excluded from}} the All Blacks' 1949 tour to apartheid South Africa. Windon appeared in all three Tests, as well as playing for New South Wales against the tourists. He scored a try in all three Tests; the first was won by the <b>Maori,</b> the second a draw, and the third won by Australia.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, a <b>Māori</b> {{cultural}} group from Rotorua performed {{a version of}} the Gangnam Style dance mixed with a traditional <b>Māori</b> haka in Seoul, celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between South Korea and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>Māori</b> {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance. Their meaning {{is not always}} apparent from literal translations {{and they have been}} passed down through oral tradition. Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki names or myths. After European arrival many locations became known as <b>Māori</b> versions of European words or poorly pronounced contractions of the original <b>Māori</b> names.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} <b>Māori</b> names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original <b>Māori</b> names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and <b>Māori</b> names or, in a few rare cases, dual <b>Māori</b> names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians {{settled in}} the islands that later were named New Zealand and {{developed}} a distinctive <b>Māori</b> culture. In 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of Britain and <b>Māori</b> chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a Dominion. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous <b>Māori</b> are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from <b>Māori</b> and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, <b>Māori</b> and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant.|$|E
5|$|The 28th (<b>Māori)</b> Battalion had {{its origins}} {{before the start}} of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir Āpirana Ngata started to discuss {{proposals}} for the formation of a military unit made up of <b>Māori</b> volunteers similar to the <b>Māori</b> Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War. This proposal was furthered by two <b>Māori</b> MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, and from this support within the <b>Māori</b> community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills. At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Maori</b> {{used the}} wing {{bones of the}} {{albatross}} to carve flutes.|$|E
5|$|The first Europeans {{known to}} have reached New Zealand were Dutch {{explorer}} Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642. In a hostile encounter, four crew members were killed {{and at least one}} <b>Māori</b> was hit by canister shot. Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons and other goods for timber, <b>Māori</b> food, artefacts and water. The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed <b>Māori</b> agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns. The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 <b>Māori.</b> From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the <b>Māori</b> population. The <b>Māori</b> population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} in {{the decline of the}} kakapo was the arrival of humans. <b>Māori</b> {{folklore}} suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early <b>Māori</b> times. <b>Māori</b> hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the <b>Māori</b> and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or kiore, which the <b>Māori</b> brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by <b>Māori</b> reduced the habitable range for kakapo. Although the kakapo was extinct {{in many parts of the}} islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} {{assembling}} {{a team of}} <b>Māori</b> footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph Warbrick, a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884. He initially proposed a team of <b>Māori</b> or part-Māori to play the touring British side in 1888; this developed into a venture to have a <b>Māori</b> team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful. Hearing of Warbrick's plans, civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which Warbrick accepted. When James Scott, a publican, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted {{on the right side}} of the bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a <b>Māori</b> place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green 'grass' and a <b>Māori</b> name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a <b>Māori</b> name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Across {{classical}} music to easy listening, folk and pop style songs, Westenra has performed songs in English, <b>Māori,</b> Irish, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Portuguese, Latin, Japanese, Standard Mandarin Chinese, Catalan, and Taiwanese Hokkien.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous <b>Māori</b> population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 <b>Maori</b> chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the <b>Maori</b> and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|Haane Te Rauawa Manahi DCM (28 September 191329 March 1986) was a New Zealand {{soldier of}} Te Arawa and Ngāti Raukawa descent {{who served in}} the Second World War {{as a member of the}} <b>Māori</b> Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Governor of the new British colony of New South Wales which according to his commission included New Zealand. The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern <b>Māori.</b> In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection. Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from <b>Māori)</b> and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the <b>Māori.</b> The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa, Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for <b>Māori</b> to sign. With {{the signing of the}} Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{alternative}} {{names were}} formalised {{for the two}} main islands, as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu, with either English or <b>Māori</b> name being used {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 King's Birthday Honours, Kippenberger was {{appointed}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The same year, {{he was also}} elected Dominion President of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA), a position he would hold until 1955. While serving as RSA president, he courted controversy by his outspoken opposition to the All Blacks tour of South Africa in 1949, {{on the basis of}} the exclusion of <b>Maori</b> players from the team. While forced to apologise for his remarks, he received much support from <b>Maori</b> veterans.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013 census, 74.0% of New Zealand {{residents}} identified ethnically as European, and 14.9% as <b>Māori.</b> Other major {{ethnic groups}} include Asian (11.8%) and Pacific peoples (7.4%), two-thirds of whom {{live in the}} Auckland Region.|$|E
5|$|Most New Zealand place-names {{are derived}} from <b>Māori</b> and British sources. Both groups used names to commemorate notable people, events, places from their homeland, and their ships, or to {{describe}} the surrounding area. The <b>Māori</b> {{did not have a}} collective name for New Zealand before European arrival, but post-colonisation the name Aotearoa (commonly translated as 'long white cloud') was used to refer to the whole country. Dutch cartographers named the islands Nova Zeelandia and British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Wars were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} {{that took place in}} New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The two conflicts where soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross were the First Taranaki War of 18601861 and the Waikato-Hauhau <b>Māori</b> War of 18631866. The First Taranaki War was fought over land rights on New Zealand's North Island. The local Colonial Governor had set up a policy whereby the British Government could buy local land, and anyone refusing to sell their land would be committing treason against the Crown. When the Te Atiawa refused to sell their land, the British Army attacked on 17 March 1860, starting the First Taranaki War. After {{a series of}} sieges by the British, a truce was signed with the <b>Māori</b> people in March 1861; the disputed land became British-owned territory but it remained in possession of the <b>Māori</b> people. The First Taranaki War ended in a stalemate over the one area of disputed land. By 1863 the influx of settlers and consequent demand for land led to further conflict. In July 1863, the British Army and the Auckland Militia launched the Invasion of Waikato against the forces of Tāwhiao and the <b>Māori</b> King Movement. The British expelled the <b>Māori</b> people from their lands, swiftly moving south, culminating in the defeat and flight of Tāwhiao at Ōrākau in March 1864. The British pursued him across the country as far as the fourth Waikato defensive line, which later became the border of King Country.|$|E
5|$|The Waikato <b>Māori</b> had {{withdrawn}} to fortified positions at Pikopiko and Paterangi by early 1864. While their positions were under siege, war parties would mount raids on {{small groups of}} British soldiers. On 11 February, soldiers of the 40th Regiment of Foot were bathing in the Mangapiko Stream near Paterangi and were ambushed by a raiding party. Heaphy, commanding some men of the 50th Regiment of Foot, came {{to the aid of}} the defenders and moved to cut off the <b>Māori</b> line of retreat. He then overcame the <b>Māori</b> reserve, before leading his men to the ambush site, to assist the British soldiers. Despite being outnumbered, the British repulsed the <b>Māori</b> and began to pursue them into the bush. A soldier was wounded and Heaphy and three others went to his aid but Heaphy and one of the others were wounded and a third was killed. Unable to extricate themselves, Heaphy and the remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent the wounded men from being axed by the <b>Māori.</b> They were eventually relieved by reinforcements but the two wounded men that Heaphy and the soldier were trying to protect, died of their wounds. Despite injuries to his arm, hip and ribs, Heaphy remained in the field for much of the remainder of the day, until the ambushed party was relieved. Following the action at Paterangi, Heaphy was promoted to major; a month later, {{with the end of the}} war in the Waikato, he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life.|$|E
5|$|The area of Princes Street {{between the}} Exchange and Market Reserve was a {{frequent}} source of dispute {{in the early years}} of European settlement. This area, at that time on the foreshore of Otago Harbour was a traditional landing site for <b>Māori</b> waka. Captain Cargill, the founder of the new city, wished to follow the British practice of keeping the foreshore as public land. As the town spread, the area around the landing site became populated by settlers, and visiting <b>Maori</b> relied on the coastal strip as a place to set up their encampments. The southern Commissioner for Crown Lands, Walter Mantell noted the problem and proposed to his superiors in Wellington that a site be found at which the <b>Māori</b> could erect permanent structures, naming the Princes Street foreshore as the preferred site. Mantell and Cargill, who had been bitter political opponents for the control of the early settlement, quickly found themselves at loggerheads over the proposal, and disputes over the ownership and allocation of the land dragged on for over two decades, finally being settled in the courts in 1877.|$|E
