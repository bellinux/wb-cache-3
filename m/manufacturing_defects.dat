25|$|The interstage, which {{connects the}} upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber {{aluminum}} core composite structure. Separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The Falcon9 tank walls and domes are made from aluminium-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all-friction stir welded tank, a technique which minimizes <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> and reduces cost, according to a NASA spokesperson. The second-stage tank of Falcon9 is simply a shorter version of the first-stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 1997, a Maersk Air Boeing 737 {{aircraft}} {{operated by}} British Airways and with 63 passengers and 6 crew on board {{was forced to}} return to the airport after a major failure in the starboard engine. The pilot declared an emergency and the aircraft returned to the airport safely on one engine. It was later found that an engine seal had failed, causing catastrophic engine failure and slight damage to the engine cowling and under-wing surface. The subsequent investigation uncovered design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> with the seals and led to the incorporation of new design seals in all future engines.|$|E

25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects.</b> Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{inherent}} vice, the intrinsic instability {{of the fabric}} and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within {{the fabric of the}} material and therefore is a natural occurrence. Deterioration of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> in the piece. This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.|$|E
25|$|Mistakes are {{sometimes}} made by even a skilled farrier, {{especially if the}} horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming {{too close to the}} sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or nail pricking. This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall and hits the sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of lameness or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These mistakes are made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the hoof wall is particularly thin (common in Thoroughbreds), or if the hoof wall is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.|$|E

2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|E

2500|$|The Nakajima [...] was a single-seat fighter {{flown by}} the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service {{in the last}} two years of World War II. The Allied {{reporting}} name was [...] "Frank"; the Japanese Army designation was [...] The Ki-84 is generally considered the best Japanese fighter to see large-scale operation during the conflict. The aircraft boasted high speeds and excellent maneuverability with an armament (up to two 30mm and two 20mm cannon) that gave it formidable firepower. The Ki-84's performance matched that of any single-engine Allied fighter it faced, while its operational ceiling enabled it to intercept high-flying B-29 Superfortress bombers. Pilots and crews in the field learned to take care with the plane's high-maintenance Nakajima Homare engine and landing gear prone to buckling. The difficulties of Japan's situation late in the war took a toll on the aircraft's overall field performance as <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> multiplied, quality fuel proved difficult to procure, and experienced pilots grew scarce. Even then, the pilot of a well-maintained Ki-84 took to the skies in knowing possession of Japan's fastest fighter. A total of 3,514 aircraft were built.|$|E
2500|$|Another problem {{discovered}} by the jet fighters was unexpectedly dropping a wing at high speeds and high altitudes. This was traced to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> in the wings that made no difference at low speeds and altitudes, but meant that each wing had a slightly different airfoil and hence, a different amount of lift. To counter this Sergey Ilyushin and his team developed a new manufacturing technique that reversed the traditional practice where the internal supporting members were affixed to the assembly jig and the aircraft's skin panels were then attached. This new method meant that the skin panels {{were placed in the}} jigs where the correct curvature and shape could be guaranteed and the internal structure was then fastened to them. This required that manufacturing joints be used along the chord lines of the wings and tail surfaces, which split the spars and ribs in half. [...] Similarly, the fuselage was built the same way, although it was split vertically along the centerline. This new technique did impose a small weight penalty, but had the unexpected advantage of greatly accelerating the assembly process as the internal equipment could be installed before the halves were joined together. This allowed several teams to work on a single sub-assembly before they were mated.|$|E
5000|$|Under <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects,</b> a {{plaintiff}} needs {{to show that}} the autonomous car failed to work as specified by the manufacturer. In the case of autonomous cars, however, this presents a major hurdle because no court has applied <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> to software, which is not something tangible that is manufactured. If a crash stems from a software error, then the traditional product liability law on <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> may not suffice. A greater understanding of how software will be treated under this liability law, particularly when a software error causes physical parts to malfunction, needs to be explored.|$|E
