We consider necessary to improve the analyzed concepts by bringing additional information, as clear and comprehensive as possible, information used as reference {{in the preparation of}} financial statements.   Moreover, is crucial to apply an unitary thinking of the accounting referential which is linked to these {{accounting principles}}. The research methods used in analyzing the principles are: documentation of theoretical study of normative acts in the field of accounting, observation, comparative analysis, synthesis, information classification and data interpretation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary {{examination of the}} extent to which the UK’s leading house builders are embracing the concept of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> commissioning independent external assurance as part of their sustainability reporting processes and to offer some wider reflections on <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance in sustainability reporting. The paper begins with a review of the characteristics of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance and a brief outline of house building in the UK and of the sustainability challenges the industry faces. The information on which the paper is based is drawn for the top twenty UK house builders’ corporate Websites. The research reveals that only a minority of the UK’s top 20 house builders had embraced materiality or commissioned some form of independent external assurance or verification as an integral part of their sustainability reporting processes. In many ways this reduces the reliability and credibility of the house builders’ sustainability reports. Looking to the future growing stakeholder pressure may force the UK’s house builders to embrace <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> commission external assurance as systematic and integral elements in the sustainability reporting process. The paper {{provides a}}n accessible review of the current status of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance in the UK house builders’ sustainability reporting process, and as such it will interest professionals, practitioners, academics and students interested in sustainability in the construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present the issues of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> audit risk within the {{activity}} of financial audit. The concepts of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> audit risk are described from a theoretical perspective, providing approaches found within the national and international literature and within the specific legislation. A case study on the calculation of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> audit risk for an entity is presented in the last part of the article. Through the theoretical approach and the case study, it was concluded that materiality has an important role in determining the type of report to be issued, that is why it can be considered helpful for those involved in the audit process. audit, statutory audit, materiality, audit risk, opinion, audit report, financial statements...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{builds up}} a three part {{genealogy}} {{of the theoretical}} apprehensions of space through a three part narrative of a recently constructed public square, serving as the gateway to Edinburgh's new financial quarter, the Exchange. The aim of this genealogy and its narrative counterparts is to re-imagine {{the ways in which}} public spaces in the urban environment can be understood with reference to their <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> use or non- use. This re-imagining aims to move away from all subjective accounts that focus only on varying degrees of use and the use-value of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> can lend themselves all to easily to ideals and aspirations of city planners and various scripted political projects. The thesis argues that of key importance in this re-imagining is to give space a clear role to play in its own apprehension. The argument of the thesis is that in order to apprehend public spaces in terms of their own materiality at one with use, a detailing of their <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> use or non-use is insufficient if set up in juxtaposition to each other or made to interact through a dialectical confrontation. The thesis maintains that a strong empirical focus on the relations between <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> use or non-use, on the most general level, will yield the most productive way of apprehending public spaces in terms of not reducing interactions between its <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> use or non-use to a scripted theatre of determined functions and their subversion...|$|R

From the very beginnings of modernity until the present the relation of time, matter or <b>materiality,</b> <b>and</b> memory has remained unsettled. While the mainstream memory studies (e. g.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a brief for {{property}} occupiers who look to monitor trends in sustainability reporting. The paper offers a preliminary examination of the extent to which the UK’s leading commercial property companies are embracing the concept of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> commissioning independent external assurance as a part of their sustainability reporting processes and some wider reflections on <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance in sustainability reporting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a review of the characteristics of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance and an outline of the drivers for, and challenges to, sustainability for property companies. The information on which the paper is based is drawn from the leading UK property companies’ corporate websites. Findings – The paper reveals that approximately half of the UK’s leading property companies had embraced materiality or commissioned some form of independent external assurance as an integral part of their sustainability reporting processes. In many ways, this reduces the reliability and credibility of the leading property companies’ sustainability reports. Looking to the future, growing stakeholder pressure may persuade more of the UK’s leading property companies to embrace <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> commission external assurance as systematic and integral elements in the sustainability reporting process. Originality/value – The paper provides an accessible review of the current status of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance among the UK’s leading commercial property companies’ sustainability reporting. As such, it will not only interest occupiers but also professionals, practitioners, academics and students interested in sustainability in the property industry...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to provide a {{preliminary}} examination {{of the extent to}} which Europe’s leading commercial property companies are embracing the concept of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> commissioning independent external assurance as part of their sustainability reporting processes and to offer some wider reflections on <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance in sustainability reporting. The paper begins with an introduction to corporate sustainability,an outline of the European property market and of the drivers for, and challenges to, sustainability for property companies and a review of the characteristics of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> external assurance. The information on which the paper is based is drawn from the leading European commercial property companies’ corporate web sites. The paper reveals that all of Europe’s leading property companies had either reported or provided information on sustainability but that only approximately half of these companies had embraced materiality or commissioned some form of independent external assurance as an integral part of their sustainability reporting processes. In many ways this reduces the reliability and credibility of the leading property companies’ sustainability reports.

Additionally, there is no formal guidance for how to implement the materiality concepts discussed in the auditing standards.

40|$|While {{time and}} space form a classic duality in social science, this article {{demonstrates}} a perspective on time, space <b>and</b> <b>materiality</b> as a core trinity. As a prominent figure in contemporary discussions on materiality {{in the social sciences}} Science and Technology Studies (STS) emphasizes relational approaches. STS however lacks a clear relational definition of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> tends instead to focus on the agency of entities, on for instance material agency. The article suggests a relational definition of <b>materiality</b> <b>and</b> notes that this move implies turning the question of the time of materiality into an empirical question. It is argued that relational materiality must be studied spatially, and thus a spatial approach describing patterns of relations is presented. Based on field work in a primary school classroom and computer lab, three materials are analyzed: the blackboard, a bed-loft and an online 3 D virtual environment. The empirical descriptions depict three different <b>materialities,</b> <b>and</b> it is shown how time is formed differently in each of them. Time, it is argued, is an emergent and characterizing aspect of materialities as spatial formations. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 07012...|$|R

40|$|<b>Materialities</b> <b>and</b> Mobilities in Education {{develops}} new {{arguments about}} the ways in which educational processes can be analysed. Drawing on a recent interest in mobilities across the social sciences, and a conterminous resurgence in academic accounts of materialities, the book demonstrates how these two ostensibly differing perspectives on education might be fruitfully deployed in tandem. Considering the interaction <b>and</b> convergence of <b>materialities</b> <b>and</b> mobilities, the book highlights the relationship between structural constraints and opportunities and the agency of individuals, providing a unique and essential insight into contemporary education. Examining a range of education spaces from the formal to the informal and the different types of mobility that manifest in relation to education, the book introduces readers to a range of theoretical resources and detailed case studies used to analyse the spatiality of education from across the disciplines of human geography, education and sociology. Drawing on material from across the globe, <b>Materialities</b> <b>and</b> Mobilities in Education is an engaging and relevant text, which will appeal to postgraduate students, researchers and academics interested in the development of education policy and practice...|$|R
