40|$|A {{very large}} (10 's of meters) {{aperture}} space telescope including two separate spacecraft [...] an optical primary {{functioning as a}} <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> and an optical secondary functioning as an eyepiece. The spacecraft are spaced up to several kilometers apart with the eyepiece directly behind the <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> ''aiming'' at an intended target with their relative orientation determining the optical axis of the telescope and hence the targets being observed. The <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> includes a very large-aperture, very-thin-membrane, diffractive lens, e. g., a Fresnel lens, which intercepts incoming light over its full aperture and focuses it towards the eyepiece. The eyepiece has a much smaller, meter-scale aperture and is designed to move along the focal surface of the <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass,</b> gathering up the incoming light and converting it to high quality images. The positions of the two space craft are controlled both to maintain a good optical focus and to point at desired targets...|$|R
