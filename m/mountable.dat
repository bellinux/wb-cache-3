25|$|An {{analysis}} of the New Zealand national crash database for the period 1996–2000 shows that 26% of cyclists reported injury crashes happened at roundabouts, compared to 6% at traffic signals and 13% at priority controlled junctions. The New Zealand researchers propose that low vehicle speeds, circulatory lane markings and <b>mountable</b> centre aprons for trucks can reduce the problem.|$|E
25|$|Timbales are tuned {{much higher}} than a tom of the same diameter, and {{normally}} played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than a tom, but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms. Attack timbales and mini timbales are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae & numerous world music styles. Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The single-headed <b>mountable</b> drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20-24 inches in diameter), but has the same purpose {{as that of a}} floor tom.|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or <b>mountable</b> apron.|$|E
2500|$|The bazantar is a five-string {{double bass}} with 29 {{sympathetic}} and 4 drone strings {{and has a}} melodic range of five octaves invented by musician Mark Deutsch, {{who worked on the}} design between 1993 and 1997 ( [...] issued March 16, 1999).

2500|$|Two median types were considered: a {{concrete}} barrier wall and a depressed grass median. <b>Mountable</b> medians {{in rural areas}} are not recommended.

2500|$|Specific {{features}} found beneficial {{were the}} local processing facilities, compilers, editors, a document preparation system, efficient file system and access control, <b>mountable</b> and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as special files, {{integration of the}} network control program (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of network connections as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix I/O calls, closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be [...] "desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel".|$|E
2500|$|Many lenses are <b>mountable,</b> [...] "diaphragm-and-meter-compatible", {{on modern}} DSLRs and on older film SLRs {{that use the}} same lens mount. However, when lenses {{designed}} for 35mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens {{appears to have a}} longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full frame sensors or 35mm film because of the smaller imaging circle and, with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the reflex mirrors on full-frame bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Joshua Slocum was {{the first}} single-handed yachtsman to {{successfully}} pass this way (in 1895) although in the end, extreme weather forced him {{to use some of}} the inshore routes between the channels and islands and it is believed he did not actually pass outside the Horn proper. If one had to go by strict definitions, the first small boat to sail around outside Cape Horn was the [...] yacht Saoirse, sailed by Conor O'Brien with three friends, who rounded it during a circumnavigation of the world between 1923 and 1925. In 1934, the Norwegian Al Hansen {{was the first}} to round Cape Horn single-handed from east to west — the [...] "wrong way" [...] — in his boat Mary Jane, but was subsequently wrecked on the coast of Chile. The first person to successfully circumnavigate the world single-handed via Cape Horn was Argentinian Vito Dumas, who made the voyage in 1942 in his [...] ketch Lehg II; a number of other sailors have since followed him, including Webb Chiles aboard [...] "" [...] who in December 1975 rounded Cape Horn single-handed. On March 31, 2010, 16-year-old Abby Sunderland became the youngest person to single-handedly sail around Cape-Horn in her attempt to circumnavigate the globe. In 1987 The British Cape Horn Expedition, headed by Nigel H Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing kayaks' called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails <b>mountable</b> in any four of the sailing positions between the two kayaks.|$|E
