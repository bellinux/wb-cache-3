25|$|On {{the night}} of April 4/morning of April 5, 20-year-old Julie Kerry, 19-year-old Robin Kerry, and their 19-year-old cousin, Thomas Cummins, were on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River. Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemons, and Daniel Winfrey went to the bridge that night together. The two groups, {{who did not know}} each other, had a brief conversation. Gray showed the other group how to climb down a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> on the bridge down to the pier. Then the two groups separated.|$|E

25|$|In January 2017, three utility {{workers in}} Key Largo, Florida, died {{one by one}} within seconds of {{descending}} into a narrow space beneath a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> to check a section of paved street, the hole was filled with hydrogen sulfide and methane gas created from years of rotted vegetation. In an attempt to save the men, a firefighter who entered the hole without his air tank (because he could not fit through the hole with it) collapsed within seconds {{and had to be}} rescued by a colleague. The firefighter was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital and later recovered.|$|E
25|$|Lodner D. Phillips {{designed}} the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included {{ball and socket}} joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators {{at the ends of}} the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|After the U.S. Army's use of {{the island}} for over 80 years (1850–1933), the island came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Department of Justice for use by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The purpose of this transfer was to punish those involved in the rampant crime which prevailed in the country in the 1920s and 1930s. The United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a Federal Bureau of Prisons federal prison in August 1934. The $260,000 conversion to the federal prison took place from January 1934. George Hess of the United States Public Health Service was appointed the chief medical officer of the prison and Edward W. Twitchell became a consultant in psychiatry for Alcatraz in January 1934. The hospital facilities were checked by three officials from the Marine Hospital of San Francisco. The Bureau of Prisons personnel arrived on Alcatraz in early February; among them was Loring O. Mills, acting chief clerk. In April 1934, the old material was removed from the prison, holes were cut in the concrete and 269 cell fronts were installed, built using four carloads of steel ordered from the Stewart Iron Works. A legend at the works is that a shipment of cells and iron accidentally fell into San Francisco Bay during transportation from San Francisco Dock to Alcatraz and were never recovered, and thus had to be reordered. Two of four new stairways were built, as were 12 doors to the utility corridors and gratings at the top of the cells. On April 26, an accidental small fire broke out on the roof and an electrician injured his foot by dropping a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> on it. Fencing around Alcatraz was added by the Anchor Post Fence Company and emergency lighting in the morgue and switchboard operations were added by the Enterprise Electric Works. In June 1934, the Teletouch Corporation of New York began the installation of an [...] "electro-magnetic gun or metal detecting system" [...] at Alcatraz; detectors were added on the wharf, at the front entrance into the cellblock, and at the rear entrance gate. The correctional officers were instructed how to operate the new locking devices on July 30, 1934, and the new radio equipment was tested by both the United States Coast Guard and the San Francisco Police Department on the same day. Final checks and assessments were made on the first two days of August.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{factors that}} {{occurred}} {{on that day}} and the previous days might {{have contributed to the}} disaster. The tank was constructed poorly and tested insufficiently. Due to fermentation occurring within the tank, carbon dioxide production might have raised the internal pressure. The rise in local temperatures that occurred over the previous day also would have assisted in building this pressure. Records show that the air temperature rose from [...] over that period. The failure occurred from a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> near the base of the tank, and [...] a fatigue crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality.

2500|$|According to Weeks,"Billy O'Sullivan's death {{might not}} have {{happened}} if he had listened to Jimmy. Billy O had been with Jimmy against the Mullins and had shot Buddy Roache during the gang war. Buddy, whose brother Mickey later became Boston's police commissioner, ended up crippled and in a wheelchair. In March 1971, not long after he shot the wrong McGonagle, Jimmy went to New York to pick up guns. Before he left, he told Billy to be careful while he was gone and not to drink. But that night, Billy hung around with Kevin O'Neil down at the Transit Cafe and ended up drunk. Kevin offered him a ride home, but Billy refused the offer. Heading home, He was chased {{by a couple of}} men with the Mullins gang who caught up with him when he tripped over a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> about 200 yards from his house and fell down.

40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of small objects from aerial images {{is a difficult}} signal processing task. To localise small objects in an image, low-complexity geometry-based approaches can be used, but their efficiency is often low. Another option is to use appearance-based approaches that give better results but require a costly learning step. In this paper, we treat the specific case of <b>manhole</b> <b>covers.</b> Currently many <b>manholes</b> are not listed or are badly positioned on maps. We implement two conventional previously published methods to detect <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> in images. The first one searches for circular patterns in the image while the second uses machine learning to build a model of <b>manhole</b> <b>covers.</b> The results show non optimal performances for each method. The two approaches are combined to overcome this limit, thus increasing the overall performance by about forty percent...|$|R
2500|$|The reopening of the Lucy Tongue Level {{was agreed}} to in 1993 {{by the present}} owners of the mine, the Lake District Special Planning Board (LDSPB), part of the National Park Authority. Groups of enthusiasts collaborated to dig through {{the roof of the}} level from above the {{original}} entrance, and installed a large concrete pipe with a lockable <b>manhole</b> <b>cover.</b> They were able to follow the level as far as [...] "Low Arches," [...] where it turned west into the Clay Vein. This soft vein had always been bad ground which needed supporting and roofing, and parts of it had collapsed. By 1996 the level had been cleared for [...] through this area. Eventually it was cleared right through, with the debris being bagged up and stacked {{along the side of the}} level. In 2003 there was another major collapse in the Lucy Tongue Level, just south of Smith's Shaft. This involved another major operation to clear it and install steel supports. Explorers can now pass right through the mine, in at the Glencoyne Level and out from the Lucy Tongue Level.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 July 1988 John Stephens, {{a relief}} tanker driver working for Bristol-based {{distribution}} firm ISC, arrived at Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor {{and found it}} unmanned. Being unfamiliar with the location, {{he had been given}} a key by another driver and told simply that [...] "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the South West Water Authority (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank. He poured the load of 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists. The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{testimony}} {{offered on}} behalf of the prosecution, several minutes later the group of four men decided to rob the three, with Winfrey testifying that Gray said he [...] "felt like hurting somebody." [...] They returned and Gray told Cummins that [...] "This is a robbery. Get down on the ground." [...] The two girls were grabbed and held on the ground. Richardson held Julie down while Clemons raped her and then the two swapped positions. Gray, Richardson, and Clemons then alternately raped Robin and Julie. Cummins was then robbed of his wallet, wristwatch, cash, and keys, and the three victims were forced down the <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> to the concrete pier. The two Kerry sisters then were pushed, and Cummins jumped as instructed. Medical witnesses testified that Cummins and Julie Kerry survived the [...] fall to the water below. Cummins testified that after surfacing, the current pulled him over to Julie, but then she drifted off after he began to drown. Cummins swam to shore and survived. The body of Julie Kerry was found three weeks later near Caruthersville, Missouri; the body of Robin Kerry was not found.|$|E
