40|$|The most {{remarkable}} variable cycle {{characteristic of the}} variable cycle engine (VCE) is that it keeps airflow almost constant during subsonic cruise throttling by modulating variable geometries, which can efficiently decrease spillage drag and increase installed thrust. One {{of the most critical}} challenges for the modulation lies in completely maintaining airflow, as well as avoiding specific fuel consumption (SFC) degradation during throttling. This has resulted in a need to investigate the modulation regulation of the adaptive cycle engine (ACE) which is a new concept for VCE and has greater potential for flexibly modulating airflow and pressure ratio. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} study the variable geometries’ <b>modulation</b> <b>schedule</b> of ACE in maintaining airflow during throttling. A configuration of an ACE concept and its modeling study are first put forward. Then, the control schedule is researched via the combination of sensibility analysis and basic working principle instead of optimizing them directly. Results show that when the net thrust decreases from 100 % to about 55 % during subsonic cruise and to 32 % during the supersonic cruise, the demand airflow of the engine is kept almost constant, which greatly improves the installed performance during throttling...|$|E

40|$|Third {{generation}} wireless systems typically employ {{adaptive coding}} and <b>modulation,</b> <b>scheduling,</b> and Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) techniques to provide high-speed packet data {{service on the}} downlink.

We propose a systematic approach to optimize the mapping between signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to maximize the throughput by taking into account the type of HARQ scheme employed. We also propose to incorporate frame error rate (FER) and retransmission information {{as a part of the}} scheduling decision. The proposed scheduler ranking methods based on using an effective rate rather than the instantaneous rate provide natural priority to retransmissions over new transmissions, and priority to users with better channel quality.

Traditionally, the fading is considered as an unreliability source which should be mitigated. In the multiuser diversity context, however, the channel fading has a positive impact and is helpful for improving the system performance[1 – 19]. This is because in a system {{with a number of}} users experiencing independent fading conditions, {{it is more likely that}} at each time instant, one of the users experiences good channel quality.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{performance aspects}} of adaptive <b>modulation</b> and <b>scheduling</b> {{as the amount}} of channel feedback is reduced. We study throughput, fairness and the sensitivity to incorrect channel quantizations. A main finding is that the throughput of a cellular downlink using strict multiuser diversity does not degrade significantly when the channel information is heavily quantized. On the other hand, unfairness increases and due to an inherent sensitivity to incorrectly chosen quantization levels there is a risk of occasional drastic performance drops. Noting that fixed-access schemes do not have the bad properties of multiuser diversity, but achieve unsatisfactory throughput, we propose a scheme combining the good aspects of multiuser diversity with the desirable properties of fixed access schemes. The result is a low-complexity scheduler and quantization policy that achieve large throughput gains as compared to fixed access without compromising fairness. I...|$|R

30|$|The {{overview}} {{we propose}} {{in this article}} is definitely not the first on this topic. The concerns about energy efficiency are something that quickly grows worldwide. We can say that the last decade was a period of progressive awakening and rapid awareness on the subject. To the best of authors' knowledge, a first survey on the topic was published in the year 2001 [12]. This survey explored the different advances and research approaches for wireless networks following each one of the layers of the wireless protocols stack going beyond the typical approach to physical layer, emphasising at that moment that higher savings could be achieved if also upper layer processes are optimised. Another survey in the domain of energy-efficiency techniques for mobile systems was proposed in 2004 [10] and it remains today a good entry point for this topic. This reference gives a wide overview of energy-efficiency mechanisms for wireless network, mainly WLAN and cellular networks, taking into account hardware, architectures and protocols. Some surveys were written in the framework of collaborative projects (see Section 8) such as [13] from the EARTH project or [14] from Mobile VCE Core 5 giving the future challenges and perspectives. A parallel overview of EARTH and Green Touch projects is presented in [15]. These surveys devote their work to describe what has been done so far within their projects, showing their own present and future steps of development. Some other surveys are dedicated to specific approaches like, for example, MIMO as presented in [16]. The authors of [17] focus on energy-efficient transmission, discussing the research on some techniques like MIMO, OFDM/OFDMA, adaptive <b>modulation,</b> <b>scheduling,</b> etc. In this article, the radio resource allocation and transmission mechanisms are viewed from three different perspectives: space, frequency and time domain. The survey presented in [18] studies similar topics with [17] (e.g. MIMO and OFDMA); however, it includes a short discussion about relaying. We can also mention the exhaustive work of compilation and synthesis of [19] dedicated to the energy efficiency of fixed networks with an impressive list of more than 150 references.|$|R

40|$|In {{multiuser}} wireless radio systems, it may {{be possible}} to increase throughput by reducing the feedback-rate of channel quality data while meeting quality of service requirements. By Thomas Eriksson and Tony Ottosson ABSTRACT | For wireless systems with adaptive <b>modulation</b> and/or <b>scheduling,</b> feedback of channel quality information is often necessary. It has been questioned whether the increased system performance is worth the additional feedback rate and the increased algorithm complexity. In this paper, we study how the feedback rate can be minimized, without losing the gains due to adaptive modulation and multiuser diversity. We present an in-depth study of the literature in the area, and evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art channel quality feedback schemes. By illustrating the compromise between system throughput and feedback channel rate for various schemes, we are able to give valuable insight in choice of method for feedback rate reduction. A major conclusion is that for multicarrier systems, a lossy compression scheme is the best choice, while for single-carrier systems, schemes limiting feedback to only high-SNR users show good performance. Another conclusion is that there are still many issues to study before the schemes can be used in practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{throughput}} {{gained by}} employing adaptive <b>modulation</b> and <b>scheduling</b> in cellular communications systems {{depend on the}} amount of channel feedback used {{and the quality of the}} quantization of the channel information. We discuss the implications of using a rate quantization which maximizes the expected down-link throughput, and give a procedure for choosing the optimal number of bits for feedback. It turns out that unless the number of users is much less than the number of symbols that constitute a time slot, no more than 1 bit should be used for feedback. We also note that utilizing multiuser diversity, i. e. scheduling transmissions to increase throughput, has a theoretical performance advantage as compared to fixed channel access when the amount of channel information is reduced. On the other hand, unfairness increases, and due to an inherent sensitivity to incorrectly chosen quantization levels, there is a risk of occasional drastic performance drops, to levels below that of fixed access. We further investigate on-line adaptation of quantization levels as the channels and the number of users vary. A scheduling and adaptive quantization policy for high throughput and quality-of-service requirements in terms of hard inter-access bounds is developed which is shown to combine the advantages of multiuser diversity without compromising fairness. The policy is well-suited for the multiple-channel case, gives a considerable throughput gain with little channel feedback, and facilitates real-time services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Applying {{adaptive}} <b>modulation</b> {{combined with}} <b>scheduling</b> in a shared data channel can substantially improve the spectral efficiency for wireless systems. This performance gain {{results from the}} multiuser diversity, which exploited independent channel variations across multiple users. In this paper, we present a cross-layer analysis to integrate physical-layer channel characteristics, media access control (MAC) layer scheduling strategies, and the network layer issue of heterogeneous traffic intensity across near–far users. Specifically, for radio channel characteristics, we take account of path loss, slowly varying log-normal shadowing and fast-varying Nakagami fading. We also evaluate the impact of selective transmit diversity on the throughput and fairness of wireless data networks. Furthermore, we consider three MAC schedulers: random scheduler, greedy scheduler (GS), and a newly proposed queue-length-based scheduler (QS). By applying the proposed cross-layer analytical framework, the following insights can be gained. First, for the three considered schedulers, channel fluctuations induced by Nakagami fading or log-normal shadowing can improve both total throughput and fairness. Second, using selective transmit diversity can improve throughput, but is unfavorable for the fairness performance. Third, the GS and the QS methods can improve throughput {{at the expense of}} unfairness to the far users. However, the throughput improvement from using the GS and the QS decreases as the traffic intensity of the far user increases. In summary, this cross-layer analysis can be used to develop new scheduling mechanisms for achieving better tradeoff between the fairness and throughput for wireless data networks.

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) {{has become}} a widely adopted {{modulation}} technique in modern communications systems due to its multipath resilience and low implementation complexity. The direct conversion architecture is a popular candidate for low-cost, low-power, fully integrated transceiver designs. One of the inevitable problems associated with analog signal processing in direct conversion involves the mismatches in the gain and phases of In-phase (I) and Quadrature-phase (Q) branches. Ideally, the I and Q branches of the quadrature mixer will have perfectly matched gains and are orthogonal in phase. Due to imperfect implementation of the electronics, so called I/Q imbalance emerges and creates interference between subcarriers which are symmetrically apart from the central subcarrier. With practical imbalance levels, basic transceivers fail to maintain the sufficient image rejection, which in turn can cause interference with the desired transmission. Such an I/Q distortion degrades the systems performance if left uncompensated. Moreover, the coexistence of I/Q imbalance and other analog RF imperfections with digital baseband and higher layer functionalities such as multiantenna transmission and radio resource management, reduce the probability of successful transmission. Therefore, mitigation of I/Q imbalance is an essential substance in designing and implementing modern communications systems, while meeting required performance targets and quality of service. This thesis considers techniques to compensate and mitigate I/Q imbalance, when combined with channel estimation, multiantenna transmission, transmission power control, adaptive <b>modulation</b> and multiuser <b>scheduling.</b> The awareness of the quantitative relationship between transceiver parameters and system parameters is crucial in designing and dimensioning of modern communications systems.
