5|$|Ventricular <b>myosin</b> light chain-2 (MLC-2v) {{refers to}} the {{ventricular}} cardiac muscle form of <b>myosin</b> light chain 2 (Myl2). MLC-2v is a 19-KDa protein composed of 166 amino acids, that belongs to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding superfamily. MLC-2v interacts with the neck/tail region of the muscle thick filament protein <b>myosin</b> to regulate <b>myosin</b> motility and function.|$|E

This cardiac ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and cardiac atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} <b>myosin</b> binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates <b>myosin</b> ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate <b>myosin</b> power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of class I <b>myosins,</b> the first nonmuscle <b>myosins,</b> about 30 years ago, the history of unconventional <b>myosins</b> {{has been linked to}} the organization and working of actin filaments. It slowly emerged from studies of class I <b>myosins</b> in lower eukaryotes that they are involved in mechanisms of endocytosis. Most interestingly, a flurry of recent findings assign a more active role to class I <b>myosins</b> in regulating the spatial and temporal organization of actin filament nucleation and elongation. The results highlight the multiple links between class I <b>myosins</b> and the major actin nucleator, the Arp 2 / 3 complex, and its newly described activators. Two additional types of unconventional <b>myosins,</b> myosinIX, and Dictyostelium discoideum MyoM, have recently been tied to the signaling pathways controlling actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The present review surveys the links between these three classes of molecular motors and the complex cellular processes of endocytosis and actin dynamics, and concentrates on a working model accounting for the function of class I <b>myosins</b> via recruitment of the machinery responsible for actin nucleation and elongation...|$|R

Their cellular localization, their ability to bind membrane vesicles and their ability to produce in vitro movement suggest that they can generate forces on the plasma membrane relative to actin filaments as well as on membrane compartments relative to actin. Genetic approaches and biochemical analysis of cells over-producing nonfunctional domains of unconventional <b>myosins</b> have provided direct evidence for a role of unconventional <b>myosins</b> in movement of intracellular vesicles and have allowed us to formulate hypotheses about the possible mechanisms by which unconventional <b>myosins</b> could participate in the intracellular transport of membrane proteins and secretary proteins...|$|R

The actin cytoskeleton {{is essential for the}} maintenance of cell shape and locomotion, and also provides tracks for active intracellular transport. <b>Myosins,</b> the actin-dependent motor proteins form a superfamily of at least 15 structural classes and have been identified {{in a wide variety of}} organisms, making the presence of actin and <b>myosins</b> a hallmark feature of eukaryotes. Direct connections of <b>myosins</b> to a variety of cellular tasks are now emerging, such as in cytokinesis, phagocytosis, endocytosis, polarized secretion and exocytosis, axonal transport.

These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.|$|E
5|$|There are {{specific}} proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, <b>myosin,</b> tropomyosin, and troponin. They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 {{that are also}} expressed in skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with <b>myosin</b> hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and <b>myosin</b> in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle.

5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of <b>myosin</b> heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, <b>myosin</b> heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Movement of <b>myosin</b> {{heads over}} the thin filaments, this can either involve ATP or be {{independent}} of ATP. The former mechanism, mediated by ATPase activity in the <b>myosin</b> heads, causes {{the movement of the}} actin filaments towards the Z-disc.|$|E
40|$|About {{a decade}} ago Brownian motors were {{introduced}} as a possible mechanism for motor protein mobility. Since then many theoretical and experimental papers have been published on the topic. While some experiments support Brownian motor mechanisms, others are more consistent with traditional power stroke models. Taking into account recent experimental data and molecular level simulations, we have developed a stochastic model which incorporates both power stroke and Brownian motor mechanisms. Depending on parameter values, this motor works as a power stroker, a Brownian motor or a hybrid of the two. Using this model we investigate the motility of single-head <b>myosins,</b> two-head <b>myosins</b> {{and a group of}} <b>myosins</b> (muscle).

40|$|AbstractThe IQ motif {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in both <b>myosins</b> and non-myosins and {{is quite common}} in the database that includes more than 900 Pfam entries. An examination of IQ motif-containing proteins that are known to bind calmodulin (CaM) indicates a wide diversity of biological functions that parallel the Ca 2 +-dependent targets. These proteins include a variety of neuronal growth proteins, <b>myosins,</b> voltage-operated channels, phosphatases, Ras exchange proteins, sperm surface proteins, a Ras Gap-like protein, spindle-associated proteins and several proteins in plants. The IQ motif occurs in some proteins with Ca 2 +-dependent CaM interaction where it may promote Ca 2 +-independent retention of CaM. The action of the IQ motif may result in complex signaling as observed for <b>myosins</b> and the L-type Ca 2 + channels and is highly localized as required for sites of neuronal polarized growth and plasticity, fertilization, mitosis and cytoskeletal organization. The IQ motif associated with the unconventional <b>myosins</b> also promotes Ca 2 + regulation of the vectorial movement of cellular constituents to these sites. Additional regulatory roles for this versatile motif seem likely...|$|R

25|$|Protein {{synthesis}} {{and protein}} degradation decline with age in skeletal and heart muscle, {{as would be}} expected, since DNA damage blocks gene transcription. In a recent study Piec et al. found numerous changes in protein expression in rat skeletal muscle with age, including lower levels of several proteins related to <b>myosin</b> and actin. Force is generated in striated muscle by the interactions between <b>myosin</b> thick filaments and actin thin filaments.|$|E
25|$|The NO {{produced}} by {{this process is}} a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase (GC) by heme-dependent mechanisms; this activation results in formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Among other roles, cGMP serves as a substrate for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates <b>myosin</b> light chain phosphatase. Thus, production of NO from exogenous sources such as GTN increases the level of cGMP within the cell, and stimultates dephosphorylation of <b>myosin.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Development of {{the nervous}} system {{requires}} remarkable changes in cell structure that are dependent upon the cytoskeleton. The importance of specific components of the neuronal cytoskeleton, such as microtubules and neurofilaments, to neuronal function and development has been well established. Recently, increasing focus has been put on understanding the functional role of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons. Important modulators of the actin cytoskeleton are the large family of <b>myosins,</b> many of which (classes I, II, III, V, VI, VII, IX, and XV; Fig. 1) are expressed in developing neurons or sensory cells. <b>Myosins</b> are force-producing proteins that have been implicated {{in a wide variety of}} cellular functions in the developing nervous system, including neuronal migration, process outgrowth, and growth cone motility, as well as other aspects of morphogenesis, axonal transport, and synaptic and sensory functions.

40|$|Cell-cell fusion is {{essential}} for fertilization. For fusion of walled cells, the cell wall must be degraded at a precise location but maintained in surrounding regions to protect against lysis. In fission yeast cells, the formin Fus 1, which nucleates linear actin filaments, {{is essential}} for this process. In this paper, we show that this formin organizes a specific actin structure-the actin fusion focus. Structured illumination microscopy and live-cell imaging of Fus 1, actin, and type V <b>myosins</b> revealed an aster of actin filaments whose barbed ends are focalized near the plasma membrane. Focalization requires Fus 1 and type V <b>myosins</b> and happens asynchronously always in the M cell first. Type V <b>myosins</b> are essential for fusion and concentrate cell wall hydrolases, but not cell wall synthases, at the fusion focus. Thus, the fusion focus focalizes cell wall dissolution within a broader cell wall synthesis zone to shift from cell growth to cell fusion...|$|R
40|$|The motor {{properties}} of the two yeast class V <b>myosins,</b> Myo 2 p and Myo 4 p, were examined using in vitro motility assays.

Both <b>myosins</b> have {{properties of}} a nonprocessive motor, unlike chick myosin-Va (M 5 a), which behaves as a processive motor when assayed under identical conditions. Additional support for the idea that Myo 2 p is a nonprocessive motor comes from actin cosedimentation assays, which show that Myo 2 p has a low affinity for F-actin {{in the presence of}} ATP and Ca 2 +, unlike chick brain M 5 a. These studies suggest that if Myo 2 p functions in organelle transport, at least five molecules of Myo 2 p must be present per organelle to promote directed movement...|$|R
25|$|It {{was found}} that NO acts through the {{stimulation}} of the soluble guanylate cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates protein kinase G, which causes reuptake of Ca2+ {{and the opening of}} calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca2+ ensures that the <b>myosin</b> light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the <b>myosin</b> molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.|$|E
25|$|The myosin-binding protein C, cardiac-type is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the MYBPC3 gene. cMyBP-C is a myosin-associated protein that binds at 43nm {{intervals}} along the <b>myosin</b> thick filament backbone, stretching for 200nm {{on either side}} of the M-line within the crossbridge-bearing zone (C-region) of the A band in striated muscle. The approximate stoichiometry of cMyBP-C along the thick filament is 1 per 9-10 <b>myosin</b> molecules, or 37 cMyBP-C molecules per thick filament. In addition to <b>myosin,</b> cMyBP-C also binds titin and actin. The cMyBP-C isoform expressed in cardiac muscle differs from those expressed in slow and fast skeletal muscle (MYBPC1 and MYBPC2, respectively) by three features: (1) an additional immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain on the N-terminus, (2) a linker region between the second and third Ig domains, and (3) an additional loop in the sixth Ig domain. cMyBP-C appears necessary for normal order, filament length and lattice spacing within the structure of the sarcomere.|$|E
25|$|In muscle cells, {{actomyosin}} myofibrils makeup {{much of the}} cytoplasmic material. These myofibrils {{are made}} of thin filaments of actin (typically around 7nm in diameter), and thick filaments of the motor-protein <b>myosin</b> (typically around 15nm in diameter). These myofibrils use energy derived from ATP to create movements of cells, such as muscle contraction. Using the hydrolysis of ATP for energy, <b>myosin</b> heads undergo a cycle during which they attach to thin filaments, exert a tension, and then, depending on the load, perform a power stroke that causes the thin filaments to slide past, shortening the muscle.|$|E
