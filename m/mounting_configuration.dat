50|$|Although the new VVT engine outputs {{the same}} amount of power as the IAFM+ unit previously, it {{features}} a number of mechanical enhancements for reduced noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and improved fuel efficiency. In comparison to the old IAFM+, the new VVT engine has a new block, new pistons, new valves and a longer 10,000 km service interval. It also features variable valve timing in the cylinder head, making the third generation Saga the first in its lineage to offer VVT technology. The engine now sits on a new three-mount configuration, as opposed to the four-mount arrangement in the outgoing Saga models as well as the Iriz. The improved <b>mounting</b> <b>configuration</b> has considerably reduced transmissions of engine vibrations into the cabin. Proton has also fitted a new strut bar in the engine bay, for improved driving dynamics. The ECU has also been calibrated for a more linear throttle response.|$|E

40|$|The JWST Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) {{includes}} a large metering structure (approx. 2 m x 2 m x 1. 5 m) {{that houses the}} science instruments and guider. Stringent dimensional stability and repeatability requirements combined with mass limitations led to {{the selection of a}} composite bonded frame design comprised of biased laminate tubes. Even with the superb material specific stiffness, achieving the required frequency for the given mass allocations in conjunction with severe spatial limitations imposed by the instrument complement has proven challenging. In response to the challenge, the ISIM structure team considered literally over 100 primary structure topology and kinematic <b>mount</b> <b>configurations,</b> and settled on a concept comprised of over 70 m of tubes, over 50 bonded joint assemblies, and a "split bi-pod" kinematic <b>mount</b> <b>configuration.</b> In this paper, we review the evolution of the ISIM primary structure topology and kinematic <b>mount</b> <b>configuration</b> to the current baseline concept...|$|R
50|$|The new BH Persona {{is powered}} by Proton's 1.6-litre VVT S4PH engine, a {{naturally}} aspirated, four-cylinder, 16-valve DOHC petrol unit with variable valve timing. The 1.6-litre VVT, the sole option in the BH Persona, is capable of 107 hp at 5,750 rpm and 150 Nm at 4,000 rpm. Although the engine appears mechanically identical to its previous application in the Iriz, Proton has made further refinements for reduced noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and improved fuel efficiency. The 1.6 L engine in the new Persona is fitted with a three-mount configuration, as opposed to four in the Iriz. Proton claims that the improved <b>mounting</b> <b>configuration</b> has reduced transmissions of engine vibrations into the cabin, and is six decibels quieter {{when compared to the}} equivalent Iriz model. Additionally, the new exhaust system in the BH Persona has remedied exhaust drone at lower revs, and the ECU has been recalibrated for a more linear throttle response. The new VVT engine also has a longer 10,000 km service interval.|$|E
