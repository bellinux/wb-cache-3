25|$|The {{development}} of gay identity may differ {{for men and}} women. For many women, regardless of orientation, female identity {{is more important than}} sexual identity. Where gay <b>men</b> <b>need</b> to distance themselves from heterosexual masculinity, due to the strict enforcement of male roles in Western society, lesbians may be more concerned about sexism than about lesbian identity.|$|E
25|$|In mid-July 1808 {{there was}} a lull in which neither side made a move. At {{the end of the}} month, Junot decided to send Loison to clear a path to Elvas. He {{provided}} Loison with a force that included the 4th and 5th Provisional Dragoons (1,248), two battalions of converged grenadiers (1,100), 12 companies from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 86th Line (1,667), 1st Battalion of the Hanoverian Legion (804), and the 3rd Battalions of the 12th Light (1,253), 15th Light (1,305), and 58th Line (1,428). Though the numbers add up to 8,805, historian Charles Oman wrote that 1,200 <b>men</b> <b>need</b> to be subtracted from the total to account for the detached grenadier companies. The force counted at least 7,000 men and was supported by eight artillery pieces. Loison set out from Lisbon on 25 July.|$|E
500|$|Hilson {{explained}} that she is [...] "stripping down and unwinding" [...] with [...] "Make Love", calling it real and natural. She described it as self-explanatory, saying that it speaks of reviving love and [...] "keeping things very interesting". [...] "A woman has {{to know when to}} set the pace, because that's what <b>men</b> <b>need.</b> So that's what the song is about", she said. Musically, [...] "Make Love" [...] is an R ballad, set in a slinky slow jam groove. Patrick Varine of The Observer-Dispatch referred it to as a [...] "hacky mid-'90s R" [...] song, and its slow tempo was compared to ballads by American singer Ciara. According to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song sees Hilson tapping into her vulnerable side.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after they}} have tended to their wounds, Kwai {{receives}} {{a phone call from}} triad boss Fung, who informs him that three of his <b>men</b> <b>need</b> help, and are with an underground non-registered doctor known as [...] "Old Five". Fung tells Kwai that his men were attacked by three Chinese men and one white man. The four men realize that Fung ordered the hit on Costello's daughter and her family. They head to the dwelling and kill the three attackers but leave Old Five alive, who telephones Fung reporting what had happened. Fung then contacts Kwai, explaining that Costello's son-in-law was handing over Fung's financial reports to the police, and that he only ordered his men to kill the parents. Kwai replies that his syndicate has switched their loyalty from Fung to Costello as a matter of honor.|$|E
500|$|Debate has raged {{regarding}} how unusual this pairing {{was based on}} the couple's age and blood relationship. Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife [...] "Sissy" [...] or [...] "Sis". Another Poe biographer, Kenneth Silverman, contends that though their first-cousin marriage was not unusual, her young age was. It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife. Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn disagreed with this view, citing a fervent love letter to argue that Poe [...] "loved his little cousin not only with the affection of a brother, but also with the passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband." [...] Some scholars, including Marie Bonaparte, have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a virgin. It has been speculated {{that she and her husband}} never consummated their marriage, although no evidence is given. This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee": a [...] "maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee". Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women [...] "in the way that normal <b>men</b> <b>need</b> them", but only as a source of inspiration and care, and that Poe was never interested in women sexually. Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, from the time she turned 16, they had a [...] "normal" [...] married life until the onset of her illness.|$|E
2500|$|Ford's {{incursion}} {{into his}} employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed {{off from the}} most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, {{he spoke of the}} Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that [...] "paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. <b>Men</b> <b>need</b> counsel and <b>men</b> <b>need</b> help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside.

2500|$|August – Minutes from a February 2014 Layton, Utah {{meeting for}} stake leaders were {{released}} without authorization {{in which the}} apostle Tom Perry stated that gay young <b>men</b> <b>need</b> association with [...] "manly things" [...] and strong, vigorous men who know the power they hold. He also stated {{that he does not}} believe that people are born with attractions to those of the same sex, but that it's instead a temptation like any other. He further stated that supporting same-sex marriage would [...] "incriminate" [...] members seeking to renew their temple recommend and that same-sex couples expressing any physical affection during church meetings should be allowed to attend but reprimanded by leaders in private. The importance of opposite-sex marriage was stressed with the statement that Jesus and the prophets believed in it and that allowing evil like this to grow would destroy the basic family unit and bring calamities.|$|E
2500|$|In Hong Kong in 2010 special observances of International Men's Day {{occurred}} on 19 November, {{with the theme}} [...] "Blessed Are The Men". All men were invited to ride for free in the city's Ngong Ping 360 Tung Chung cable cars for a round-trip on 19 November. In the same year an article in China Daily on 3 August asked whether men in China needed their own special day, citing the fact that on International Women's Day all women in China, who accounted for 45 percent of the workforce, get a mandatory half day off by their employer while men had no such day. The article reported on an online survey done by Shanghai Hotline asking [...] "Do <b>men</b> <b>need</b> a holiday for themselves?" [...] – to which 80.24 {{percent of respondents said}} [...] "yes" [...] with many insisting that Shanghai men are tired and deserve a holiday.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Stevens fronted the Everyman Testicular Cancer Awareness [...] campaign. Stevens's {{role was}} notable {{as she was}} the first woman to {{represent}} this campaign. Her television commercial raised eyebrows with its suggestive content that included her telling men to [...] "put one hand down their trousers and give their testicles a good feel". On the commercial, Stevens commented, [...] "Sometimes <b>men</b> <b>need</b> a little encouragement to think about their health. This is a funny way of raising awareness about a serious subject." [...] In 2005 Stevens also took part in the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to eliminate poverty in developing countries by cancelling old debts, improving the way aid is given and removing barriers, so these countries can trade more effectively {{with the rest of the}} world. Stevens donated an undisclosed amount of money to the campaign, and also starred in television and magazine advertisements supporting the cause. Her official website also displayed the campaign's official online banner.|$|E

2500|$|During the American Civil War Ordronaux {{served as}} an army surgeon {{stationed}} in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks {{on the health of}} armies, and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, [...] "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and <b>men</b> <b>need</b> an insight into the general principles of hygiene, {{in order to be able}} to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Northern Ireland 2010 Deputy Mayor of Newry and Mourne Council, Cllr Karen Mc Kevitt {{launched}} the Magnet Young Men's Health Event,' on Friday 19 November. The event {{was attended by}} men from across the district and representatives from local statutory, voluntary and community organisations were organised to celebrate 19 November as International Men's Day. Deputy Mayor, Cllr Mc Kevitt said, ‘It {{is a great idea}} to give an issue that has an international perspective a local focus. All <b>men</b> <b>need</b> to look after their health and take advantage of the services and help that is out there, as we all do. But it is particularly good to see an event that looks at the barriers that young men may be facing and brings together people from all organisations across the district to look at {{what can be done to}} work together to make things better.' The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today. Also in attendance was Jerome Burns, Assistant Director, Department for Social Development. Jerome stated, ‘The department for Social Development is delighted to support local initiatives that work with young men to highlight inequalities in health.' ...|$|E
