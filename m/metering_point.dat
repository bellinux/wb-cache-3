40|$|Lowering {{uncertainty}} in crude oil volume measurement {{has been widely}} considered as one of main purposes in an oil export terminal. It is found that crude oil temperature at metering station has big effects on measured volume and may cause big uncertainty at the <b>metering</b> <b>point.</b> As crude oil flows through an aboveground pipeline, pick up the solar radiation and heat up. This causes the oil temperature at the <b>metering</b> <b>point</b> to rise and higher uncertainty to be created. The amount of temperature rise is depended on exterior surface paint color.

40|$|Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) {{procedures}} {{have been shown}} to minimize the thrust required during landing, thereby reducing noise, emissions, and fuel usage for commercial aircraft. Thus, implementation of CDA at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest airport, would result in significant reductions in environmental impact and airline operating costs. The Air Transportation Laboratory at Georgia Tech, Delta Air Lines, and the local FAA facilities (Atlanta Center and Atlanta TRACON) collaborated to design CDA procedures for early morning arrivals from the west coast. Using the Tool for Analysis of Separation and Throughput (TASAT), we analyzed the performance of various aircraft types over a wide range of weights and wind conditions to determine the optimum descent profile parameters and to find the required spacing between aircraft types at a fixed <b>metering</b> <b>point</b> to implement the procedure. However, to see the full benefits of CDA, these spacing targets must be adhered, lest there will be a loss in capacity or negation of the noise, emissions, and fuel savings benefits. Thus a method was developed to determine adjustments to cruise speeds while aircraft are still en route, to achieve these spacing targets and to optimize fleet wide fuel burn increase. The tool in development, En route Speed Change Optimization Relay Tool (ESCORT), has been shown to solve the speed change problem quickly, incorporating aircraft fuel burn information and dividing the speed changes fairly across multiple airlines. The details of this tool will be explained in this thesis defense. Flight tests were conducted in April-May of 2007, where it was observed that the spacing targets developed by TASAT were accurate but that delivery of these aircraft to the <b>metering</b> <b>point</b> with the desired spacing targets was very challenging without automation. Thus, further flight tests will be conducted in 2008 using the en route spacing tool described above to validate the improvement it provides in terms of accurately delivering aircraft to the <b>metering</b> <b>point.</b> M.

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} a {{significant}} concern to communities near airports, and therefore a constraint {{to the growth of}} aviation. Advanced noise abatement approach and arrival procedures have been shown in previous studies and in limited implementation to be a cost effective means of achieving near- and medium-term noise reductions. Additionally, these procedures can be employed to reduce fuel bum, emissions, and flight time. However, because of aircraft trajectory variations due to operational uncertainties, it is difficult for air traffic controllers to predict and maintain separation between aircraft. Thus, without proper decision support tools, controllers need to add arbitrarily large buffers, thereby reducing airport throughput. A design and operational framework is proposed to advance the implementation of noise abatement arrival procedures. Under this framework, a target spacing is given at an intermediate <b>metering</b> <b>point</b> to ensure with a certain (limited) probability that the remainder of the noise abatement arrival procedure may be completed without further controller intervention. Small probability exceptions are handled by alternative plans. (cont.) A design methodology is presented, along with the details of a unique Monte Carlo simulation-based Tool for the Analysis of Separation And Throughput (TASAT) that is used to determine the minimum possible target spacing between aircraft at the <b>metering</b> <b>point.</b> Hence, a smaller separation buffer can be used and traffic throughput can be maintained at a relatively high level. The Monte Carlo simulation-based design tool accounts for operational uncertainties such as differences in aircraft performance, Flight Management System logic, aircraft weight, pilot response, and winds. A mode-decomposition and autoregressive approach was developed to model the stochastic wind variations between flights. Aircraft trajectories from the Monte Carlo simulations (or from radar tracks if they are available) are used {{within the context of the}} design methodology to determine target spacing for given desired probability. The utility of the design framework, methodology, and tools was illustrated through simulation analysis and an Area Navigation (RNAV) Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) flight test at Louisville International Airport. (cont.) The flight test results were consistent with the model prediction. The research demonstrated that with the developed tools, noise abatement arrival procedures can be implemented to achieve noise reductions and other economic and environmental benefits while maintaining a relatively high level of traffic throughput.

In this way, we propose a multivectorial relative quality index[*][*] associated with the power multivector. It can be assumed as a new index for power quality evaluation, harmonic sources detection, and power factor improvement in residential and commercial buildings.

40|$|Annual U. S. {{air travel}} demand {{has been growing}} {{steadily}} by 4 - 5 % over the last decade, and {{it is estimated that}} the demand will nearly double in the next twenty years. It has also been estimated by the International Civil Aviation Organization that global demand for commercial aircraft will increase at an average annual rate of 4. 1 % by 2034 (IATA, 2014). However, airport expansions and aviation infrastructure upgrades have not kept pace with the increase in air traffic demand, as only 3 % of all the new airport projects around the world are planned in the U. S. (CAPA, 2015). Thus, the operation rates at existing airports are likely to increase significantly, implying a greater need to increase the utilization of currently available runway capacity. With steadily increasing demand in air traffic and limited airport capacity, delay in air traffic is ubiquitous. Approximately 25 % of flights experience delays of at least 15 minutes each year, resulting in significant passenger service issues and costs to airlines and society in general. Delays constitute the top service complaint for airlines, which has implications for the society as a whole - both economically and environmentally. Flight delays also increase airline costs directly, due to associated additional fuel, crew and maintenance costs. Recent studies show that the estimated cost of air transportation delay to the American economy ranges from $ 32. 9 billion to $ 41 billion a year, of which, $ 8 billion are direct costs to airlines (Ball et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 2013). Noting that more than 60 % of delay is due to airport operations (Balakrishna et al., 2010), this thesis aims at helping reduce delay through better management of arrival and departure operations at airports, which can create relevant and significant value for the airlines and for the society. Arrival and departure operations inherently involve significant uncertainty. When an aircraft is approaching the runway, many factors affect its trajectory, such as weather, wind conditions, pilot behavior, aircraft weight, as well as the differences in types of aircraft and flight management systems. When an aircraft arrives at the gate, operating conditions, such as unplanned security checks, varied durations of deplaning and boarding, as well as the maintenance and fueling involved, could contribute to variations of actual departure time for the next flight. All of these stochastic factors involve uncertainty {{and they need to be}} taken into account while making operational decisions. On the other hand, stochastic treatment of such operational problems has not been common in the literature due to difficulties associated with the characterization of uncertainty and the computational tractability. I argue in this thesis that, with recent advances in computing power and data analysis tools, such stochastic treatments are more amenable for practical use. To this end, I study four novel operational problems related to flight arrivals and departures at airports under the uncertainty of operating conditions, and demonstrate the potential value that can be generated through stochastic models within the context of airline and airport operations. The problems I study involve both strategic and tactical decisions for airline service improvement and cost reduction. The first two problems consider managing arrival operations at airports, while the last two problems focus on departure operations. In the first and second problems, I focus on arrival operations in the context of optimized profile descent (OPD), which is a novel arrival procedure for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. In the first problem, I identify policies for managing arrival operations at the tactical level by developing a stochastic dynamic programming framework to manage the sequencing and separation of flights. I find that simple calculation based measures can be used as optimal decision rules during such operations, and that the expected annual savings can be around $ 29 million if such implementations are adapted by major airports in the U. S. Of these savings, $ 24 million are direct savings for airlines due to reduced fuel usage, corresponding to a potential savings of 10 - 15 % in fuel consumption over current practice. I also find that optimal spacing of OPD flights is much more important than optimal sequencing of these flights. Furthermore, there is not much difference between the environmental costs of fuel-optimal and sustainably-optimal spacing policies. Hence, an airline-centric approach in improving OPD operations is likely to be not in conflict with objectives that might be prioritized by other stakeholders. In the second problem, I study the optimal design of arrival traffic management systems at airports at the strategic level. I claim that implementation of OPD operations requires effective metering configurations at airports due to the increased role of uncertainty in aircraft trajectories during descent. I develop stochastic models to further increase the value of OPD operations over conventional arrival procedures by optimizing <b>metering</b> <b>point</b> configurations, which include identification of the optimal number and locations of metering points to use. I provide numerical results based on actual traffic information at major U. S. airports, which indicate that the total potential savings in the top ten major airports could be up to $ 22 million per year if the proposed policies are implemented. I also find that the optimal metering configurations are mostly robust under different operating conditions. In addition, my results suggest that early spacing adjustments near the top of descent (TOD) are of more value for larger volumes of air traffic. In the third and fourth problems, I study optimal departure operations at airports under the context of departure metering, which is an airport surface management procedure that limits the number of aircraft on the runway by holding aircraft at a predesigned metering area. More specifically, in the third problem, I develop a stochastic dynamic programming framework for tactical management of pushback operations at gates and for determining the optimal number of aircraft to be directed to the runway from the metering areas. I introduce four easy-to-implement practical departure metering policies and implement a comparative analysis between these practical policies and the optimal numerical solutions. I also implement sensitivity analysis of the departure metering policies over state variable values. In the fourth problem, I study the optimal metering area capacity at the strategic level. Building on the dynamic programming framework mentioned in the third problem, I identify the optimal metering area capacity using marginal analysis to minimize expected overall costs. Numerical simulations are implemented and potential savings are identified for sample U. S. airports based on varying capacity levels. The optimal metering area capacity is then determined based on the numerical implementations to further improve overall efficiency and sustainability of departure operations. I also analyze the benefits to airlines in terms of annual savings due to such policies, and find that the annual savings could be $ 31 million if the optimal departure metering policies are implemented at the top ten major airports in the U. S. Overall, as one of the few studies on stochasticity in arrival and departure operations, I derive both tactical and strategic policies to improve efficiency and sustainability for airlines and the society, which can enhance service quality and strengthen market position for the airlines involved...|$|E
