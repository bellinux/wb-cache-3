500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} at every {{show on the}} 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour. Concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that Bono performed as a variety of characters, but {{for the end of}} the main set, the group reverted to playing classics, including [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", straight. Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree photo shoot. The video was speeded up for humorous effect—NME described the effect as giving it a [...] "silly, Charlie Chaplin quality"—and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens. This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360° Tour. Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys' synthpop cover of the song (titled [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>off</b> You)"). Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys' interpretation. Critics welcomed the song in the group's set list: The Independent said the song [...] "induces instant euphoria, as U2 do what they're best at, slipping into epic rock mode, playing music made for the arena". In two other local newspaper reviews, critics praised the song's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits.|$|E

Canio to the tune of Ottawan's [...] "D.I.S.C.O.", or the chant of [...] "Who Let The Potts Out?" [...] to the tune of Baha Men's [...] "Who Let the Dogs Out?" [...] when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or [...] "That's Zamora" [...] to the tune of Dean Martin's 1953 [...] "That's Amore" [...] in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora. Other former players to be serenaded include Christian Dailly with vastly-altered lyrics to Frankie Valli's [...] "Can't Take <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>Off</b> You", Joe Cole and Carlton Cole with Spandau Ballet's [...] "Gold" [...] song title sung as [...] "Cole" [...] and Luděk Mikloško. A song for West Ham favourite Bobby Moore, [...] "Viva Bobby Moore", is also sung based on The Business's [...] "Oi!"

Has it made um too sick to eat a nice little Christian man for um's breakfast? Oh, a nice little Christian man will get um's thorn out for um; and then um shall eat the nice Christian man and the nice Christian man's nice big tender wifey pifey.

Now make velvet paws. That's right. (He pulls gingerly at the thorn. The lion, with an angry yell of pain, jerks back his paw so abruptly that Androcles is thrown on his back). Steadeee! Oh, did the nasty cruel little Christian man hurt the sore paw? (The lion moans assentingly but apologetically). Well, one more little pull {{and it will be}} all over. Just one little, little, leetle pull; and then um will live happily ever after. (He gives the thorn another pull. The lion roars and snaps his jaws with a terrifying clash). Oh, mustn't frighten um's good kind doctor, um's affectionate nursey. That didn't hurt at all: not a bit. Just one more.

Clever little liony-piony! Understands um's dear old friend Andy Wandy. (The lion licks his face). Yes, kissums Andy Wandy.
