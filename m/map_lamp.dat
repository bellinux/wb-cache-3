5000|$|As {{part of this}} update, officially {{known as}} the TJ MY02 series, side impact bars {{previously}} fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front <b>map</b> <b>lamps,</b> glovebox lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi's electric sunroof with front <b>map</b> <b>lamps</b> and C pillar courtesy lamps was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non [...] "high output") 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to [...] thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter. The instrument cluster now had an integrated odometer and trip meter, {{as opposed to the}} previous analogue setup. The above engine power increase also interested the Verada range. Moreover, the Ei was now fitted with a new chrome grille, while both the Ei and Xi received new design alloy-wheels and illuminated vanity mirrors.

40|$|The {{availability}} of T 5 high-efficiency (HE) and high-output (HO) fluorescent lamp families not only increases {{the number of}} commonly used tubular fluorescent lamps from 9 to 18, but more importantly, increases the chance of ballast-lamp mismatch because T 5 (HO) and T 5 (HE) lamps have similar physical outlooks and dimensions but vastly different lamp characteristics. The large number of lamp types increases the number of specific ballast designs and users have the new inconvenience of ensuring the correct matching of the lamps and ballasts. In this paper, a survey and analysis of lamp characteristics of all commonly used T 5, T 8 and T 12 tubular fluorescent lamps is presented. Based on the heated lamp electrodes, lamp voltage and lamp current, a classification system that <b>maps</b> the <b>lamp</b> characteristics into various groups for automatic lamp detection is proposed.

40|$|In 2009, the Lyman Alpha <b>Mapping</b> Project (<b>LAMP)</b> {{spectrograph}} onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft {{made the}} first detection of element mercury (Hg) vapor in the lunar exosphere after the Lunar Crater Observing and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) Centaur rocket impacted into the Cabeus crater in the southern polar region of the Moon. The lunar regolith core samples from the Apollo missions determined that Hg had a devolatilized pattern with a concentration gradient increasing with depth, {{in addition to a}} layered pattern suggesting multiple episodes of burial and volatile loss. Hg migration on the lunar surface resulted in cold trapping at the poles. We have modeled the rate at which indigenous Hg is lost from the regolith through diffusion out of lunar grains. We secondly modeled the migration of Hg vapor in the exosphere and estimated the rate of cold-trapping at the poles using a Monte Carlo technique. The Hg vapor may be lost from the exosphere via ionization, Jeans escape, or re-impact into the surface causing reabsorption...|$|R
50|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is {{the first}} mission of the LPRP program. Management of LRO was {{assigned}} to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in 2004. LRO launched on an Atlas V 401 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on June 18, 2009 at 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT). The planned lift off for 5:12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT) was slightly delayed by 20 minutes due to thunderstorms. It will orbit the Moon for one year, gathering high resolution images of the lunar surface {{that will allow the}} creation of detailed maps. LRO's goals include finding safe landing sites for human visits to the Moon, identifying lunar resources, and studying the lunar radiation environment. The LRO will provide a 3-D map of the Moon's surface to allow astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020. On board the LRO are seven instruments, the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), Lyman-Alpha <b>Mapping</b> Project (<b>LAMP),</b> Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND), Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), and Miniature Radio Frequency radar (Mini-RF).|$|R
30|$|There {{have been}} several efforts towards {{modelling}} of the lunar exosphere which were later compared with measurements made by LRO and LADEE. Sarantos et al. (2012), also modelled the column abundances of expected lunar exospheric constituents and found that except for Ca, the modelled abundances matches with the available measurements. This suggested the role of loss processes such as gas-to-solid phase condensation during micrometeoroid impacts or the formation of stable metallic oxides, which {{were not included in}} the model. In addition, Sarantos et al. (2012) have compared the estimates of the ion flux of the expected lunar exospheric constituents with the estimates for the ion fluxes ejected from the lunar surface by solar wind ions and electrons. This showed that measurements of ions around Moon will help to understand the abundances of many undetected species in the lunar exosphere because the expected ion flux levels from the exosphere exceed those from the surface. The observations of He in the lunar exosphere using the Lyman Alpha <b>Mapping</b> Project (<b>LAMP)</b> ultraviolet spectrograph on LRO showed day-to-day variations in the derived surface He density which correspond to the variations in the solar wind He^++ flux (Feldman etÂ al. 2012). In addition, there was a reduction by a factor of two in the surface He density when the Moon passes through Earthâs magnetotail, which was explained by models.|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{measurements}} of helium in the exosphere of the Moon {{are made from}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lyman Alpha <b>Mapping</b> Project (<b>LAMP)</b> and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) through the entire 5 -month span of the LADEE mission. In addition, the ARTEMIS mission monitored the solar wind alpha particle flux to the Moon. Modeling the lunar helium exosphere, we relate the LAMP polar observations to the LADEE equatorial observations. Further, using the ARTEMIS alpha flux in the Monte Carlo model reproduces the temporal variations in helium density. Comparing the LAMP data to the LADEE data shows excellent agreement. Comparing those with the ARTEMIS data reveals that the solar wind alpha flux is the primary driver to variability in the helium exosphere throughout the LADEE mission. Using a decay time for exospheric helium of 5 days, we determine that the solar wind contributes 64 +/- 5 % of the helium to the lunar exosphere. The remaining 36 +/- 5 % is presumed to come from outgassing of radiogenic helium from {{the interior of the}} Moon. Furthermore, the model reproduces the measurements if 63 +/- 6 % of the incident alpha particles are converted to thermalized helium atoms through the interaction between the alphas and the lunar surface. However, these values are dependent on both inferred source rates from LAMP and LADEE observations and on the assumed time constant of the exospheric decay rate...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{entry of}} many enveloped viruses occurs by {{engagement}} with cellular receptors, followed by internalization into endocytic compartments and pH-induced membrane fusion. A previously unnoticed step of receptor switching {{was found to}} be critical during cell entry of two devastating human pathogens: Ebola and Lassa viruses. Our recent studies revealed the functional role of receptor switching to LAMP 1 for triggering membrane fusion by Lassa virus and showed the involvement of conserved histidines in this switching, suggesting that other viruses from this family may also switch to LAMP 1. However, when we investigated viruses that are genetically close to Lassa virus, we discovered that they cannot bind LAMP 1. A crystal structure of the receptor-binding module from Morogoro virus revealed structural differences that allowed <b>mapping</b> of the <b>LAMP</b> 1 binding site to a unique set of Lassa residues not shared by other viruses in its family, illustrating a key difference in the cell-entry mechanism of Lassa virus that may contribute to its pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) was {{implemented}} to facilitate scientific and engineering-driven mapping {{of the lunar}} surface at new spatial scales and with new remote sensing methods, identify safe landing sites, search for in situ resources, and measure the space radiation environment. After its successful launch on June 18, 2009, the LRO spacecraft and instruments were activated and calibrated in an eccentric polar lunar orbit until September 15, when LRO was moved to a circular polar orbit with a mean altitude of 50 km. LRO will operate {{for at least one}} year to support the goals of NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), and {{for at least two years}} of extended operations for additional lunar science measurements supported by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD).

40|$|Moon is {{extremely}} tenuous, {{with a total}} mass of only ~ 10 4 kg (i. e., at STP it would fit inside a large building) [1]. Since it is so thin, the lunar atmosphere is difficult to detect, and has only been partially sampled in situ on the nightside by Apollo pressure gauges & mass spectrometers (these were swamped by contamination on the dayside) [2]. Likewise, remote sensing is only possible using the brightest of atomic resonance lines (e. g., from Na, see Fig. 1) [3, 4]. The observed composition of the lunar atmosphere is dominated by noble gases (Ar, He) with a minor (~ 1 %) contribution from alkali species (Na, K); Species expected but not yet observed include CO, H 2 O, O, H 2, and S. Despite being hard to measure, the Moonâs atmosphere can provide useful constraints on volatile sources (e. g., outgassing, meteroroid & comet impact, solar wind), sinks (e. g., sputtering, photoionization & solar wind pickup, surface adsorption condensation), and transport (ballistic, surface diffusion, implantation of pickup ions).

40|$|International audienceArgon {{is one of}} the few known {{constituents}} of the lunar exosphere. The surface-based mass spectrometer Lunar Atmosphere Composition Experiment (LACE) deployed during the Apollo 17 mission first detected argon, and its study is among the subjects of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lyman Alpha <b>Mapping</b> Project (<b>LAMP)</b> and Lunar Atmospheric and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission investigations. We performed a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of neutral atomic argon that we use to better understand its transport and storage across the lunar surface. We took into account several loss processes: ionization by solar photons, charge-exchange with solar protons, and cold trapping as computed by recent LRO/Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) mapping of Permanently Shaded Regions (PSRs). Recycling of photo-ions and solar radiation acceleration are also considered. We report that (i) contrary to previous assumptions, charge exchange is a loss process as efficient as photo-ionization, (ii) the PSR cold-trapping flux is comparable to the ionization flux (photo-ionization and charge-exchange), and (iii) solar radiation pressure has negligible effect on the argon density, as expected. We determine that the release of 2. 6 Ã 10 28 atoms on top of a pre-existing argon exosphere is required to explain the maximum amount of argon measured by LACE. The total number of atoms (1. 0 Ã 10 29) corresponds to â¼ 6700 kg of argon, 30 % of which (â¼ 1900 kg) may be stored in the cold traps after 120 days in the absence of space weathering processes. The required population is consistent with the amount of argon that can be released during a High Frequency Teleseismic (HFT) Event, i. e. a big, rare and localized moonquake, although we show that LACE could not distinguish between a localized and a global event. The density of argon measured at the time of LACE appears to have originated from no less than four such episodic events. Finally, we show that the extent of the PSRs that trap argon, 0. 007 % of the total lunar surface, is consistent with the presence of adsorbed water in such PSRs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} cavers in Europe and North America {{were limited}} in their explorations {{by a lack of}} suitable equipment. Explorers of the early 1800s, when caving began to become more common, caved in tweed suits and used candles for illumination. Exploration was usually limited to drier caves as there was little to protect cavers from the cold once they became wet. Later, cavers began to adopt miners lamps, which were designed for underground use and were reasonably reliable, though their light was not especially powerful. Lighting magnesium strips was a popular way of illuminating large chambers. E.A. Martel, a French caver, created a collapsible canvas canoe which he used to explore several caves containing long flooded sections, such as the Marble Arch Cave in Northern Ireland. His expeditionary equipment was describe in 1895 as: [...] "a canvas boat, some hundreds of feet of rope - ladders, a light portable folding wooden ladder, ropes, axes, compass, barometer, telephone, <b>map</b> etc.'". Acetylene <b>lamps,</b> powered by carbide, {{was one of the main}} light sources used by cavers during the 20th century.

40|$|The {{effects of}} climate change have been {{detected}} in various natural systems in the last century (IPCC, 2014). As a consequence of these changes, governments are seeking to identify adaptive strategies for protecting citizens and vulnerable economic sectors (Adger et al., 2005; Smit & Wandel, 2006). Coastal areas are particularly susceptible to a changing climate as sea level continues to rise and storm surges become more powerful and frequent events. This research introduces the use of the participatory Geoweb as a tool (labelled âAdaptNSâ) for supporting local climate change adaptation efforts in Shelburne County, Nova Scotia. AdaptNS serves as a visualization tool for displaying high-resolution interactive flood maps of sea level rise and storm surge scenarios between 2000 and 2100. The participatory aspect of this Geoweb tool is integrated as a means for decision-makers, stakeholders, and community members to identify adaptation priorities in response to climate change risks. This interdisciplinary approach was possible through the use of several technologies, including the Arcpy Python library for analysis, and a coupling of the Google <b>Maps</b> API and <b>LAMP</b> bundle for the front-end and back-end tool development. By using feedback from community members, AdaptNS was identified to support local adaptation by providing communities with comprehensive visuals of climate change risks, a platform for identifying adaptation priorities, and a means to communicate local risks to upper levels of government and businesses...|$|R

40|$|Random {{mutagenesis}} {{followed by}} phenotypic selection (forward genetics) {{is among the}} most powerful tools to elucidate the molecular basis of intricate biological processes and has been used in a suite of model organisms throughout the last century. However, its application to cultured mammalian cells is complicated by their diploid nature, as for most genes this creates a genetic buffer preventing the occurrence of a loss-of-function phenotype. Here, we highlight the potential of haploid human somatic cells for random mutagenesis-based genetic screens. First, using the hemorrhagic fever agent Lassa virus and specific antibodies, we profile genes needed for the functional glycosylation of the Lassa virus receptor, dystroglycan, in a genome-wide screen. This reveals all previously known genes needed for dystroglycan modification and implicates five new factors in the process. Surprisingly, these include the putative kinase SGK 196 /POMK â unusual for the generation of glycan structures. Using nuclease-generated knockout cell lines and genetic complementation, we confirm the function of these genes in dystroglycan glycosylation and Lassa virus entry and describe loss-of-function mutations for SKG 196 and TMEM 5 in patients suffering from hereditary dystroglycanopathy of unknown cause, underscoring the relevance of our observations for human disease. In-depth analysis of Lassa virus entry with iterative haploid genetic screens reveals a role for the intracellular factor lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1) in Lassa virus entry that is independent of dystroglycan. We expose an interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein with human LAMP 1 that is regulated by pH and not shared by avian LAMP 1 â rationalizing the 30 -year-old observation that bird cells resist infection. Additional haploid genetic screens point out a specific requirement of Lassa virus for Î± 2, 3 -linked sialic acid, which we <b>map</b> to <b>LAMP</b> 1. Serial ablation of LAMP 1 glycosylation sites reveals a critical function of glycosylated Asn 76 for glycoprotein binding and infection. Remarkably, this site is absent in avian LAMP 1, explaining its inability to accommodate virus entry. Finally, we confirm the importance of LAMP 1 for Lassa virus infection in vivo using knockout mice. Our findings suggest an unusual entry mechanism for Lassa virus that involves a pH-induced receptor switch from dystroglycan to LAMP 1 as the virus traverses the endocytic compartment. Last, we describe how haploid genetics can be used to identify human genes needed for fitness and expose genetic interactions. By mapping tens of millions of independent gene-trap integrations, we assign a fitness score to virtually every expressed gene. This reveals approximately 2, 000 genes needed for cellular fitness in KBM 7 and HAP 1 cells. With this information we investigate the purpose of essential âorphan genesâ. This reveals a role for C 11 orf 10 in the functionally conserved oligosaccharyltransferase complex needed for N-glycosylation. Using depletion screens in isogenic knockout cells, we assemble a genetic interaction map of the secretory pathway that exposes a role for PTAR 1 and C 10 orf 76 in this cellular process. Our data demonstrate the existence of numerous synthetic lethal interactions between human genes and their high degree of compartmentalization. This parallels observations in yeast and encourages a systematic search for synthetic lethal interactions in genes frequently mutated in human malignancies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Iâve {{been working}} for years on artistic {{installations}} in which appear light sources or light effects directly produced by these sources. After the first three books devoted to Light Art in Italy, where were introduced more than 150 installations of light produced in my country, in 2012 I decided to research and document the experimental work carried out {{in every part of}} the world. This decision is based on two considerations: the Italian market is very limited and therefore you are likely to repeat always the same authors; experimentation carried out with the artistic use of light sources and their effects is held by a multiplicity of actors ranging from engineers to performers, directors for artists, hobbyists, lighting designer. For this reason, last year I published the book Light Works, Experimen- tal light art, in which the term âexperimental â was just to indicate one of the fundamental characteristics of artistic research carried out in the field. For the book of this year I wanted to continue the search for new ways to experience the light and that is why I have chosen to focus my work on what is called â Projection Mapping â in the U. S., âVideo Mappingâ outside the USA and simply âmappingâ in Italy. All of these terms define a technique that consists in projecting images or two-dimensional or three-dimensional graphical effects on a surface which can be as well two-dimensional or three-dimensional. The mapping is increasingly being used in Italy in advertising and in the performances on the square and at weekends. Many times, however, the projections of images on the buildings do not find any topological correspondence with the buildings that are used as simple screens, this technique is improperly called Mapping and has little interest in documentary. Mapping the other hand, as the name implies, involves the mapping of the object on which the projections are made and it is required to detect on it a grid of points or positions used to overwrite the images and the projected effects. But the mapping is not limited only to the projection of images and effects on buildings, but it has chosen from the beginning, a variety of subjects on which and with which conduct the first trials, which, accor- ding to research conducted by Brett Jones in his The illustrated Hystory op Projection Mapping are summarized below. The first projections on non-planar surfaces were done in 1969 and used in Disneyland to give terrifying effect to 5 plaster busts called âGrim Grinning Ghostâ and it was the super - screening of a 16 mm film. The first experience of immersive projection mapping was done in 1980 by the artist Michael Naimark, that films a camera with a rotating camera on which reprojects some human figures, and in 1994 he patented an apparatus described as âApparatus and method for projecting on a three-dimensional objectâ. In 1998 Ramesh Raskar, Greg Welch, Henry Fuchs and Deepak Bandyopadhyay and others submit to the 25 th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques. ACM, 1998. âThe Office of the Futureâ with Spatial Augmented Reality devices, such as it was then called the Mapping. In 2001, the group of researchers who follow Raskar introduced what we might call today <b>Mapping,</b> with a <b>lamp</b> - brush that, recognized by a camera, paints colorful lights on a tray. Later the same group used the mapping to change appearance to a model of the Taj Mahal. In 2004, the same researchers use mapping equipment to make the inventory of the goods in a warehouse. Between 2005 and 2006, Oliver Bimber changes the texture with projection mappings in the drapes, creates stamping of a painting and a drawing {{and for the first time}} he projects mapping on architecture. Since then, experiments have increased dramatically, and there are currently many Video Mapping festivals such as the Mapping Festival in Geneva, the Fiber Festival in Amsterdam, the Festival of Light in Berlin, the Vivid Live in Sydney. The book Light Works, Experimental Video Mapping 2013 shows 50 works chosen with the help of Cristina Di Pasquali among the most representative performed in the world. Each job is represented by an image and accompanied by the de- scription of the work, the biography of the author and reference links. In addition, each work has an QR code so that through the book, with a tablet or smart phone you can immediately enjoy the moving images, that best illustrate and represent the magic of Mapping more tha...|$|R
