50|$|An early {{witness of}} the {{phenomenon}} was Ralph Bray, a young graduate student. He joined the germanium effort at Purdue University in November 1943 and was given the tricky task of measuring the spreading resistance at the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>contact.</b> Bray found a great many anomalies, such as internal high-resistivity barriers in some samples of germanium. The most curious phenomenon was the exceptionally low resistance observed when voltage pulses were applied. This effect remained a mystery because nobody realised, until 1948, that Bray had observed minority carrier injection - the effect that was identified by William Shockley at Bell Labs and made the transistor a reality.|$|E

40|$|<b>Metal-semiconductor</b> <b>contacts</b> play a {{key role}} in electronics. Here we show that for quasi-one {{dimensional}} (Q 1 D) structures such as nanotubes and nanowires, side contact with the metal only leads to weak band realignment, in contrast with bulk <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>contacts.</b> Schottky barriers are much reduced compared with the bulk limit, and should facilitate the formation of good contacts. However, the conventional strategy of heavily doping the semiconductor to obtain Ohmic contacts breaks down as the nanowire diameter is reduced. The issue of Fermi level pinning is also discussed, and it is demonstrated that the unique density of states of Q 1 D structures makes them less sensitive to this effect. Our results agree with recent experimental work, and should apply to a broad range of Q 1 D materials. Comment: Physical Review Letters 97, 026804 (2006...|$|R
