50|$|It is {{increasingly}} common practice {{around the world}} to regulate the storage water temperature to above 60 °C (140 °F), and to circulate or distribute water at a temperature less than 50 °C (122 °F). Water above these temperatures can cause scald injuries. Many countries, states, or municipalities now require that the temperature of all bath water in newly built and extensively refurbished domestic properties be controlled to a maximum of 48 °C (118 °F). Installing thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> can ensure that water is delivered at the required temperature, thereby reducing the risk of scalding accidents; it also reduces hot water consumption from a supply that is maintained at a higher temperature.|$|E

5000|$|The new yellow-brick {{building}} with slate roofs echoed the construction materials used by its larger neighbour, the Cambridge Military Hospital. It cost £12,600 {{to build and}} had [...] "sanitary blocks" [...] incorporated in [...] "Italianate" [...] corner towers towards the back. There were fifty-three beds arranged in eleven wards of different sizes, including wards named for Queen Victoria, the Duke of Connaught and Lord Lansdowne. The staircases had shallow steps, supposed to help nurses in long dresses run up and down. A [...] "fine" [...] tiled operating theatre was added in 1908 and officially opened by the Duchess in 1909. It had a new sort of [...] "brilliant light" [...] and Doulton basins and sinks [...] "fitted with the latest kind of <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> for hot and cold water with elbow-action and sprays". Within {{a couple of years}} the hospital was treating around 1000 cases annually: about half in its General Division and half in its Maternity Division which had twenty-five [...] "swing cots" [...] along with twenty-five beds.|$|E
50|$|Water for baths, {{sinks and}} basins can be {{provided}} by separate hot and cold taps; this arrangement is common in older installations, particularly in public washrooms/lavatories and utility rooms/laundries. In kitchens and bathrooms, mixer taps are commonly used. In this case, hot and cold water from the two valves is mixed before reaching the outlet, allowing the water to emerge at any temperature between that of the hot and cold water supplies. Mixer taps were invented by Thomas Campbell of Saint John, New Brunswick, and patented in 1880.For baths and showers, mixer taps frequently incorporate some sort of pressure balancing feature so that the hot/cold mixture ratio will not be affected by transient changes in the pressure of one or other of the supplies. This helps avoid scalding or uncomfortable chilling as other water loads occur (such as the flushing of a toilet).Rather than two separate valves, mixer taps frequently use a single, more complex, valve controlled by a single handle (single handle mixer). The handle moves up and down to control {{the amount of water}} flow and from side to side to control the temperature of the water. Especially for baths and showers, the latest designs are thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> that do this using a built-in thermostat, and can be mechanical or electronic. There are also faucets with color LEDs to show the temperature of the water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{model of}} a {{thermostat}} used in thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> (TMVs) has been developed. The model contains realistic boundary conditions and material properties including the latent heat corresponding to a mixture of waxes inside the thermostat. The temperature-time characteristics show a relatively slow heating of the thermo-stat regardless of the flow rate. This implies an improvement potential for the thermostat and thus the entire valve...|$|E
50|$|In smaller footprints, {{temperature}} chaining can {{be achieved}} by creating a small water circuit with a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> and buffer tank. This allows the output of the liquid installation to be routed back to the cooling input to gradually increase the cooling circuit and achieve a constant high output temperature. Although this is not the multi-stage approach, it is a common and well proven practice for achieving constant input or output temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Many {{physiological}} experiments involve switching {{between two}} or more solutions. For example, when drugs are applied to tissues the concentration of the drug is usually changed as a step function, by switching from a control saline to a saline containing the drug. There are many instances {{where it would be}} advantageous to change the concentration according to some other function such as a ramp. This paper describes how this has been achieved by a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> under electronic control. The <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> (incorporating a Lee Products, solenoid valve No LFAX 050303 AC) was arranged to control the mixing of two solutions and thus vary the composition of the effluent stream. The composition of the solution leaving the output is directly proportional to the time that the valve allows each of the inputs to be connected to the output (Cook & Hokanson, 1976). The electronic circuit for control of the valve is shown in Fig. 1. Driving current for the valve is provided by TRX under control of a pulse width modulator, ICi Fig. 1 (A). Permanently connected to the non-inverting input of ICi is a triangula...|$|R

Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting scald injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. ResultsFourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of scalds in children.
