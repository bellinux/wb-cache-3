25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or <b>mini-stroke.</b> A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was {{admitted}} to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a <b>mini-stroke.</b> Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still have people who like to watch it." ...|$|E

50|$|Stuss, et al. {{discuss in}} a review of many studies how damage to the frontal lobe can occur in an {{assortment}} of ways and result in many different consequences. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) also known as <b>mini-strokes,</b> and strokes are common causes of frontal lobe damage in older adults (65 and over). These strokes and <b>mini-strokes</b> can occur due to the blockage of blood flow to the brain or {{as a result of the}} rupturing of an aneurysm in a cerebral artery. Other ways in which injury can occur include head injuries such as traumatic brain injuries incurred following accidents, diagnoses such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease (which cause dementia symptoms), and frontal lobe epilepsy (which can occur at any age).|$|R
50|$|On 19 November 2015, Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) {{was at a}} doctor's {{appointment}} {{where he}} was diagnosed with early onset vascular dementia. Ashley marries Laurel Dingle (Charlotte Bellamy) on 18 March 2016, and his illness begins to show. He also experiences <b>mini-strokes,</b> which affects his brain and he loses more memory.|$|R
500|$|As {{of season}} 25, 286 celebrities have competed. Seven of those {{withdrew from the}} competition: Sara Evans of season three left the show to [...] "give her family full attention" [...] after filing for divorce; Misty May-Treanor of season seven was forced to pull out after an ankle injury; Tom DeLay of season nine {{reportedly}} withdrew [...] "due to stress fractures in both of his feet"; Dorothy Hamill of season sixteen withdrew due to a previous injury that was unrelated to the competition; Billy Dee Williams of season eighteen quit due to a back injury; Kim Zolciak-Biermann of season twenty-one was forced to withdraw after suffering a <b>mini-stroke,</b> which prevented her from flying to California; and Tamar Braxton of season twenty-one withdrew due to pulmonary embolisms in her lungs. At age 14, actress Willow Shields of season twenty was the youngest contestant to compete on the show. At age 82, actress Cloris Leachman of season seven was the oldest contestant to compete on the show. At age 51, singer Donny Osmond of season nine was the oldest contestant to win the competition. At age 16 years, Laurie Hernandez of season twenty-three was the youngest contestant to win. The first (and, as of now, only) contestant to pass away after appearing on the show is Florence Henderson of season eleven, who died in November 2016, six years after her participation. Forty-four [...] professional dancers have partnered with the celebrities. The twenty-four winners of the show, in chronological order, are Kelly Monaco, Drew Lachey, Emmitt Smith, Apolo Anton Ohno, Hélio Castroneves, Kristi Yamaguchi, Brooke Burke, Shawn Johnson, Donny Osmond, Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Grey, Hines Ward, J.R. Martinez, Donald Driver, Melissa Rycroft, Kellie Pickler, Amber Riley, Meryl Davis, Alfonso Ribeiro, Rumer Willis, Bindi Irwin, Nyle DiMarco, Laurie Hernandez and Rashad Jennings.

50|$|In January and August 2008, Payne went {{on medical}} leave after {{suffering}} {{from a series of}} <b>mini-strokes.</b> In November 2008 WGN-TV announced that Payne would take an indefinite leave of absence because of ongoing health issues. Payne admitted in an interview with Chicago Tribune media columnist Phil Rosenthal that she sought treatment for depression during her absence months earlier.|$|R
50|$|In January 2013, The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a report from}} a National Enquirer interview with Richardson. She reported she had experienced extremely hard times, living in an unheated trailer with a rotting floor in Wagontown, Pennsylvania, not far from her hometown of Coatesville. Richardson said she had developed diabetes, suffered three <b>mini-strokes,</b> had lost 60 lb, and lost her teeth {{as the result of}} a digestive condition.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, while {{delivering}} a eulogy {{at the funeral}} of Rabbi Yaakov Mutzafi, he suddenly felt ill and suffered a stroke a short while later. Half his body was paralyzed and his speech was slurred. Over the next 15 years, he suffered a series of <b>mini-strokes</b> that eventually made him a wheelchair user. Nevertheless, he continued to teach Torah and to involve himself in community affairs.|$|R

Later in 2010, he fell victim to a massive stroke and was moved to a long-term care facility in Gresham. Due to the stroke, Johnson lost the ability to sit up unassisted and could no longer use his right hand. He also lost sight in his left eye and further lost the ability to speak above a whisper. He also suffered great pain when swallowing, which made feeding him difficult.|$|R
50|$|A {{cerebrovascular}} {{disease is a}} vascular disease of the cerebral circulation.

40|$|Most {{processing}} of sensation involves the cortical hemisphere opposite (contralateral) to the stimulated limb. Stroke patients can exhibit {{changes in the}} interhemispheric balance of sensory signal processing. It is unclear whether these changes {{are the result of}} poststroke rewiring and experience, or whether they could result from the immediate effect of circuit loss. We evaluated the effect of <b>mini-strokes</b> over short timescales (< 2 h) where cortical rewiring is unlikely by monitoring sensory-evoked activity throughout much of both cortical hemispheres using voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Blockade of a single pial arteriole within the C 57 BL 6 J mouse forelimb somatosensory cortex reduced the response evoked by stimulation of the limb contralateral to the stroke. However, after stroke, the ipsilateral (uncrossed) forelimb response within the unaffected hemisphere was spared and became independent of the contralateral forelimb cortex. Within the unaffected hemisphere, <b>mini-strokes</b> in the opposite hemisphere significantly enhanced sensory responses produced by stimulation of either contralateral or ipsilateral pathways within 30 – 50 min of stroke onset. Stroke-induced enhancement of responses within the spared hemisphere was not reproduced by inhibition of either cortex or thalamus using pharmacological agents in nonischemic animals. I/LnJ acallosal mice showed similar rapid interhemispheric redistribution of sensory processing after stroke, suggesting that subcortical connections and not transcallosal projections were mediating the novel activation patterns. Thalamic inactivation before stroke prevented the bilateral rearrangement of sensory responses. These findings suggest that acute stroke, and not merely loss of activity, activates unique pathways that can rapidly redistribute function within the spared cortical hemisphere...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Prather {{moved to the}} [...] "Adobe Acre," [...] the Prathers' {{sprawling}} family home in Taos, New Mexico. After his mother's death in 1976, Prather defied her will and sold the home, using the money to finance a move to Basel, Switzerland. It was during this time that Prather began to suffer from <b>mini-strokes</b> that caused intense breaks with reality and interfered with his ability to work. Some believe that Prather’s health issues {{may have been the}} result of toxic exposure to the selenium that he used to tone his prints. Prather achieved moderate success as a fine art photographer in Europe; his work was acquired by several collectors there. Yet, he had difficulty getting commercial work. Dwindling finances forced Prather to return to Denver the following year.|$|R
50|$|Brain {{ischemia}} {{is insufficient}} {{blood flow to}} the brain, and can be acute or chronic. Acute ischemic stroke is a neurologic emergency that may be reversible if treated rapidly. Chronic ischemia of the brain may result in a form of dementia called vascular dementia. A brief episode of ischemia affecting the brain is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA) often called a <b>mini-stroke.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transient ischemic attack (TIA) {{also called}} a <b>mini-stroke.</b> This is a {{condition}} in which the blood flow is quickly restored and the brain tissue can fully recover and the symptoms are only transient, leaving no sequelae. In order to diagnose this entity all neurologic signs and symptoms must have been resolved within 24 hrs without evidence of brain infarction on brain imaging.|$|E
50|$|After {{suffering}} a <b>mini-stroke,</b> Kim Zolciak-Biermann {{was able to}} rehearse, but her doctors refused to clear her for air travel. As a result, {{she was unable to}} attend the dress rehearsal and the live show, which, according to the show's rules, meant she would have to withdraw from the competition. Had she not withdrawn from the competition, either Andy & Allison or Paula & Louis would have been eliminated that night. Her dance partner, Tony Dovolani, performed their routine during the live show with stand-in Jenna Johnson. There was no additional elimination.|$|E
50|$|Beth {{returns to}} Los Angeles in 2008 {{at the request}} of Nick Marone (Jack Wagner), because he thinks her {{youngest}} daughter, Katie, who recently had a heart transplant, needs her. Her family becomes worried about Beth's strange behaviour. Beth eventually reveals to Katie that she has had several <b>mini-strokes</b> and is also {{in the early stages of}} dementia. It takes some convincing from her family, but Beth finally agrees to stay in Los Angeles and receive treatment from her granddaughter Dr. Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) and Dr. Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). The treatment appears to be working. Stephen and Beth have also hinted at a possible reconciliation. After a long absence Stephen and Beth reappeared for Nick and Bridget's wedding and it was mentioned that they had been in Paris. Beth dies in the Forrester Pool after a fight between her and Stephanie in 2010, devastating the Logans.|$|R
50|$|Carter began {{experiencing}} T.I.A.s (transient ischemic attacks, or <b>mini-strokes)</b> at age 87 in 1992, but recovered {{sufficiently to}} continue performing. His last major performances were {{a pair of}} concerts {{on the occasion of}} his 90th birthday, at the Avalon Theater on Santa Catalina Island and the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California. After living in Hollywood for thirty years, he spent his final years in his home in the Los Angeles district of San Pedro, where he had resided since 1968 in a house designed by architect Richard Neutra. In 1996, he suffered a massive stroke at age 91, from which he recovered mentally but not physically. For the next four years he held court in San Pedro, unable to play but ever the witty survivor still receiving his many friends and admirers-who basked warmly in his company. After a second stroke in 2000, Gaylord Carter died peacefully in his home overlooking the Pacific ocean at the age of 95.|$|R
50|$|Patrick {{suffers a}} number of <b>mini-strokes,</b> but recovers quickly and decides against visiting a doctor. He finds out that Ian had sex with prostitute Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), so threatens Ian that he will tell Denise. After seeing Ian and Denise leaving, Patrick leaves Denise an urgent {{voicemail}} and then suffers a major stroke {{in the middle of}} the street and is hospitalised. Patrick loses the ability to speak and is very confused. Anthony returns to Walford to visit Patrick, but Patrick mistakes Anthony for his deceased stepson, Paul. Anthony reveals to Denise that he cannot look after Patrick, so gives Denise £2000 to look after him. Despite Ian's attempts to ensure the safety of his secret by putting Patrick in a care home, he eventually agrees to let Patrick live with him and Denise. However, Rainie reveals the truth to Denise. She tells Ian she forgives him, but when she discovers that Patrick knew but could not tell her because of his stroke, she decides to leave Ian. They then find Patrick's house broken into and trashed.|$|R

50|$|Zimmer {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey on April 11, 2008, after being drafted by New Jersey Republican leaders. Party leaders had originally supported businesswoman Anne Evans Estabrook for the Senate nomination until she withdrew in March 2008, following a <b>mini-stroke.</b> Many Estabrook supporters then supported businessman Andy Unanue for the Senate nomination. Unanue received criticism in the race because of his residency in New York City and his spending his entire three-week campaign in Vail, Colorado. Several days after filing his petitions for the Senate race, Unanue dropped out of the race and his committee on vacancies designated Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Unanue {{was briefly}} a Republican primary {{candidate}} to face incumbent Frank Lautenberg in that year's U.S. Senate election. After {{the withdrawal of}} moderate Republican Anne Evans Estabrook, who was initially the New Jersey GOP establishment's choice, due to a <b>mini-stroke,</b> Unanue announced his candidacy {{in a letter to}} the party chairman on Easter Sunday, March 23, 2008, while on holiday in Vail, Colorado. He was reportedly considering dropping out of the Senate race to make way for Princeton biotechnology executive John Crowley, but after Crowley signaled that he would not run, Unanue announced that he had filed petitions for the race on April 7, 2008. However, on April 11, Unanue dropped out of the race, and his committee on vacancies designated former Congressman Dick Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions.|$|E
50|$|Danny Rayburn {{returns home}} to Islamorada, Florida for the 45th {{anniversary of his}} parents' Robert and Sally Rayburn's seaside hotel, The Rayburn House - a pier will be {{dedicated}} in their honor to mark the occasion. Danny is the black sheep of the family, with a poor reputation amongst them, including his three younger siblings: John, Kevin, and Meg. John is a detective with the local sheriff's office, Kevin owns a local marina, and Meg is an attorney with a local law firm. Danny wants to make his return permanent as he wishes to stay to help his parents at their Inn. Robert is reluctant to let Danny stay, but leaves {{it up to the}} three siblings to decide Danny's fate. The siblings decide against Danny staying as they conclude that he will only break Sally's heart in the end. John breaks the news to Danny, but lies to him by telling him it was their father who wanted him gone, rather than the siblings. Ultimately Danny does not leave, despite allowing John to take him back to the bus stop. Danny's dysfunctional relationship with his father inadvertently causes Robert to have <b>mini-strokes</b> and eventually leads to his death.|$|R
50|$|A {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA) is {{a transient}} episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by ischemia (loss of blood flow) - either focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal - without acute infarction (tissue death). TIAs {{have the same}} underlying cause as strokes: a disruption of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and are {{often referred to as}} <b>mini-strokes.</b> Symptoms caused by a TIA resolve in 24 hours or less. TIA was originally defined clinically by the temporary nature of less than 24 hours of the associated neurologic symptoms. Recently, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) defined TIA as transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. TIAs cause the same symptoms associated with stroke, such as contralateral paralysis (opposite side of body from affected brain hemisphere) or sudden weakness or numbness. A TIA may cause sudden dimming or loss of vision (amaurosis fugax), aphasia, slurred speech (dysarthria) and mental confusion. But unlike a stroke, the symptoms of a TIA can resolve within a few minutes or within 24 hours. Brain injury may still occur in a TIA lasting only a few minutes. Having a TIA is a risk factor for eventually having a stroke or a silent stroke.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 December 2015, it was {{revealed}} that candidate Richard Woods had experienced three <b>mini-strokes</b> prior to sending in his application, but did not disclose this medical information to the show's producers, which, according to an interview he had with The Sun, were due to concerns that such disclosure would have made him appear [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "stressed". However, Richard felt that the decision was an unwise one to have taken at the time, after he admitted that in doing so he had left himself at risk of suffering [...] "a repeat stroke", which could have either left him being paralysed as a result, or worse, have been fatal for him. A show's spokesperson denied he was at risk, stating that he had good healthcare available to him and that neither Richard nor the show's doctor had seen any signs he was unfit {{to take part in the}} process. During the same interview, it was also revealed that he had delayed a medical procedure to help improve his eyesight prior to filming, with the decision influenced by the same concerns in the disclosure matter and a desire to not wear an eyepatch throughout the process. In doing so, he admitted that this had led to his eyesight deteriorating to the point that, by his final week, he was unable to see out of his left eye and thus risked losing it as a result. A news story, two days later, revealed that he had to be given 21 injections in his left eye in order to save his vision in it.|$|R
