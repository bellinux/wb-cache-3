40|$|A <b>movable</b> <b>stop</b> {{mechanism}} (MSM) {{designed to}} activate flaps {{that change the}} size and shape of a telescope aperture stop on command is described. Operating at the cryogenic temperatures of the optical system, it consists primarily of a rotary solenoid that drives (activates) dual four-bar linkages in synchronism that in turn rotate the butterfly flaps into position. The design, performance characteristics, and testing of this mechanism are discussed. Specific problems that occurred during testing and the solutions that were adopted are also described...|$|E
40|$|A {{remotely}} operable {{pressure regulator}} and shutoff valve particularly suited for achieving high resolution and flow control, and positive shutoff is described. The valve {{is characterized by}} a spring-loaded ball coaxially aligned with a fluid port to be sealed, a spring-loaded pintle extended through the port into engagement with the ball, for controlling the position, a spring-loaded diaphragm for controlling the position of the pintle, and an axially displaceable spring supported by a <b>movable</b> <b>stop</b> which, in turn, is repositioned by a selectively operable stepper motor. Thus, the pressure-response characteristics for the valve can be varied through a selective repositioning of the stop...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Electrónica) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electrónica, 2017. Cables and {{connectors}} {{represent the}} fundamental base of electronic systems without them {{most of the}} devices used daily as cell phones, tablet computers among many others, would not work. For example, if there are flaws in some inner wires of conventional cell phone use, said <b>movable</b> <b>stop</b> functioning immediately following the affected person {{would be in a}} state of confinement to replace or repair the device. For this reason, in building quality cables and connectors it is essential {{and one of the most}} important features in production. SAMTEC company reaches Costa Rica in 2006, since then produces over 1, 000 different products used in cars as well as airplanes computers at NASA and the US Army. Quality, hand in hand with performance verification systems and extensive testing 100 % of production guarantee products of high demand for efficiency and effectiveness. Being one of the goals SAMTEC the keep pace with technological growth and meet the expectations of the demanding labor market, it proposes the development of a project, which aims to eliminate production errors in connectors have cable color, which they have a color pattern set by the client and that order should not be altered. These connectors are of SFSD of SAMTEC series and assembled manually by an operator inserting each wire individually so that human error is the basis of the problem. To achieve eliminate production problems two stages were developed, the first one assisted assembly system for the operator, where using a visual aid, it shows the position and color of the cable to be inserted once the cable set, it indicates the position and color of the next cable. The second stage is a final check of the finished connector, where by a camera and Vision Builder National Instruments software, verified that all cables are in the position that corresponds as color pattern, otherwise, the system indicates that an error exists in the connector...|$|E
5000|$|Reducing the {{gas volume}} and hence {{increasing}} its internal pressure {{by means of}} a <b>movable</b> end <b>stop,</b> or allowing one tube to slide over another, can allow the characteristics of a gas spring to be adjusted during operation. The rod may be hollow by use of clever seals or may consist of multiple small-diameter rods. A small amount of oil is normally present.|$|R
5|$|When {{electrical}} wiring alone {{is used to}} connect the console to the windchest, electric actions allow the console to be separated at any practical distance {{from the rest of}} the organ, and to be <b>movable.</b> Electric <b>stop</b> actions can be controlled at the console by stop knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights. Some may include electromagnets for setting or resetting when combinations are selected.|$|R
5000|$|Consuegra {{is famous}} {{due to its}} windmills. They became famous in the 16th century, when Don Quixote was first published. The {{introduction}} of the windmills was made by [...] "Caballeros Sanjuanistas", who brought these machines that helped millers. These machines used the wind to grind grain (the most common grain is wheat). The windmills were transmitted from fathers to sons. They usually consisted of two rooms or levels. Millers had to carry sacks of grains that could weigh 60 or 70 kilos to the top floor, they rotated the sails of the windmill as the top part of the windmill or dome was <b>movable.</b> They <b>stopped</b> being used {{at the beginning of}} the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{telephones}} {{include a}} small dial {{built into the}} handset, with a <b>movable</b> finger <b>stop.</b> The user rotates the dial clockwise until the finger stop ceases moving, then releases both. In this design the holes extend around the full circumference of the dial, allowing a reduced diameter. This was introduced by Western Electric on the compact Trimline telephone, the first to locate the dial in the handset. In Spain, such phones were manufactured for CTNE (Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España) by Málaga-based factory [...] "CITESA", being named as [...] "Góndola" [...] phones by its particular shape. Spanish Góndola sets were fitted from the beginning with a red LED series connected with the line, allowing the dial ("disco" [...] in Spanish) to be back-lighted while dialling. For that, the LED was bridged by an anti-parallel Zener diode, to allow the DC to pass even if the line polarity were reversed. In case of line polarity reversal, the LED would not light, but the phone would work anyway. The LED and Zener diode were contained in the same package for ease of assembly in manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for controlling}} vehicles which are moved through a conduit by air {{and includes a}} processing system positioned in the conduit for collecting, storage and dispatching the vehicles in which an air pump is positioned in parallel with the processing system having its suction connected to the conduit upstream {{of the system and}} its discharge connected to the conduit downstream of the system. Valve means are connected to the conduit for reducing the tendency of the vehicles in the processing system to move upstream towards the pump suction. The valve means alternates the pressure in a portion of the processing system between less than atmospheric and at least atmospheric. One form of the valve means may include an air blocking vehicle <b>stop</b> <b>movable</b> {{into and out of the}} conduit and a valve connected between the conduit and the atmosphere upstream of the vehicle stop which is open and closed in synchronism with the vehicle stop. In addition, a second valve may be connected between the conduit and the pump suction upstream of the air blocking vehicle stop for speeding up the vehicle processing. In another embodiment, first and second swingable flap valves may be positioned in the conduit in the upstream portion of the processing system with an air flow control connected to the pump suction and positioned for alternately withdrawing air from the conduit upstream of each of the first and second valves for allowing the vehicles to pass through the flap valves, but preventing the application of the pump suction to the conduit downstream of the second valve.
