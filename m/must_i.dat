25|$|Kirchhoff in 1860 {{introduced}} the theoretical {{concept of a}} perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body <b>must</b> (<b>i)</b> allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body {{that are difficult to}} satisfy.|$|E

500|$|The album's title {{alludes to}} the doggy style sex {{position}} and is {{a reference to the}} musician's name. The artwork, which was done by artist Joe Cool, represents the themes covered in the album and the style of implementation of those ideas. Some critics believe the artwork portrays a woman merely as a hole to be filled by the man, which they believe adheres to the narcissistic and sexist lyrical themes Snoop Dogg covers. In this interpretation, the cover art and lyrics convey what they refer to as the self-indulgent [...] "gangsta" [...] lifestyle, drugs, cars, sex, and money. The artwork uses several quotes from the 1982 George Clinton single [...] "Atomic Dog". The quotes come from the dogs {{at the top of the}} brick wall on the album cover, which say, [...] "Why <b>must</b> <b>I</b> feel like dat?", [...] "Why <b>must</b> <b>I</b> chase da cat?"

A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny."

500|$|Following the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, a {{fatigued}} Washington {{returned to}} his estate, Mount Vernon. He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what today would be called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, {{there are some of}} every race and character. They will listen to your voice and submit to your control. You therefore <b>must,</b> <b>I</b> say must mount this seat." [...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the most}} dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment." [...] In an August 1788 letter, Washington further expounded on his feelings regarding the election, stating, ...|$|E

500|$|Between the mid-1890s and {{the late}} 1950s Vaughan Williams set more than eighty poems for voice and piano accompaniment. The {{earliest}} to survive is [...] "A Cradle Song", to Coleridge's words, from about 1894. The songs include many that have entered the repertory, such as [...] "Whither <b>Must</b> <b>I</b> Wander" [...] and [...] "Linden Lea" [...] (1902), [...] "Silent Noon" [...] (1904) and the song cycles Songs of Travel (1905 and 1907) and On Wenlock Edge. To Vaughan Williams the human voice was [...] "the oldest and greatest of musical instruments". He described his early songs as [...] "more or less simple and popular in character", and the musicologist Sophie Fuller describes this simplicity and popularity as consistent throughout his career. Many composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries wrote sentimental works for female voice; by contrast, songs by Vaughan Williams's songs such as [...] "The Vagabond" [...] from Songs of Travel, to words by Robert Louis Stevenson, are [...] "a particularly masculine breath of fresh air" [...] (Fuller), [...] "virile open-air verses" [...] (Kennedy). Some of Vaughan Williams's later songs are less well known; Fuller singles out the cycle Three Poems by Walt Whitman, a largely dark work, as too often overlooked by singers and critics. For some of his songs the composer expands the accompaniment to include two or more string instruments {{in addition to the}} piano; they include On Wenlock Edge, and the Chaucer cycle Merciless Beauty (1921), judged by an anonymous contemporary critic as [...] "surely among the best of modern English songs".|$|E
