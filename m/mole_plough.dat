25|$|Following {{the failure}} of his first steam-driven plough, Fowler reverted to the design used for his second horse-driven plough. His new design {{consisted}} of a steam engine placed {{in a corner of}} the field driving a winch. A rope led from the winch along the side of the field, around a securely anchored pulley and across the field to the <b>mole</b> <b>plough.</b> As the winch drew in the rope the <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> was drawn across the field digging a drainage channel as it went. The engine also had a second winch with a rope passing round the same anchored pulley and then passing across the field and around a second pulley and back to the plough. This second rope would be used to drag the plough back to its starting point after completing a drainage line. Both pulleys would then be re-anchored at both ends of the next channel to be dug and the ploughing process would be repeated. The steam plough was demonstrated at the Royal Agricultural Society of England meeting at Lincoln in 1854.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{might have}} {{remained}} with the Middlesbrough firm {{and made his}} reputation there, {{had it not been}} for a chance visit to Ireland in 1849, probably on business. This was at the time of the Irish potato famine, and Irish agriculture depended on the potato crop whilst much of the land was uncultivated due to poor drainage. This affected Fowler and he was convinced that there must be a way of bringing more land into production. The normal way to drain agricultural land was to use a <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> to dig a subterranean drainage channel. The <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> has a vertical blade with a cylindrical “mole” attached to the bottom. The mole is pointed at the front end, and as it moves through the soil, it leaves a horizontal channel into which porous drainage pipes can be laid. However this required considerable tractive power, so that the size of the plough was limited by the strength of the teams of horses that pulled it. Fowler returned to England and developed a horse-powered ploughing engine that would dig drainage channels.|$|E
25|$|Mole ploughs {{are usually}} trailed and pulled by a crawler tractor, but lighter models {{for use on}} the three-point linkage of {{powerful}} four-wheel drive tractors are also made. A <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> {{has a very strong}} frame which slides along the ground when the machine is in work. A heavy leg, similar to a subsoiler leg, is attached to the frame and a circular section share with a larger diameter expander on a flexible link is bolted to the leg. The bullet shaped share forms a tunnel, about 75mm diameter, in the soil and the expander presses the soil outwards to form a long-lasting drainage channel.|$|E

25|$|Heavy land {{requires}} draining {{to reduce}} its water content to a level satisfactory for efficient plant growth. Heavy soils usually have a system of permanent drains using either perforated plastic or clay pipes which discharge into a ditch. <b>Mole</b> <b>ploughs</b> are used to form small tunnels (mole drains) in the soil {{at a depth of}} up to 950mm (30in) at an angle to the pipe drains. Water from the mole drains seeps into the pipes and runs along them into a ditch.|$|R
50|$|Many modern land drains {{are created}} utilising rigid or {{flexible}} plastic pipes pierced with holes, laid in pea gravel. (The pea gravel is pea-sized pebbles without sharp points {{to damage the}} pipe.) Geotextile material can surround the gravel to keep out silt. This can be installed in an excavated trench. Specialised <b>mole</b> <b>ploughs</b> are available that can form the hole, insert the perforated pipe (and gravel if required), all in one simultaneous and continuous process. An extremely powerful (usually tracked) tractor is necessary. The flexible pipe is carried as a roll {{on the back of}} the machine. There is a sometimes a hopper for gravel which is kept topped up by an adjacent machine. The pipe and gravel go down apertures in the plough blade as the tractor proceeds along the desired route.|$|R

Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|E

40|$|European moles are {{widespread}} in both cultivated and uncultivated areas in Poland. Their occurrence and distribution {{in relation to}} the physical and chemical characteristics of soil has been already studied in previous research. However, there is still an open question {{about the impact of the}} structure of anthropogenic habitats produced by agriculture on moles. The main aim of this study is to assess the influence of different kinds of field margins on the presence and spatial distribution of the European mole Talpa europaea L. in farmlands. Methods included the monitoring of six investigative sites in northern Poland. Observations were made during three six-month periods in 2005 - 2008 of the presence or absence of moles as recognized by recent molehills and surface tunnels. There was a very clear tendency by moles to occupy areas within arable fields close to field boundaries with wide verges containing ruderal and woodland communities with a spacious zone of ecotones. Narrow boundary strips were avoided by moles. In conclusion, the conducted research confirms that field margins have an impact on the presence and spatial distribution of <b>moles</b> within <b>ploughed</b> lands. Our results may be helpful in improving the relation between agricultural development and biodiversity conservation, and the rational use of nature by humankind...|$|R

This study aimed to explore the condition of the mole drainage formed in paddy soil with different clay contents. The study was conducted in a laboratory scale using a soil bin, a model of <b>mole</b> <b>plough,</b> and soil which was kept homogeneous in the boxes. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory for Energy and Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta. Mole drainage was installed in 3 paddy soils with different clay content, namely; 13. 12 % (soil A; loam soil), 41. 17 % (soil B; clay soil) and 53. 36 % (soil C; clay soil). The study was conducted by analyzing the geometry of the mole drainage and observing the soil deformation which occurred due to the formation of the mole drainage. The study showed that perfect mole drainages were installed in all of those three types of soil. The mole drainages were quite good and stable with little cracks. Based on the soil crack and ﬁ ssuring of soil, the largest soil deformation has occurred in soil with the highest clay content and the smallest one in soil with the lowest clay content.

No-tillage has been shown to avoid many of these problems but the question remains: "Where soils are compact, what combination of deep tillage and/or drainage systems and no-tillage allow for the most efficient transition from conventional cultivation to no-tillage crop establishment?" The objective {{of this study was to}} ascertain if soil properties, and crop (Brassica campestis x Brassica napus cv "Pasja" followed by wheat Triticum aestivum cv "Kohika") establishment and yield on land converted from a conventionally tilled system to a no-tillage system could be improved by various subsoiling and <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> operations. Plots on a Milson silt loam (Argillic Perch-Gley Pallic Soil) (Typic Ochraqualf) were paraplowed (PP), straight-legged subsoiled (SL), mole ploughed (M) or were left as non-subsoiled controls (C) in the autumn of 1997. Forage brassica was then sown with a Cross-Slot™ no-tillage drill. Wheat was established on the same plots with the same no-tillage drill in the spring of 1997. Subsoiling initially reduced soil strength by a significant amount. Shortly after subsoiling cone indices showed disruption to 300 mm with PP, 350 mm with SL and 100 mm with M. At the same time, approximately 20 % of profile cone indices from subsoiled treatments were greater than 2 MPa, compared to approximately 52 % for C and M. At 267 days after subsoiling, PP continued to have lower cone index values than C and M. Subsoiling initially reduced bulk density. When measured in May, the bulk density of PP plots was significantly lower than SL, M and C although reconsolidation in all plots was observed in February 1998 after the wheat was harvested. Air permeability in PP, SL and M was significantly greater than in C. Despite the differences in soil strength and bulk density (but not air permeability), subsoiling and mole ploughing did not produce differences in plant populations or yield for either the winter brassica or spring-sown wheat crops. The lack of any differences for brassica crop performance criteria were in spite of the vertical rooting depth being greater in the PP treatment. The lack of differences in plant establishment and yield was thought to be due to the relatively dry autumn and winter soil conditions and the use of the Cross-Slot™ no-tillage opener which is reported to be tolerant of variable soil conditions...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} research study was established at IGER, North Wyke, Devon, to investigate preferential flow through a poorly structured relatively impermeable soil. Macropore channels were added by a <b>mole</b> <b>plough</b> {{in order to}} investigate soil water pathways and chemical transport in a soil in which preferential flow was guaranteed. The investigation focused on water and solute movement through specific flowpaths, namely macropores and mesopores, and the interaction between mobile and immobile zones within the soil. Two large soil blocks (1 m 2 by 0. 85 m) of the Hallsworth series {{were removed from the}} field and placed on sand tables so that a suction could be induced {{at the base of the}} soil block. The edge was sealed using paraffin wax. Eight tensiometers and suction cup lysimeters were installed in each block together with fifteen pairs of time-domain reflectometry wave guides. A regular spacing pattern was employed so that spatial variations could be easily identified. Samples were collected from suction cup lysimeters every 4 hours. Soil water status was observed from the TDR probes daily and from tensiometers every 10 minutes. Five tracer experiments were conducted; three involved the miscible displacement of chloride at concentrations of 100 and 250 mg I"' and two used nitrate (500 mg l ') and chloride (2500 mg 1 ') applied as a pulse. Tracer and irrigation water was applied through a misting system at an irrigation rate of 2. 76 mm h- 1. Three techniques were used to examine soil structure in the macropore and mesopore pore size range to investigate potential flowpaths in more detail. The profile tracing method (PTM). binary transect method (BTM) and resinated core section method (RCSM) provided useful quantitative structural information. Soil water status averaged over a large sampling volume (TDR, 1540000 mm 3) was considered to be stable through time. Detailed observations of soil water suction using tensiometers showed that soil water conditions remained unsaturated, at approximately 10 to 20 cm H 2 O, and varied by 3 cm H 2 O throughout the experiment. Suction varied depending on the location of each tensiometer with respect to position within or between aggregates. Results based on Poiseuille's law and suction data showed that the flowpaths were predominantly mesopores. This result was supported by breakthrough curve analysis for the bulk of the soil although macropore flow was observed towards the mole drain. Flow rates observed from tracer movement varied throughout the soil regardless of depth. Chloride moved quickly towards the mole drain and the arrival of tracer was recorded within 4 hours. Time to breakthrough monitored at the suction cups varied from 4 to 76 hours. When the concentration gradient between applied solute and antecedent solute was large, reduced time to attain peak concentration was noted. As the concentration gradient reduced, speed of rise to peak concentration increased. An advection-dispersion model (CLEARY) fitted change in observed solute concentration through time at the suction cup lysimeters well. The study concluded that although water moved rapidly through the soil, the tortuous nature and increased contact with soil particles encountered as water moved through the mesopores resulted in water with matrix flow solute characteristics.
