Korea <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> {{is the same as}} Japan <b>Standard</b> <b>Time,</b> Indonesian Eastern <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> and Yakutsk Time. North Korea was also on Korea <b>Standard</b> <b>Time,</b> but in August 2015 adopted Pyongyang <b>Standard</b> <b>Time,</b> which is 30 minutes behind.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act of 1918 {{authorized}} the Interstate Commerce Commission to define each time zone. The United States <b>Standard</b> Alaska <b>Time</b> was designated as UTC−10. [...] Some references prior to 1967 {{refer to this}} zone as Central Alaska <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (CAT) or as Alaska <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (AST). In 1966, the Uniform Time Act renamed the UTC−10 zone to Alaska-Hawaii <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (AHST), effective April 1, 1967. [...] This zone was renamed in 1983 to Hawaii-Aleutian <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (HAST) when the majority of Alaska was {{moved out of the}} zone.|$|R

50|$|The Galápagos Islands in Ecuador uses Central <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> all year-round; the {{remainder}} of Ecuador uses Eastern <b>Standard</b> <b>Time.</b> Both Easter Island and Salas y Gómez Island in Chile uses Central <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> during the Southern Hemisphere winter and Central Daylight Time during the Southern Hemisphere summer; {{the remainder}} of Chile uses Atlantic <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> and Atlantic Daylight Time.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act 1968 legally {{established}} that the time for general purposes in the State (to be known as <b>standard</b> <b>time)</b> shall be one hour in advance of Greenwich mean time throughout the year. This act was amended by the <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (Amendment) Act 1971, which legally established Greenwich Mean Time as a winter time period. Ireland therefore operates one hour behind <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> during the winter period, and reverts to <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> in the summer months. This is defined {{in contrast to the}} other states in the European Union, which operate one hour ahead of <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> during the summer period, but produces the same end result.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Virgin Islands {{are located}} in the Atlantic <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> zone and do not {{participate}} in daylight saving time. When the mainland United States is on <b>Standard</b> <b>Time,</b> the U.S. Virgin Islands are one hour ahead of Eastern <b>Standard</b> <b>Time.</b> When the mainland United States is on daylight saving time, Eastern Daylight Time is the same as Atlantic <b>Standard</b> <b>Time.</b>|$|R

While Korea came under Japanese rule in 1910, Korea <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> of UTC+8:30 continued to be used until 1912, when it was changed to Central <b>Standard</b> <b>Time.</b>|$|R

MMT is calculated {{on the basis}} of 97° 30' longitude. MMT is used all year round as Myanmar does not observe daylight saving time.|$|R
50|$|Use of <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> {{gradually}} increased {{because of}} its obvious practical advantages for communication and travel. <b>Standard</b> <b>time</b> in time zones was not established in U.S. law until the <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act of 1918 of March 19, 1918, {{also known as the}} Calder Act (15 USC 260).

50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>time</b> was not enacted into US law {{until the}} 1918 <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act {{established}} <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> in time zones; {{the law also}} instituted daylight saving time (DST). The daylight saving time portion of the law was repealed in 1919 over a presidential veto, but was reestablished nationally during World War II. In 2007 the US enacted a federal law formalizing the use of Coordinated Universal Time {{as the basis of}} <b>standard</b> <b>time,</b> {{and the role of the}} Secretary of Commerce (effectively, the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the Secretary of the Navy (effectively, the U.S. Naval Observatory) in interpreting <b>standard</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the time}} zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTC−12 to UTC+14), but a few zones are offset by 30 or 45 minutes (e.g. Newfoundland <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> is UTC−03:30, Nepal <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> is UTC+05:45, and Indian <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> is UTC+05:30).|$|R

50|$|If {{the rows}} in {{a fact table}} are coming from several timezones, it might be useful to store date and time in both local <b>time</b> and a <b>standard</b> <b>time.</b> This {{can be done by}} having two {{dimensions}} for each date/time dimension needed - one for local time, and one for <b>standard</b> <b>time.</b> Storing date/time in both local and <b>standard</b> <b>time,</b> will allow for analysis on when facts are created in a local setting and in a global setting as well.
