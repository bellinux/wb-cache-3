40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{readers to}} a variety of tools for analog layout design automation. After discussing the placement and routing problem in electronic design automation (EDA), the authors overview a variety of automatic layout generation tools, as well as the most recent advances in analog layout-aware circuit sizing. The discussion includes different methods for automatic placement (a template-based Placer and an optimization-based Placer), a fully-automatic Router and an empirical-based Parasitic Extractor. The concepts and algorithms of all the modules are thoroughly described, enabling readers to reproduce the methodologies, improve the quality of their designs, or use them as starting point for a new tool. All the methods described are applied to practical examples for a 130 nm design process, as well as placement and routing benchmark sets. Introduces readers to hierarchical combination of Pareto fronts of placements; Presents electromigration-aware routing with multilayer <b>multiport</b> <b>terminal</b> structures; Includes evolutionary multi-objective multi-constraint detailed Router; Enables parasitic extraction performed over a semi-complete layout...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{literature}} on very large scale integration routing and wiring estimation typically assumes a one-to-one correspondence between terminals and ports. In practice, however, each "terminal" {{consists of a}} large collection of electrically equivalent ports, a fact that is not accounted for in layout steps such as wiring estimation. In this paper, we address the general problem of minimum-cost routing tree construction {{in the presence of}} <b>multiport</b> <b>terminals,</b> which gives rise to the group Steiner minimal tree problem. Our main result is the first known approximation algorithm for the group Steiner problem with a sublinear performance bound. In particular, for a net with k <b>multiport</b> <b>terminals,</b> previous heuristics have a performance bound of (k- 1) * OPT, while our construction offers an improved performance bound of 2 * (2 + ln(k/ 2)) * VT OPT. Our Java implementation is available on the Web...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{circuits}} {{composed of}} linear multiconductor transmission lines and terminated with nonlinear weakly active multiport resistors are considered. The line is {{represented as a}} linear dynamic multiport through recursive convolution relations and special considerations are given to some general properties of the line impulse responses. The convolution technique allows the mathematical description of these distributed circuits {{by means of a}} sea: of nonlinear algebraic-integral equations of Volterra type for the terminal voltages and currents. The conditions under which these governing equations can he reformulated as a set of Volterra integral equations of second kind in normal form are given with the explicit means for doing so. These conditions also assure the existence and the uniqueness of the solution. In particular if the <b>terminal</b> <b>multiport</b> resistors are strictly locally passive, then the normal form exists and the solution is unique. Transmission lines with <b>terminal</b> <b>multiport</b> resistors that are locally active may not admit a normal form for the governing equations, and hence, several solutions that have the same initial conditions are possible, In these cases a simple method is presented for revising the original network model so that the normal form exists, and hence, the uniqueness of solution is assured, under mild restrictions...|$|R
40|$|Multiport {{antenna systems}} are {{indispensable}} part of modern wireless communication systems. Their crucial {{impact on the}} overall performance requires sufficient regard and dedication to a precise design and characterisation. This concern has been to a considerable extent addressed {{in the frame of}} the current thesis. The thesis starts by a brief review of the evolution on wireless communication systems. In particular, the role of multiport antennas in modern communication systems is highlighted. The multidisciplinary nature of <b>multiport</b> radiation <b>terminals</b> makes them the subject of many research groups worldwide, resulting in inconsistent nomenclature. Thus, a few words are dedicated to throwing light upon some important metrics in this discipline. The notion of richness threshold as a further crucial performance metric is introduced. The importance of the latter parameter is emphasised by virtue of some practical examples. We describe how an RF Butler network can be used to remarkably enhance the performance of spatial diversity systems. Subsequently, the advantage of a predictor antenna system in modern moving relays is underlined. We illustrate and quantify how the coupling removal can improve the prediction capability of this system. This can be most conveniently carried out through signal processing, amplifying the prediction reliability. To verify the foregoing achievement, some results associated with measurements in actual scenarios are presented. Moreover, a quick and inexpensive measurement of antennas in multipath environments is of foremost concern for antenna system designers. This issue is simply possible by reverberation chamber technologies. We briefly clarify how further analysis can be utilised to facilitate measurements in these chambers. At the end, we devote a short discussion to some state-of-the-art antenna designs which are suitable for the modern compact mobile terminals, manifesting certain rewarding features...|$|R
