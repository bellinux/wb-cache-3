5|$|After {{retreating}} into Arcadia {{and receiving}} {{news of his}} wife's death, Cleomenes returned to Sparta. This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum—which he gave to <b>Megalopolis.</b> He continued to Aegium, where the Achaeans were holding their council. He gave a report on his operations and was made chief-in-command of all the allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus {{attempted}} to exploit Pyrrhus' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom. However, his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful {{as he was}} defeated in battle by Pyrrhus' son, Ptolemy. Unperturbed by Antigonus' offensive, Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in Achaia. The Epiriote army marched to <b>Megalopolis,</b> a central Peloponnesian city which lay {{on the border with}} Sparta. Several of Sparta's neighbours, namely <b>Megalopolis,</b> Elis and many of the Achaians poleis, supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region. While his force was camped at <b>Megalopolis,</b> Pyrrhus received ambassadors from Messene, Athens, the Achaian League and Sparta. In response to the Spartans' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion, Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys. He told the Spartans that he had come to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to send his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the agoge. However, when the emissaries returned to Sparta, Pyrrhus advanced into Laconia. He advanced south, following the course of the Eurotas River and ravaging the lands of the Spartan perioeci. It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of Alifeira in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the Parnon region of Laconia. Pyrrhus' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him.|$|E

5|$|Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors {{to allow}} him to {{continue}} his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of <b>Megalopolis</b> and captured the village of Leuctra. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based nearest the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but Lydiadas of <b>Megalopolis</b> disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans. Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.|$|E

Pyrrhus appears to have received support for his invasion from some of Sparta's neighbours, namely Elis, <b>Megalopolis</b> and some Achaian cities which would profit from reduced Spartan power. In response to the Spartan emissaries' inquiries as to his intentions, the Epiriote King managed to deceive them. Pyrrhus asserted that his aim in invading the Peloponnese was to liberate the cities still held by Antigonus and to send his sons to Sparta to be educated in the agoge. After the withdrawal of the ambassadors, the Epiriote army advanced into Laconia followed the Eurotas River south and started to ravaging the territory of the Spartan perioeci.

5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from <b>Megalopolis</b> {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return.

5|$|In 229 BC, Cleomenes {{took the}} {{important}} cities Tegea, Mantineia, Caphyae and Orchomenus in Arcadia, who had by then allied {{themselves with the}} Aetolian League, a powerful Greek confederation of city states in central Greece. Historians Polybius and Sir William Smith claim that Cleomenes seized the cities by treachery; however, Richard Talbert, who translated Plutarch's account of Sparta, and historian N. G. L. Hammond say Cleomenes occupied them at their own request. Later that year, the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize the Athenaeum, near Belbina.

The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs of}} the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with <b>Megalopolis</b> against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece {{the only}} {{disturbance}} to Macedonian rule was the {{attempt by the}} Spartan king Agis III to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against the Macedonians. However, he was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of <b>Megalopolis</b> by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Although the governor of Thrace, Memnon, had threatened to rebel, it appears that Antipater dissuaded him with diplomacy before campaigning against Agis III in the Peloponnese. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install them in the first place).|$|E

40|$|In {{common with}} other {{developing}} regions, the current wave of globalization in East Asia {{has been associated}} with a concentration of economic activities in <b>megalopolises.</b> The price paid {{for the benefit of the}} agglomeration economies resulting from this urban concentration has been formidable congestion and pollution. Income inequality has also increased. Migrants, who typically find initial employment in the urban informal sector, generally receive wages that are much lower than those of workers employed in the formal sector, where labor is protected by labor codes and unions. The widening income disparities have been a major source of social and political instability, as epitomized by higher crime rates and the greater frequency of riots. A popular perception prevails that identifies these trends as an inevitable consequence of the integration of developing economies with the world economy as globalization progresses. However, globalization, which is characterized by the freer movement of goods and services across national borders, does not necessarily cause urban concentration and rural marginalization. Many industrial activities, especially labor-intensive manufactures such as cloth, garments, and standard electronic parts, which are characterized by weak economies of scale and modest transportation costs, need not be located in <b>megalopolises...</b>|$|R

However, at the critical moment, Philopoemon of <b>Megalopolis</b> (who later became one of the greatest heroes of the Achaean League, eventually conquering Sparta), tried to point out the danger to the senior cavalry commanders. When they did not take notice of him, Philopoemon gathered a few other cavalrymen and charged the Spartan cavalry. The Spartans attacking from the rear broke off their engagement with the enemy, which encouraged the Macedonians to charge at the Spartan positions.

5|$|The Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD) {{was created}} on April 2, 1917 to {{construct}} and maintain a system of state highways across Delaware. As a result, the state took over construction of the DuPont Highway. The DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast <b>megalopolis.</b> Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the State Aid Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) has {{experienced}} rapid urbanization and dramatic economic development since 1978 and the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) {{has been one}} of the three largest urban agglomerations in China. We present evidence of a significant urban heat island (UHI) effect on climate warming based on an analysis of the impacts of the urbanization rate, urban population, and land use changes on the warming rate of the daily average, minimal (nighttime) and maximal (daytime) air temperature in the YRDUA using 41 meteorological stations observation data. The effect of the UHI on climate warming shows a large spatial variability. The average warming rates of average air temperature of huge cities, <b>megalopolises,</b> large cities, medium-sized cities, and small cities are 0. 483, 0. 314 ± 0. 030, 0. 282 ± 0. 042, 0. 225 ± 0. 044 and 0. 179 ± 0. 046 °C/decade during the period of 1957 – 2013, respectively. The average warming rates of huge cities and <b>megalopolises</b> are significantly higher than those of medium-sized cities and small cities, indicating that the UHI has a significant effect on climate warming (t-test, p < 0. 05).

" The newly defined <b>megalopolises</b> and metropolises {{are under}} unprecedented pressure from various eco-environmental problems, making them suitable representatives {{for exploring the}} state of urban ecosystem health. In this study, we establish a two-layer indicator system to assess the urban ecosystem health and choose 33 indicators grouped into social, economic, transportation, facility, land, and management subsystems, {{with the aim of}} correlating human activities with the structure, vigor, resilience, and health of the urban ecosystem. We integrate subjective and objective methods to determine weights at different levels through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the analytic hierarchy process, and information entropy. In particular, we develop a spatial TOPSIS technique by introducing a Euclidean-distance-based weight to rank the health of the cities' ecosystem in terms of the spatial effects among these cities. The results reveal that <b>megalopolises</b> such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have superior social and economic subsystems, whereas other megacities have advantages in transportation, facility, land, and management subsystems. From 2005 to 2010, the gaps among these cities in terms of urban ecosystem health significantly reduced regardless of the weight determination method. Not all indicators involved can help realize a better urban ecosystem. Nevertheless, they provide a reference point for making specific regulations to control human activity and improve eco-environmental management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
