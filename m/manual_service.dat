25|$|The Bell System {{dial service}} {{implemented}} a feature called automatic number identification (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll-free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In <b>manual</b> <b>service,</b> the operator knows where a call is originating {{by the light}} on the switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it on a paper toll ticket.|$|E
25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had <b>manual</b> <b>service</b> and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large NÂ°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|E

2500|$|Before 1949, San Jose {{telephones}} were <b>manual</b> <b>service.</b> A subscriber {{would lift}} {{the receiver and}} wait for the operator to inquire, [...] "Number Please?" [...] Most telephone numbers started with Ballard or Columbia. Mayfair numbers served the east side. The City Manager's number was Ballard 1 while most numbers had four digits and a letter, (for example: Ballard 2345 W). One of four letters was appended to telephone numbers: J, M, R, or W. These letters may have tipped off the operator as to the proper keys to press to ring a subscriber who was on a party line.|$|E
2500|$|With <b>manual</b> <b>service,</b> the {{customer}} lifts the receiver off-hook and asks the operator {{to connect the}} call to a requested number. Provided that the number {{is in the same}} central office, and located on the operator's switchboard, the operator connects the call by plugging the ringing cord into the jack on the switchboard corresponding to the called customer's line. If the called party's line is on a different switchboard in the same office, or in a different central office, the operator plugs into the trunk for the destination switchboard or office and asks the operator answering (known as the [...] "B" [...] operator) to connect the call.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{mobile phone}} systems were first {{introduced}} {{in the years after}} the Second World War and made use of technology developed before and during the conflict. The first system opened in St Louis, Missouri, USA in 1946 whilst other countries followed in the succeeding decades. The UK introduced its 'System 1' manual radiotelephone service as the South Lancashire Radiophone Service in 1958. [...] Calls were made via an operator using handsets identical to ordinary phone handsets. The phone itself was a large box located in the boot (trunk) of the vehicle containing valves and other early electronic components. Although an uprated <b>manual</b> <b>service</b> ('System 3') was extended to cover most of the UK, automation did not arrive until 1981 with 'System 4'. [...] Although this non-cellular service, based on German B-Netz technology, was expanded rapidly throughout the UK between 1982 and 1985 and continued in operation for several years before finally closing in Scotland, it was overtaken by the introduction in January 1985 of two cellular systems - the British Telecom/Securicor 'Cellnet' service and the Racal/Millicom/Barclays 'Vodafone' (from voice + data + phone) service. These cellular systems were based on US Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) technology, the modified technology being named Total Access Communication System (TACS).|$|E

[...] This routing would allow the Los Angeles operator to dial via the tandem switch (i.e., class-4 telephone switch) to the Mount Pleasant operatorâs switchboard, and have the call come in on a special special trunk (designated by the 181 code) used for incoming calls to ring-down points (places with <b>manual</b> <b>service</b> whose connection to the national network was via a larger point).|$|E

50|$|Telephone service {{conversion}} from manual to dial systems was {{slowed by}} equipment shortages during World War II. San Jose {{had been planned}} for conversion before the war, but remained on <b>manual</b> <b>service</b> until 1949. In preparation for operator direct distance dialing, the precursor to customer DDD, cities throughout the country converted telephone numbers to a standardized 2L-5N format, e.g. EXchange 1-2345. San Francisco completed its conversion in December 1947. In July 1948, Pacific Telephone converted most of the cities on the San Francisco Peninsula. The company announcement, âmost Peninsula cities now have exchange namesâ confirmed that the old four- or five-digit numbers had been converted to the seven-digit exchange format.|$|E
5000|$|Routings were {{important}} during the 1950s and 1960s, when many medium-sized and smaller cities had automatic service, {{but were not}} yet reachable by the growing numbers of people in cities with direct dialing. For example, if by the late 1950s, our fictional [...] "Fountain Green" [...] had upgraded its <b>manual</b> <b>service</b> with an automatic (dial enabled four-digit number) one, an operator could often dial the call after obtaining the Rate and Route would quote ("Numbers 801 plus 833 plus 4D. Operators 801 plus 073 plus."). The operator could add 833, to the local four digit number, which in a few years, would become the seven digit number for the residents.|$|E
