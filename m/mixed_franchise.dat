40|$|This thesis investigates two questions: the {{determinants}} of capital structure in franchising and its subsequent impact on the franchise financing decisions; and the efficient governance structure choice in franchising. We posit that firms franchise in order {{to benefit from the}} reduced franchisees’ operational risks by limiting the debt level, such that the franchisor can bear more debt and gain tax-deduction benefits. Specific hypotheses are based on various theories like resource-based view, agency theory, signaling theory and classical capital structure theories. We empirically find that as the franchisor requires franchisees to put more equity in the initial investment, the franchisor does bear a higher debt level and gains from tax deductibility of interest expenses. This effect is stronger when more units are franchised. Moreover, we also find evidence supporting our prediction that the franchisee’s leverage is positively linked with franchisor’s maturity. This suggests that as the franchisor imposes a higher level of franchisee’s leverage in order to screen capable franchisees, the franchisor also increases their maturity to reduce bankruptcy risks. This thesis also explores the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor as well as the distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and <b>mixed</b> <b>franchise</b> systems are considered. Circumstances are identified when a dual distribution governance structure uniquely allocates efficient ownership over assets. A necessary condition for the efficiency of a dual distribution governance structure is a positive systemic effect, not the value of the brand name or location (or other) differences between outlets. We find that whether dual distribution benefits are realized in a franchise or a cooperative franchise depends on whether most value is added upstream or downstream...|$|E

Drawing insights from case studies that indicate both the development and the maintenance of company-wide brand names and unit-specific sales activities are crucial to a franchise company, we construct a multitask model to account for such contract <b>mixing</b> in <b>franchising.</b> Intuitively, low-powered contracts are offered to some managers to induce effort for brand-name development and maintenance, while high-powered contracts are offered to the remaining managers to elicit sales activity and capture the beneficial effect of the company brand name.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{explaining}} governance structure variety in franchising, we explore the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor {{as well as the}} distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and <b>mixed</b> (dual distribution) <b>franchise</b> systems are considered. Circumstances are identified when a dual distribution governance structure uniquely allocates efficient ownership over assets. Whether dual distribution benefits are realized in a franchise or a cooperative franchise depends on whether most value is added upstream or downstream. A disadvantage of a dual distribution system is the deterioration of the investment incentives of the party having no authority, i. e. either the company-owned outlet manager in a traditional franchise or the franchisor in a cooperative franchise. A wholly-franchised system may therefore be efficient even when unique dual distribution benefits are present. A necessary condition for the efficiency of a dual distribution governance structure is a positive systemic effect, not the value of the brand name or location (or other) differences between outlets.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the adoption}} of a <b>mix</b> of <b>franchised</b> and company-owned outlets among firms, namely, contractual heterogeneity within the firm. Contractual heterogeneity is explained by the existing literature as due to heterogeneous characteristics of the downstream outlets of a company. Such correspondence, however, is arguably at variance with reality. Furthermore, this literature {{has not been able to}} provide an answer to contractual heterogeneity in the presence of downstream homogeneity. This study contributes to the subject by proposing one such answer. The investigation is presented in two main parts. The first part provides a theoretical analysis of the problem and sets out a model representing the explanation proposed. The second part consists of an empirical investigation of the hypotheses set out in the first part. This empirical investigation is based ofdata collected by means of a survey of UK firms conducted specifically for the purpose of this study. The empirical analysis is performed by means of both a qualitative and an econometric study. The explanation uncovered by our theory, supported by our empirical results, shows that under certain conditions contract mixing represents a separating equilibrium which enables the company upstream (principal) to overcome problems related to hidden action, hidden information and uncertainty downstream. Under certain circumstances such organisational structure represents the 'optimal choice' for the principal in the trade-off between incentives and risk sharing. At the same time, it proves to be optimal for the heterogeneous agents (downstream) by providing them with their maximum level of expected utility. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that investigates both sides of this agency relationship. In other words, this study demonstrates that the choice of a 'mixed' organisational firm can be driven by efficiency reasons rather than competition reducing targets by the firm...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Hotel, Restaurant, Institution Management and DieteticsSooCheong JangDeborah D. CanterIn {{the last}} few decades, {{franchising}} has {{become a part of}} everyday life in the United States. Many firms in a variety of industries have adopted franchising as a method of doing business. Despite the importance of franchising, the literature on why firms initially choose to franchise and how franchising affects financial performance has been scant (Combs et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2005). The purposes of this study were 1) to examine how well agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk-sharing theory, and specific knowledge theory justify the franchising decision, 2) to investigate whether franchising affects restaurant firms' market value and profitability, and 3) to investigate the relationship between the ownership <b>mix,</b> combination of <b>franchised</b> and company-owned outlets, and financial performance. For the statistical analysis, the data were collected from the Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT database, Bond's Franchise Guide and 10 K reports. A logistic regression model was developed to identify a set of variables that best differentiated firms engaged in franchise contracts from those that were not. The statistical results indicated that: 1) Young and growing firms used franchise more to increase the flow of resources. This result supported resource scarcity theory. 2) The degree of geographic dispersion and involvement in foreign countries increased the probability of a firm's decision to franchise. These results supported agency theory. 3) The decrease of specific knowledge requirements increased the franchising probability. This result supported specific knowledge theory. T-tests and multivariate regression models were used to test how franchising affects firms' financial performance. The findings indicated that 1) franchised firms had better financial performance than non-franchised firms, 2) the relationship between ownership mix and financial performance was curvilinear and the inverted U-shaped relationship suggested the existence of optimal ownership mix that can maximize a firm's financial performance, and 3) ownership mix not only directly affected a firm's intangible assets, but also indirectly affected a firm's intangible assets through advertising. This study found that a purely company owned or a purely franchised chain did not produce the best financial performance. Restaurant companies could use both company-owned and franchised units to leverage the strengths of one another, which will yield a better overall financial performance than if either structure was to operate alone...|$|R
