5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E
5|$|Much of Khalid's {{strategic}} and tactical genius lies in {{his use of}} extreme methods. He apparently put <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> annihilating enemy troops, rather than achieving victory by simply defeating them. For instance his employment of the double envelopment maneuver against the numerically superior Persian army at the Battle of Walaja, and his maneuver at the Battle of Yarmouk where he virtually trapped the Byzantine army between three steep ravines by stealthily capturing their only escape route, a bridge, at their rear.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E

5|$|The ICD-10 {{criteria}} are typically used in European countries, while the DSM {{criteria are}} used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies.

The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom.|$|E
5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account has been questioned by recent scholarship, which places <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E
5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|Mother's Milk is {{the fourth}} studio album by American funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on August 16, 1989, by EMI Records. After the death of founding guitarist Hillel Slovak and subsequent departure of drummer Jack Irons, vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea regrouped {{with the addition of}} guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith. Frusciante's influence altered the band's sound by placing <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> melody than rhythm, which had dominated the band's previous material. Returning producer Michael Beinhorn favored heavy metal guitar riffs as well as overdubbing that was perceived by Frusciante as excessive, and as a result Beinhorn and Frusciante constantly fought over the album's guitar sound.|$|E

5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School {{borrowed}} many concepts from Buddhism, {{including the}} concept of reincarnation, and also some cosmological elements. Although reincarnation was an important concept in the Lingbao School, the earlier Daoist belief in attaining immortality remained. The school's pantheon is similar to Shangqing and Celestial Master Daoism, with {{one of its most}} important gods being the deified form of Laozi. Other gods also existed, some of whom were in charge of preparing spirits for reincarnation. Lingbao ritual was initially in individual practice, but later went through a transformation that put <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> collective rites. The most important scripture in the Lingbao School is known as the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was compiled by Ge Chaofu and based on Ge Hong's earlier alchemical works.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{began work}} on a sequel to Better than Life, called The Last Human, but Rob Grant was drawn away from Red Dwarf by an {{interest}} in other projects. Still owing Penguin Publishing two more Red Dwarf novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, is more {{in keeping with the}} previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E

5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had less of an impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it {{was not the first time}} he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced the Frenchman to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|Katharine Hepburn {{joined the}} cast in mid-April 1942 after Stewart {{sent her a}} copy of the {{unfinished}} script. Hepburn was fascinated by the character of Christine, and felt that doing the film would be a way of contributing to the war effort. MGM executives did not want Hepburn attached to the picture, feeling it was an inappropriate follow-up for her (first) previous pairing with Tracy in Woman of the Year (1942), but Hepburn insisted, and MGM relented. Hepburn showed some concerns with Stewart's redrafting of the script, in that he toned down the novel's love story, placing <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the character of O'Malley role and the action. She asked for more romance in the film. Although Hepburn had spent much of the prior year searching for scripts with equally strong male and female parts for her and Tracy, she now requested that the O'Malley role be restored to the function it served in the novel (where O'Malley is impotent, troubled, and despairing of love) and her own part expanded. Film producer Victor Saville threatened to resign if the changes were made, and Spencer Tracy supported him, which led to the changes being rejected.|$|E
