Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system {{in order to allow}} a transplant to engraft. Cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner, and is often used in conjunction with total body irradiation. Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (<b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning)</b> or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning).

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this article}} is to compare the {{differences}} in efficacy and toxicity between the various conditioning regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies, all retrospective, that compare the impact of various different conditioning regimens amongst each other are presented. Reduced intensity conditioning apparently lowered transplant-related mortality in patients with minimal residual disease who were at high risk for treatment-related mortality. In contrast, patients with active disease could only be salvaged when a <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen was used. By consequence, it was concluded that patients without contraindications for a <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen should not receive reduced regimens outside a prospective randomized trial. SUMMARY: Despite high expectations, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens that have been reduced in intensity did not prove to be superior in survival when the outcomes were compared with those obtained with conventional <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Randomized prospective studies are needed to explore the appropriate niche for the various different regimens...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Retrospective {{studies have}} shown similar {{survival}} among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) after nonmyeloablative compared with <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Refined risk stratification is required to design prospective trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We stratified outcomes among patients with AML (n = 391) or MDS (n = 186) who received either nonmyeloablative (n = 125) or myeloablative (n = 452) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) based on comorbidities, as assessed by a HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as well as disease status. Patients receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning were older, more frequently pretreated, more often received unrelated grafts, and more often had HCT-CI scores of 3 compared with patients who received <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning.</b> RESULTS: Patients with HCT-CI scores of 0 to 2 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival at 2 years of 70 % and 57 % after nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 78 % and 50 % after <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning,</b> respectively. Patients with HCT-CI scores of 3 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival of 41 % and 29 % with nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 45 % and 24 % with myeloablative regimens, respectively. After adjusting for pretransplantation differences, stratified outcomes {{were not significantly different}} among patients receiving nonmyeloablative compared with <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning,</b> with the exception of lessened nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio, 0. 50; P =. 05) in the highest risk group. CONCLUSION: Patients with low comorbidity scores could be candidates for prospective randomized trials comparing nonmyeloablative and <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regardless of disease status. Additional data are required for patients with low-risk diseases and high comorbidity scores. Novel antitumor agents combined with nonmyeloablative HCT should be explored among patients with high comorbidity scores and advanced disease. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the ongoing}} advent of more {{effective}} immunomodulators and proteasome inhibitors, multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable and no effective therapy {{is available for}} advanced aggressive disease. Although allogeneic (Allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has a curative potential, the outcomes remain poor because of high treatment-related mortality (TRM), mostly due to regimen-related toxicities and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in case of <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditionings,</b> high relapse rate in case of reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative regimens, and possibly other unknown MM-specific issues. In an attempt to improve TRM, without compromising conditioning intensity, we prospectively explored the feasibility and efficacy of a <b>myeloablative</b> but reduced-toxicity <b>conditioning</b> regimen, consisting of fludarabine and busulfan (FluBu 4; fludarabine 40  mg/m 2 /day and busulfan 3. 2  mg/kg/day i. v.  ×  4  days) in 22 patients with high-risk or advanced refractory MM. The majority (14 of 22, 64 %) had prior autologous HCT. The median HCT-specific comorbidity index score was 3 (range, 0 to 6), with 46 % having a Karnofsky performance score  3. With a median follow-up of 58. 7 (range, 39 to 82) months, the cumulative incidences of relapse at 1 and 3  years were 37 % (95 % CI, 20 % to 61 %) and 50 % (95 % CI, 29 % to 75 %); those for 1 -year and 3 -year overall survival (OS) were 58 % (95 % CI, 40 % to 83 %) and 29 % (95 % CI, 15 % to 57 %), respectively, and those for the 1 -year and 3 -year progression-free survivals (PFS) were 40 % (95 % CI, 23 % to 67 %) and 15 % (95 % CI, 5 % to 42 %), respectively. In summary, {{the use of the}} <b>myeloablative</b> FluBu 4 <b>conditioning</b> Allo-HCT for high-risk MM resulted in decreased TRM, compared with that of Allo-HCT using conventional myeloablative regimens; however, the relapse rate was high, including in those developing moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD. This suggested a less robust graft-versus-myeloma effect against high-risk MM, thus resulting in poor PFS and OS. Nonetheless, the FluBu 4 regimen may be used as a lower-TRM platform to combine with other strategies, eg, addition of an MM-targeted agent and/or maintenance therapy with these agents, to decrease relapse or progression in patients with high-risk MM...|$|R
40|$|High-dose {{melphalan}} with autologous {{stem cell}} rescue has {{been regarded as}} the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma up {{to the age of}} 65 - 70 years. The recent development of agents with potent anti-tumor activity such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib has further improved overall survival and response rates. However, relapse is a continuous risk.             Allografting is a potentially curative treatment for a subset of multiple myeloma patients for its well documented graft-vs-myeloma effects. However, its role has been hotly debated. Even though molecular remissions have been reported up to 50 % after high-dose <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditionings,</b> their applications, given the high toxicity, have been for long limited to younger relapsed/refractory patients. These limitations have greatly been reduced through the introduction of non-myeloablative/reduced-intensity conditionings.             The introduction of new drugs, characterised by low risks of early mortality, indeed requires to define role and timing of an allograft to capture the subset of patients who may most benefit from graft-vs-myeloma effects.    Ultimately, new drugs should not be viewed as mutually exclusive with an allograft. They may be employed to achieve profound cytoreduction before and enhance graft-versus-myeloma effects as consolidation/maintenance therapy after an allograft.

40|$|Defining {{conditioning}} regimen intensity {{has become}} a critical issue for the hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) community.

40|$|AbstractAllogeneic HCT after <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> is an {{effective}} therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies. In an attempt to extend this therapy to older patients or those with comorbidities, reduced intensity or truly nonmyeloablative regimens have been developed over the past decade. The principle underlying reduced intensity regimens is to provide some tumor kill with lessened regimen-related morbidity and mortality and then rely on graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects to eradicate remaining malignant cells, whereas nonmyeloablative regimens rely primarily on GVT effects. In this article, 3 representative approaches are described, demonstrating the clinical application for hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic malignancies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intestinal mucosal barrier injury (MBI), {{resulting}} from <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> for haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), {{is an important}} cause of morbidity. Despite its frequency, recognition presents a challenge, while the aetiology needs still to be unravelled. The relationship between enterocyte mass and enterocyte loss was explored by examining citrulline serum levels and by assessing circulating intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP), proteins released by dying mature enterocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients with haematological malignancy received allogeneic HSCT (HSCT day 0) 12 days after being given idarubicin, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation as <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning,</b> a regimen known to induce oral and intestinal MBI. Serum levels of citrulline, I-FABP and I-BABP were measured on HSCT days - 12, - 6, 0, + 7, + 14 and + 21. RESULTS: <b>Myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} serum citrulline with the nadir on HSCT day + 7; thereafter, levels rose gradually. Simultaneously, a significant decrease in I-FABP and I-BABP levels occurred from the day of transplant until day + 14. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous reduction and subsequent increase of citrulline and I-FABP and I-BABP levels following cytotoxic treatment show that enterocyte mass corresponds to lower rate of dying enterocytes, indicating reduced turnover of enterocytes.

Over the past few years, it has become more evident that the alloreactivty of transplanted donor immunocompetent cells against host tumor cells (graft-versus-tumor effects, GVT effects) {{plays a major role in}} eradicating malignancies after allogeneic HSCT. Based on these observations, several groups of investigators have developed reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allowing patients who are ineligible for conventional HSCT to benefit from the potentially curative GVT effects of allogeneic transplantation. Retrospective studies have suggested that, in comparison with myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, in patient aged 40 - 60 years, RIC HSCT was associated with a higher risk of relapse but a lower incidence of transplant-related mortality leading to similar progression-gree and overall survivals.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} 10 years, {{multiple}} studies using reduced-intensity (RI) conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) {{have been reported}} in adult and, less so, pediatric recipients. RI AlloSCT allegedly eradicates malignant cells through a graft-versus-leukemia/graft-versus-tumor effect provided by alloreactive donor T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, or both. Various studies have clearly demonstrated a graft-versus-leukemia/graft-versus-tumor effect in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Acute short-term toxicity, including infection and organ decompensation after <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> therapy, can result in a significant incidence of early transplant-related mortality. More importantly, long-term late effects—including growth retardation, infertility, and secondary malignancies—are major complications after <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> therapy, especially in vulnerable children, who are more susceptible to these complications. Recent results comparing RI conditioning with <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> followed by HLA-matched sibling AlloSCT have demonstrated a significant reduction in use of blood products, risk of infections, transplant-related mortality, length of hospitalization, and feasibility of conditioning therapy in outpatient settings.

Conditioning regimens {{were based on the}} combination of thiotepa, busulfan (Bu), cyclophospamide (Cy), or fludarabine (Flu), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Cumulative incidence of myeloid and platelet engraftment was 96 % and 73 % at a median time of 20 and 62 days, respectively. Engraftment was significantly faster for patients receiving higher doses of CD 34 + cells. Confidence Interval of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II-IV, III-IV, and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 26 %, 15 %, and 30 %, respectively. Leukemia-free survival (LFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse at 2 years were 42 %, 39 %, and 19 %, respectively. Low number of total nucleated cells (TNC) had a negative impact on NRM and LFS. Patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR 1) receiving TNC above 2 × 107 /kg had a 4 -year LFS of 75 %. These results show that CBT from unrelated donors is a curative treatment for a substantial number of patients with high-risk AML, particularly if transplant is performed with highly cellular units in patients in first CR...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPatients {{with class}} 3 {{thalassemia}} with high-risk features for adverse events after high-dose chemotherapy with {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) are difficult to treat, tending to either suffer serious toxicity or fail to establish stable graft function. We performed HSCT in 18 such patients age ≥ 7 years and hepatomegaly using a novel approach with pretransplant immunosuppression followed by a <b>myeloablative</b> reduced-toxicity <b>conditioning</b> regimen (fludarabine and i. v. busulfan [Flu-IV Bu]) and then HSCT. The median patient age was 14 years (range, 10 to 18 years). Before the Flu-IV Bu + antithymocyte globulin conditioning regimen, all patients received 1 to 2 cycles of pretransplant immunosuppression with fludarabine and dexamethasone. Thirteen patients received a related donor graft, and 5 received an unrelated donor graft. An initial prompt engraftment of donor cells with full donor chimerism was observed in all 18 patients, but 2 patients developed secondary mixed chimerism that necessitated withdrawal of immunosuppression to achieve full donor chimerism. Two patients (11 %) had acute grade III-IV graft-versus-host disease, and 5 patients had limited chronic graft-versus-host disease. The only treatment-related mortality was from infection, and with a median follow-up of 42 months (range, 4 to 75), the 5 -year overall survival and thalassemia-free survival were 89 %. We conclude that this novel sequential immunoablative pretransplantation conditioning program is safe and effective for patients with high-risk class 3 thalassemia exhibiting additional comorbidities...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective study of 155 children who underwent unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) between 1990 and 2005 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in third remission. The median patient age was 11 years, the median time from diagnosis to first relapse was 36 months, and the median time from first relapse to second relapse was 26 months. Stem cell sources were bone marrow (n = 115), peripheral blood (n = 11), and cord blood (n = 29). All patients received a <b>myeloablative</b> pretransplantation <b>conditioning</b> regimen. The 5 -year estimates of leukemia-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were 30 %, 25 %, and 45 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the only risk factor associated with relapse was {{the interval between}} the first relapse and the second relapse. Second relapses occurring > 26 months from the first relapse were associated with lower risk for post-HCT relapse compared with second relapses occurring at ≤ 26 months (relative risk, 0. 4; P =. 01). Relapse risk was lowest when late second relapse was preceded by late first relapse (> 36 months from diagnosis), as demonstrated by a 3 -year relapse rate of 9 % (P =. 0009). Our data indicate that long-term leukemia-free survival can be achieved in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in third remission using unrelated donor HCT, especially when the second relapse occurs late...|$|R
40|$|Background: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is {{currently}} {{used to treat}} acute and chronic graft-versus disease not-responsive to conventional therapy. ECP {{is believed to have}} an immunomodulatory effect and may do so by modulating DC function and induction of regulatory T cells (Treg). A significant delay in the time to onset of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has recently been reported for adult patients receiving preventive ECP, performed prior to <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen. The use of preventive ECP in pediatrics has so far not been addressed. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preventive of ECP performed before a <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen in pediatrics. Methods: Eleven pediatric patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant were treated with conventional <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> (n= 8) or in addition with prophylactic ECP performed on two successive days before starting myeloablation (n= 3) and followed up until d 100. The control group (n= 8) included five transplants from matched unrelated donors and three from sibling donors, while the treatment group (n= 3) included two transplants from matched unrelated donors and one from sibling donor. Regulatory T cell frequency was estimated by FACS analysis before conditioning and, for ECP treated patients, before performing ECP, too. Results: Preventive ECP significantly reduced the incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV. While all patients in the control group developed acute GVHD grade II-IV, only two out of three treated patients experienced acute GvHD grade II-IV (p= 0. 04338). No adverse effects were observed following preventive ECP. The relative size of Treg was increased after the second day of ECP in one sample with low size before treatment, while in two samples with higher basic frequency, Treg did not further increase. Conclusion: Extracorporeal photopheresis incorporated in the <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen was not associated with major adverse effects. A statistically significant reduction of the incidence of acute GVHD was observed. Albeit definitive conclusions cannot be drawn owing to the low size of the cohort, the preliminary results encourage to investigate the usefulness of preventive ECP as a remedy to reduce the incidence and/or severity of acute GvHD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReduced-intensity {{conditioning}} (RIC) regimens {{have been}} increasingly used for allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) in follicular lymphoma (FL). We compared traditional <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimens to RIC in FL. Outcomes of HLA-identical sibling HSCT for FL in 208 recipients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Conditioning regimens were categorized as myeloablative (N = 120) or RIC (N = 88). Use of RIC regimens increased from 80 % in 2002 signaling {{a major shift in}} practice. Patients receiving RIC were older and had a longer interval from diagnosis to transplant. These differences did not correlate with outcomes. Median follow-up of survivors was 50 months (4 - 96 months) after <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> versus 35 months (4 - 82 months) after RIC (P <. 001). At 3 years, overall survival (OS) for the myeloablative and RIC cohorts were 71 (63 %- 79 %) and 62 (51 %- 72 %; P =. 15) and progression free survival (PFS), 67 (58 %- 75 %) and 55 (44 %- 65 %; P =. 07), respectively. Lower Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and resistance to chemotherapy were associated with higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) and lower OS and PFS. On multivariate analysis, an increased risk of lymphoma progression after RIC was observed (relative risk = 2. 97, P =. 04). RIC has become the de facto standard in allogeneic HSCT for FL, and appears to result in similar long-term outcomes. Although disease-free survival (DPS) is similar compared to <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning,</b> an increased risk of late disease progression after RIC is concerning...|$|E
40|$|We report {{long-term}} results after {{a median}} follow-up of 105 months in 18 patients with multiple myeloma who received an intensified <b>myeloablative</b> <b>conditioning</b> regimen regimen consisting of modified total body irradiation, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease occurred in 7 patients (44 %), and treatment-related mortality was 17 %. Complete remission (CR) with negative immunofixation after allogeneic SCT occurred in 53 % of the patients. For all patients, the estimated overall survival at 12 years was 50 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 26 %- 74 %), and the estimated event-free survival (EFS) was 35 % (95 % CI, 23 %- 57 %).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) might be a better treatment option, compared to drug therapy, for young patients with high-/intermediate-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF). However, there are no controlled studies that validate this contention and allo-SCT is associated with a substantial risk of procedure-related mortality and morbidity. In a retrospective analysis of nontransplant PMF patients, who were both young (age < 60 years) and with high-/intermediate-risk disease, 1 - and 3 -year survival estimates were 87 % and 55 %, 95 % and 77 %, 71 % and 58 %, respectively, involving patients seen at three different centers with expertise in PMF; these data {{did not appear to be}} inferior to those published in the context of either <b>myeloablative</b> or reduced-intensity <b>conditioning</b> allo-SCT.

40|$|International audienceAllogeneic {{hematopoietic cell}} {{transplantation}} (HCT) is curative for selected patients with advanced essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV). From 1990 to 2007, 75 patients with ET (median age 49 years) and 42 patients with PV (median age 53 years) underwent transplantations at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC; n = 43) or at other Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) centers (n = 74). Thirty-eight {{percent of the}} patients had splenomegaly and 28 % had a prior splenectomy. Most patients (69 % for ET and 67 % for PV) received a <b>myeloablative</b> (MA) <b>conditioning</b> regimen. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at 28 days was 88 % for ET patients and 90 % for PV patients. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grades II to IV occurred in 57 % and 50 % of ET and PV patients, respectively. The 1 -year treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 27 % for ET and 22 % for PV. The 5 -year cumulative incidence of relapse was 13 % for ET and 30 % for PV. Five-year survival/progression-free survival (PFS) was 55 %/ 47 % and 71 %/ 48 % for ET and PV, respectively. Patients without splenomegaly had faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment, but there were no differences in TRM, survival, or PFS. Presence of myelofibrosis (MF) did not affect engraftment or TRM.

40|$|The optimal {{pretransplant}} regimen for acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients ≥ 55 years of age remains to be determined. The myeloablative reduced-toxicity 4 -day regimen i. v. busulfan (Bu) (130 mg/m 2) and i. v. fludarabine (Flu) (40 mg/m 2) is associated with low morbidity and mortality. We analyzed 79 patients ≥ 55 years of age (median, 58 years) with AML (n = 63) or MDS (n = 16) treated with i. v. Bu-Flu conditioning regimens between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up, 24 months). The patients who received this regimen had a good performance status. The 2 -year overall survival (OS) rates for patients in first complete remission (CR 1), second CR (CR 2), or refractory disease and for all patients at time of transplantation were 71 %, 44 %, 32 %, and 46 %, respectively; 2 -year event-free survival (EFS) rates for patients in CR 1, CR 2, or refractory disease at time of transplantation and for all patients were 68 %, 42 %, 30 %, and 44 %, respectively. One-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates for patients who were in CR or who had active disease {{at the time of}} transplantation were 19 % and 20 %, respectively.
