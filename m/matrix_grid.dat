40|$|Any {{endeavour}} {{to accurately}} model flow through fractured porous media at the field-scale must overcome two important challenges. First, the discretized {{representation of the}} medium needs to accommodate the complex geometry of intersecting small-scale fractures with various lengths, apertures and orientations. Second, the model formulation must ensure that the conductivity of these fractures, which can be orders of magnitude higher or {{lower than that of}} the host rock, is properly taken into account when computing the pressure map. The Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) is well known in the literature for its flexibility in representing fractures. More specifically, in EDFM, fractures are lower-dimensional features, discretized independently from the matrix. Their effect on the flow is captured by defining fluxes between the fracture control volumes and the <b>matrix</b> <b>grid</b> cells they intersect. EDFM was proven effective in capturing the flow behaviour through porous media containing highly conductive fractures. However, its formulation fails to represent the effect of low-permeable features, such as embedded flow barriers. In this work, a novel projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM) is introduced for flow simulation in fractured porous media with general conductivity contrasts. Similar to EDFM, pEDFM constructs independent grids for the fracture and matrix domains. As an additional step, the transmissibilities at matrix interfaces are automatically adjusted to account for the conductivity of neighbouring fracture networks, via a scaling factor proportional to their geometric projections. The performance of pEDFM is investigated extensively for two- and three-dimensional scenarios involving single- as well as multiphase flows. These numerical experiments are targeted at determining the sensitivity of the model towards the grid resolution, fracture position and orientation, as well as the conductivity contrast towards the matrix. The results of these studies support the conclusion that pEDFM significantly outperforms the original EDFM model and is a viable method for field-scale simulation of flow in naturally fractured reservoirs.

The purpose {{of this research was}} to explore the effectiveness of social messaging in a multimedia recruitment tool designed for secondary school learners being recruited at a technikon in the greater Cape Town area. The proposed research was not designed to evaluate current recruitment methods, but rather to investigate the potential of an altemative method to recruit both the traditional and nontraditional student at a tertiary institution. A sample of five schools in the Cape Town Metropolitan area were used for this study. These schools represented a cultural and academic mix, looking at learners from both advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. The method used for this research was firstly a presentation of the CD-ROM at the Media Laboratory in the then School of Management, Cape Technikon, which was followed by focus group interviews two weeks later at the same schools. An interactive CD-ROM - The Cape Technikon - Tools to empower your future was created to recruit a multicultural student population, but more specifically to recruit the traditional and nontraditional student to the Cape Technikon.

The intent of the research was to provide a pattern of alternative insights that could provide a more meaningful method of evaluation for visual learners in an art education setting. Visual methods of learning are indeed complex and involve the interplay of many sensory modalities of input. Using a qualitative method of research analysis, a series of queries were proposed into a structured <b>matrix</b> <b>grid</b> for seeking out possible and emerging patterns of learning. The grid provided for interrelated visual and linguistic analysis with emphasis in reflection and interconnectedness. Sensory-based modes of learning are currently being studied and discussed amongst educators as alternative approaches to learning.

One focus is on the geometrical difficulties that may arise in realistic simulations such as intersecting and immersed fractures. Another important aspect is the choice of the approximation spaces for the discrete problem: in mixed formulations, both the Darcy velocity and the pressure are considered as unknowns, while in classical primal formulations, a richer space for the pressure is considered and the Darcy velocity is computed a posteriori. In both cases, the extended finite element method is used, which allows for a complete geometrical decoupling among the fractures and rock <b>matrix</b> <b>grids.</b> The fracture geometries can thus be independent of the underlying grid thanks to suitable enrichments of the spaces that are able to represent possible jumps of the solution across the fractures.

By introducing fine grain power controls, sections of the design that have excess timing margins are able to run at reduced voltage thereby saving power. Delay critical sections can continue to operate at full voltage to maintain the overall performance of the design.

40|$|Naturally {{fractured}} reservoirs (NFRs) {{account for}} a large fraction of the world water and energy resources. The geological complexity and high permeability contrast of naturally fractured reser- voirs make it very challenging to accurately predict flow trough these reservoirs. Simulating flow through fractured porous media has been a research topic for several decades. The simulators are becoming increasingly powerful and efficient. However, accurate simulations of flow through real field NFRs examples still su?er from limited CPU capacity. Such accurate and efficient models and simulation techniques for flow through fractured porous media are crucial to optimize reservoir management strategies, e. g., in terms of ultimate recovery and NPV for hydrocarbon reserves. The embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM), in which fractures are represented explicitly and coupled to the matrix through a transfer function, leads to accurate solutions with much lower computational costs compared with alternative discrete fracture network models. However, NFRs are geologically too complex to be fully represented in an EDFM, because of limited computational capacity. Therefore, a hierarchical model is utilized which combines the EDFM with fracture upscaling. In the HFM small and medium scale fractures are upscaled into an e?ective matrix rock permeability while large-scale fractures are explicitly represented by the EDFM. Though the basic idea of EDFM has been developed and evolved during the last decade, its application to realistic fields involves answering several concerns mainly related to determination of the scale which {{is the basis of}} splitting the homogenized and explicit fractures. For the homogenized fractures, in addition, a method which is efficient (specially when dynamic properties are upscaled, such as relative permeabilities) and accurate (e. g., flow-based upscaling or analytical approaches) need to be explored. A hierarchical fracture modeling approach in the EDFM framework (and other discrete- fracture-network models) is applicable only when these concerns are considered. Unfortunately the EDFM literature does not involve any systematic study addressing these important concerns. As such, this thesis work is dedicated to address them. In {{the first part of this}} work the grid sensitivity of the EDFM is studied for both single and multiphase flow. The EDFM showed to be sensitive for matrix and fracture grid orientation as well as the relative grid size resolution. These issues are resolved on a fine grid. The solution’s accuracy showed to be dominated by the <b>matrix</b> <b>grid</b> resolution. The second part consists of a study of di?erent fracture upscale criteria in the HFM framework.

40|$|Accurate {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} multiphase flow in fractured porous media require high resolution grids to explicitly capture {{the effect of}} fractures on the flow field without using excessively up-scaled quantities (e. g., modified rock permeabilities). For field-scale applications, as the consequence of large-scale domains and many explicit fractures, {{the size of the}} (non) linear systems becomes out of the scope of the classical numerical methods. Thus, various advanced numerical methods have been introduced to reduce this computational challenge. The Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) which employs sets of independent grids for the rock matrix and the fractures (represented as lower dimensional domains). By employing two separate grids, coupled by a transfer function, EDFM allows to avoid adapting the <b>matrix</b> <b>grid</b> to accommodate the presence of fractures. Therefore, computational complexities with respect to the fracture geometries are significantly reduced. Even after employing EDFM, the size of the systems for real-field applications is still too large to be solved accurately with classical solvers. This challenge motivates the development of Multiscale Finite Volume (MSFV) method, which is the focus of this work, as well. The MSFV method efficiently solves the pressure (flow) equations by solving it at a coarser resolution, while honoring the fine-scale heterogeneous data. Recently, an efficient MSFV method for EDFM approach (F-AMS) was developed and tested for many cases of practical interests. Even though the F-AMS was found efficient for many scenarios, its applicability is limited to only the use of 2 levels of grids (fine and coarse). For real-field applications, where there exist several millions (or billions) degrees of freedom, the construction of only 1 level of coarse grid resolution may not be sufficient. Of high interest to the community is the development of a multiscale method which allows for arbitrary number of accurate coarse resolutions. In this work, {{for the first time in}} the multiscale community, a novel multilevel multiscale finite volume method for fractured porous media (F-MLMS) is developed. F-MLMS is successfully applied to a set of synthetic 2 D test cases and its performance is carefully studied. Employing a multilevel strategy becomes crucial for field-scale applications, where a single level of coarsening is not enough to reduce significantly the size of the linear systems to be solved. The use of two independent grids allows to employ different coarsening strategies for the two media. Consequently, F-MLMS represents an important step forward for the application of multiscale methods to naturally and induced fractured reservoirs, with complex fracture networks.

40|$|A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is {{a system}} to {{communicate}} with external world through the brain activity. The brain activity is measured by Electro-Encephalography (EEG) and then processed by a BCI system. EEG source reconstruction could {{be a way to}} improve the accuracy of EEG classification in EEGbased brain–computer interface (BCI). In this thesis BCI methods were applied on derived sources which by their EEG enhancement it became possible to obtain a more accurate EEG detection and brought a new application to BCI technology that are recognition of writing letters imagery from brain waves. The BCI system enables people to write and type letters by their brain activity (EEG). To this end, first part of the thesis is dedicated to EEG source reconstruction techniques to select the most optimal EEG channels for task classification purposes. Due to this reason the changes in EEG signal power from rest state to motor imagery task was used, to find the location of an active single equivalent dipole. Implementing an inverse problem solution on the power changes by Multiple Sparse Priors (MSP) method generated a scalp map where its fitting showed the localization of EEG electrodes. Having the optimized locations the secondary objective was to choose the most optimal EEG features and rhythm for an efficient classification. This became possible by feature ranking, 1 - Nearest Neighbor leave-one-out. The feature vectors were computed by applying the combined methods of multitaper method, Pwelch. The features were classified by several methods of Normal densities based quadratic classifier (qdc), k-nearest neighbor classifier (knn), Mixture of Gaussians classification and Train neural network classifier using back-propagation. Results show that the selected features and classifiers are able to recognize the imagination of writing alphabet with the high accuracy. BCI controls external devices and interacts with the environment by brain signals. Measured EEG signals over the motor cortex exhibit changes in power related to the movements or imaginations which are executed in motor tasks [1]. These changes declare increase or decrease of power in the alpha (8 Hz- 13 Hz), and beta (13 Hz- 28 Hz) frequency bands from resting state to motor imagery task that known as event related synchronization (in case of power increasing) and desynchronization (in case of power decreasing) [2]. The necessity to communicate with the external world for locked-in state (LIS) patients (a paralyzed patient who only communicates with eyes), made doctors and engineers motivated to develop a BCI technology for typing letters through brain commands. Many researches have been done around this area to ascertain the dream of typing for handicapped. In the brain some regions of the cerebral cortex (motor cortex) are involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are electrical potential generated by the nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. In order to execute motoric tasks, the EEG signals are appeared over the motor cortex [1]. The measured brain response to a stimulus is called eventrelated potential (ERP). P 300 -event related potential (ERP) is an evoked neuron response to an external auditory or visual stimulus that is detectable in scalp-recorded EEG (The P 300 is evoked potential which occurs across the parieto-central on the skull 300 ms after applying the stimulus). Farwell and Donchin have proven in a P 300 -based BCI speller [3] that P 300 response is a reliable signal for controlling a BCI system. They described the P 300 speller, in which alphanumeric characters are represented in a <b>matrix</b> <b>grid</b> of six-by-six matrix. The user should focus on one of the 36 character cells while each row and column of the grid is intensified randomly and sequentially. The P 300, observed in EEG signals, is created by the intersection of the target row and column which causes detection of the target stimuli with a probability of 1 / 6 (in case of high accuracy of flashing operation). Also when the target stimulus is rarely presented in the random sequence of stimuli causes a neural reaction to unpredictable but recognizable event and a P 300 response is evoked [3]. Generally when the subject is involved with the task to recognize the targets, the P 300 wave happens and the signal amplitude varies with the unlikelihood of the targets. Its dormancy changes with the difficulty of recognizing the target stimulus from the standard stimuli [3]. The attended character of the matrix can be extracted by proper feature extraction and classification of P 300. A plenty of procedures for feature extraction and classification have been applied to improve the performance of originally reported speller [3], such as stepwise linear discriminate analysis (SWLDA) [4, 5], wavelets [1], support vector machines [6, 7, 8] and matched filtering [9]. Till now, BCI-related P 300 research has mostly considered on signals from standard P 300 scalp locations. While in [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] it has been proven that the use of additional locations, especially posterior sites, may improve classification accuracy, but it has not been addressed to particular offline and online studies. Recently, auditory version improvement of the visual P 300 speller allows locked in patients who have problem in the visual system to use the P 300 speller system by relating two numbers to each letter which indicate the row and column of letter position [17]. Now a new technology is needed which can substitute a keyboard with no alphabet menu. The technology will be handy for blind people and useful for healthy persons who need to work hands free with their computer or mobile. The aim of this thesis is to improve EEG detection through source localization for a new BCI application to type with EEG signals without using alphabet menu. + 98 - 935957622...|$|E

Aiming at {{addressing}} the problem of optimal allocation of grid resource, a stochastic dynamics model is proposed to research evolutionary game of resource allocation in finite grid population in this paper. The focal point of this model is using a Moran process with frequency dependent selection to find the condition for selection favoring the invasion index and fixation index of gird user’s strategy during the repeated game. Then, according to the characteristics of economic grid, we establish a fixed utility <b>matrix</b> of <b>grid</b> users to quantify the strategy selection dynamics. The numerical experiments show that the strategy of individuals will develop towards different directions under different grid population size for maximizing its own utility...|$|R
