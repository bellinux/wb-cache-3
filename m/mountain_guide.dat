5|$|The first {{exporter}} of palm seeds was Ned King, a <b>mountain</b> <b>guide</b> for the Fitzgerald surveys of 1869 and 1876, who sent seed to the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Overseas trade {{began in the}} 1880s when {{it was found that}} one of the four palms endemic to the island, kentia palm (Howea forsteriana), which grows naturally in the lowlands, was ideally suited to the fashionable conservatories of the well-to-do in Britain, Europe and the United States, but the assistance of mainland magistrate Frank Farnell was needed to put the business on a sound commercial footing when in 1906 he became Director of a company, the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery, whose shareholders included 21 islanders and a Sydney-based seed company. However, the formation of the Lord Howe Island Board of Control was needed in 1913 to resolve outstanding issues.|$|E

Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.|$|E

25|$|Brede Arkless (née Boyle) (10 August 1939 – 18 March 2006) was a British female climber and mountaineer, and was {{actively}} involved in the all-women's climbing movement.

She made several all-women trips to the greater ranges, while still being able to rear eight children. She also organised women-only climbing courses, together with the noted climber and feminist Jill Lawrence. She was only the second woman to qualify, in the 1960s, as a British <b>Mountain</b> <b>Guide,</b> and was the first woman to hold the badge of the UIAGM as an international <b>mountain</b> <b>guide.</b> Increasingly involved in all-women climbing and guiding, she eventually separated from her husband, moved to New Zealand in September 1990 and became a New Zealand citizen in 1995.

25|$|On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier {{set off for}} the Zugspitzplatt and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they {{attempted}} to reach the West Summit along the west ridge.

A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August {{they returned to the}} shepherd's hut at about 3 in the morning.

One {{of the best known}} ridge routes in the Eastern Alps runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (Jubiläumsgrat) to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the Hochblassen and the Alpspitze. For mountaineers there is plenty of nearby accommodation. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the Münchner Haus and on the western slopes is the Wiener-Neustädter Hut.|$|E

25|$|In 1823, Simon Resch and {{the sheep}} Toni {{became the first}} to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>guide,</b> Johann Barth. Because Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed {{for a third time}} by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a {{flagpole}} on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's Crown Princess Marie. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze.|$|E
