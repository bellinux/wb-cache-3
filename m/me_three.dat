25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken <b>me</b> <b>three</b> weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
500|$|Opponents {{continued}} to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates. [...] Talk radio hammered on this, with New York-based Sean Hannity issuing a daily mantra, [...] "Name <b>me</b> <b>three</b> things Hillary Clinton has ever done {{for the people of}} New York!" [...] Clinton's supporters pointed out that the state was receptive to national leaders, such as Robert F. Kennedy who was elected to the Senate in 1964 despite similar accusations. In the end, according to exit polls conducted in the race, a majority of the voters dismissed the carpetbagging issue as unimportant.|$|E

[...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there.

She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took <b>me</b> <b>three</b> years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E
500|$|On January 21, 2016, Microsoft was sued {{in small}} claims court by a user whose computer, shortly {{after the release of}} the OS, had {{attempted}} to upgrade to Windows10 without her consent. The upgrade failed, and her computer was left in an unstable state thereafter, which disrupted the ability to run her travel agency. The court ruled in favor of the user and awarded her $10,000 in damages, but Microsoft appealed. However, in May 2016, Microsoft dropped the appeal and chose to pay the damages. Shortly after the suit was reported on by the Seattle Times, Microsoft confirmed that it was updating the GWX software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free Windows 10 upgrade; the final notification was a full-screen pop-up window notifying users of the impending end of the free upgrade offer, and contained [...] "Remind me later", [...] "Do not notify me again" [...] and [...] "Notify <b>me</b> <b>three</b> more times" [...] options.|$|E

So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken <b>me</b> <b>three,</b> four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

500|$|García Márquez {{began his}} career as a {{journalist}} while studying law at the National University of Colombia. In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for El Universal in Cartagena. Later, from 1950 until 1952, he wrote a [...] "whimsical" [...] column under the name of [...] "Septimus" [...] for the local paper El Heraldo in Barranquilla. García Márquez noted of his time at El Heraldo, [...] "I'd write a piece and they'd pay <b>me</b> <b>three</b> pesos for it, and maybe an editorial for another three." [...] During this time he became an active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the Barranquilla Group, an association that provided great motivation and inspiration for his literary career. He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon Vinyes, whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude. At this time, García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner. Faulkner's narrative techniques, historical themes and use of rural locations influenced many Latin American authors. The environment of Barranquilla gave García Márquez a world-class literary education and provided him with a unique perspective on Caribbean culture. From 1954 to 1955, García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote for Bogotá's El Espectador. He was a regular film critic which drove his interest in film.|$|E
500|$|Bleed Like Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair rated the album a B+, complimenting the [...] "humongous hooks", and Kerrang! gave Bleed Like Me 4 out of 5, describing {{it as the}} [...] "most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they’ve put out in years". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, writing that [...] "the first two-thirds of Bleed Like Me is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut", but that the final tracks had [...] "a samenessa feeling of roaring in circles". Sal Cinquemani of Slant also awarded it three and a half stars out of five; he praised the new sound and wrote that [...] "a few of the songs ("Run Baby Run" [...] and [...] "Right Between the Eyes" [...] in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group's first two releases". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Bleed Like <b>Me</b> <b>three</b> stars out of five, writing that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach [...] "as if the band doesn't quite know how to do anything else but sound like it's the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock." [...] This opinion was shared by Yahoo! Music's Sharon O’Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in [...] "muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook", Bleed Like Me [...] "strikes a depressingly dated note".|$|E

We were flat broke, and that's happened to <b>me</b> <b>three</b> times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E

The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants." [...] At the time, [...] "the pill" [...] was legally unavailable in Canada, as was abortion, yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock. In Toronto, she could at least do so quietly, without alarming her relatives back home. In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, she placed her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, for example [...] "Little Green", which she performed in the 1960s and eventually recorded for the 1971 album Blue.|$|E
