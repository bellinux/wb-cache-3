25|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of tantalum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} structure of the anode and the electrolyte used.

25|$|Above {{approximately}} 1 <b>microfarad</b> {{electrolytic capacitors}} are usually used {{because of their}} small size and low cost compared with other types, unless their relatively poor stability, life and polarised nature make them unsuitable.

50|$|The {{component}} {{value for}} the inductor can be estimated as an inductance that resonates the smoothing capacitor(s) at or below one tenth of the minimum AC frequency in the power supplied to the filter (100 Hz from a full-wave rectifier {{in a region where}} the power supply is 50Hz). Thus if reservoir and smoothing capacitors of 2200 <b>microfarads</b> are used, a suitable minimum {{value for the}} inductor would be that which resonates 2200 <b>microfarads</b> (μF) to 10 Hz, i.e. 115 mH. A larger value is preferable provided the inductor can carry the required supply current.|$|R

2500|$|The decibel {{originates}} from {{methods used}} to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally Miles of Standard Cable (MSC). 1MSC corresponded {{to the loss of}} power over a 1 mile (approximately 1.6km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000 radians per second (795.8Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was [...] "a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 ohms per loop mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054 <b>microfarad</b> per mile" [...] (approximately 19 gauge).|$|E
60|$|The {{original}} {{determination of}} the <b>microfarad,</b> brought out {{under the auspices of}} the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards, is due to experimental work by Jenkin, described in a paper, 'Experiments on Capacity,' constituting No. IV. of the appendix to the Report presented by the Committee to the Dundee Meeting of 1867. No other determination, so far as I know, of this important element of electric measurement has hitherto been made; and it is no small thing to be proud of in respect to Jenkin's fame as a scientific and practical electrician that the <b>microfarad</b> which we now all use is his.|$|E
5000|$|The {{picofarad}} {{is sometimes}} colloquially pronounced as [...] "puff" [...] or [...] "pic", as in [...] "a ten-puff capacitor". Similarly, [...] "mic" [...] (pronounced [...] "mike") is sometimes used informally to signify <b>microfarads.</b> If the Greek letter μ is not available, the notation [...] "uF" [...] {{is often used}} {{as a substitute for}} [...] "μF" [...] in electronics literature. A [...] "micro-microfarad" [...] (μμF, and confusingly often mmf or MMF), an obsolete unit sometimes found in older texts, is the equivalent of a picofarad. In texts prior to 1960, and on capacitor packages even much more recently, [...] "mf" [...] or [...] "MFD" [...] rather than the modern [...] "µF" [...] frequently represented <b>microfarads.</b> Similarly, [...] "mmf" [...] or [...] "MMFD" [...] represented picofarads.|$|R

50|$|Many DVMs (digital volt meters) have a capacitance-measuring function. These usually operate by {{charging}} and discharging the capacitor under test with a known current and measuring {{the rate of}} rise of the resulting voltage; the slower the rate of rise, the larger the capacitance. DVMs can usually measure capacitance from nanofarads to a few hundred <b>microfarads,</b> but wider ranges are not unusual.|$|R
5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of {{the majority}} of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the farad. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the <b>microfarad</b> (µF), nanofarad (nF), picofarad (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). However, specially made supercapacitors can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; [...] "mfd" [...] and [...] "mf" [...] for <b>microfarad</b> (µF); [...] "mmfd", [...] "mmf", [...] "µµF" [...] for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacitance}} {{range for}} tantalum capacitors spans from singular <b>microfarads</b> (uFd) through a thousand <b>microfarads.</b> It is an electrolytic type of capacitor that can utilize either a liquid type of electrolyte or a solid state material as the cathode connection. The anode construction utilizes the high porosity of the pressed tantalum material {{to create an}} enormous amount of surface area to produce the highest volumetric efficiency of any of the commercial capacitors available. In the solid state devices, these can be readily packaged in a molded plastic package that yields a mechanically consistent surface mount package for high speed automated board processes. Circuitry that utilizes some of the newer switch mode power supply designs (SMPS), requires capacitance values for their filter circuits that lie well within the capacitance range of tantalum capacitors. With the volumetric efficiency, capacitance range and surface mount packaging, the tantalum capacitor has become a standard device for this application. Tantalum History in Power Applications The history of these capacitors in this application is not entirely without failures. Early versions of the surface mount devices were not intended fo...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft {{with a thin}} {{dielectric}} coating on the outer surface of the structure which are biased (- 200 V) negative relative to the atmospheric plasma are susceptible to dielectric breakdown. This paper will present experimental tests designed to measure the electron current flow from the structure through the plasma during the arc. The current path was examined in three parts: the electrons supplied through the structure and the arc to the outer structure, {{the expansion of the}} arc into the ambient plasma, and the return current through the ambient plasma. The measured electron current either flowing from the plasma or supplied to the plasma by the arc in each case was compared to the random thermal electron current which could be collected. The results of the tests show a spacecraft is capable of supporting arcs with peak currents greater than thermal electron currents, and these currents will be dependent upon the amount of stored charge in the structure (i. e., the structure's surface area and dielectric thickness). Also, the results of these tests show that it is possible for structures with a self capacitance of 10 <b>microFarads</b> to see peak currents of 90 A and structures with 1000 <b>microFarads</b> (i. e., capacitance of one Space Station Freedom module) to produce peak currents of 1000 A...|$|R
25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 <b>microfarads</b> and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|R
