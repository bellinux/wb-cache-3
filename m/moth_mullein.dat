5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (<b>moth</b> <b>mullein),</b> after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E
50|$|Though {{having a}} wide range of habitats, the mullein is {{typically}} found in open fields such as pastures and meadows. It can also found in open woods. The <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> prefers rich soils, but is tolerant of dry, sandy, and even gravelly soils.|$|E
50|$|V. blattaria is more {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>moth</b> <b>mullein,</b> so named because of the resemblance of its flowers' stamen to a moth’s antennae. This is {{not to be confused with}} the more popular and widely known common mullein (V. thapsus), a close relative of V. blattaria.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mullein</b> <b>moth,</b> (Cucullia verbasci), is a noctuid moth with a Palearctic distribution.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mullein</b> <b>moth,</b> {{a species}} in the order Lepidoptera which feeds on Verbascum and other plants.|$|R
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the <b>mullein</b> <b>moth</b> (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|R
50|$|Verbascum blattaria, or <b>moth</b> <b>mullein,</b> is a {{flowering}} biennial weed {{belonging to}} the Scrophulariaceae (figwort) family. An invasive species native to Eurasia and North Africa, it has naturalized in the United States and most of Canada since its introduction. It has been declared a noxious weed {{by the state of}} Colorado.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Europe, Asia, and North Africa, the <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> has {{naturalized}} {{in most of}} North America since its introduction. It was first recorded in Pennsylvania in 1818, and was recorded in Michigan in 1840. It has since been found in {{almost every one of}} the continental United States, as well as in southern Canada and even Hawaii. In the United States, it is found most abundantly along the East Coast.|$|E
50|$|Even in folk medicine, V. blattaria has {{not been}} {{attributed}} {{to a wide range}} of uses. However, a study conducted in 1974 reported that when a number of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae were exposed to a methanol extract of <b>moth</b> <b>mullein,</b> at least 53% of the larvae were killed. V. blattaria has also long been known to be an effective cockroach repellent, and the name blattaria is actually derived from the Latin word for cockroach, blatta.|$|E
50|$|One of the longest-running soil seed {{viability}} trials {{was started in}} Michigan in 1879 by James Beal. The experiment involved the burying of 20 bottles holding 50 seeds from 21 species. Every five years, a bottle from every species was retrieved and germinated on a tray of sterilized soil which was kept in a growth chamber. Later, after responsibility for managing the experiment was delegated to caretakers, the period between retrievals became longer. In 1980, more than 100 years after the trial was started, seeds of only three species were observed to germinate: <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum blattaria), common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) and common mallow (Malva neglecta).|$|E
50|$|The <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> is a {{biennial}} plant. In {{its first}} year of growth, its leaves develop as a basal rosette. During this first year, the stem of the plant remains extremely short. The leaves of the rosette are oblanceolate with deeply toothed edges and {{are attached to the}} stem by short petioles. The rosette can grow to a diameter of 16 in (40 cm) during this first year, with each individual leaf reaching a length up to 8 in. The mullein forms a fibrous root system with a deep taproot. In the second year of growth, the stem of the mullein grows slender and erect, and can reach a height of 2 to 5 ft. This length of stem is commonly referred to as the flowering stem. It usually grows unbranched, and leaves grow alternatively directly off the stem. The leaves located on the flowering stem are similar to the leaves of the rosette; however, they tend to be smaller and elliptical with shallow-toothed edges and have sharply pointed tips. Theses leaves can reach a length of 5 in. Both the leaves of the rosette and the leaves of the flowering stem are dark green in color and glabrous (hairless). The flowers of the <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> are produced during the second year of growth, and are found in loose clusters {{near the top of the}} flowering stem. Each flower is attached individually to the flowering stem by a pedicel. Each pedicel typically reaches a length less than 1 in. The flowers of the mullein consist of five petals and five anther-bearing stamens, and each flower can reach a diameter of 1 in (25 mm). The flowers can be either yellow or white and typically have a slight purple tinge. The stamens of the flower are orange in color and are covered in purple hairs, reminiscent to a moth’s antennae. The flowers of the mullein bloom between June and October of the second year. The <b>moth</b> <b>mullein</b> grows a small, simple fruit that is spherical in shape and has a diameter less than 0.5 in. Each fruit is dark brown in color and contains numerous dark brown seeds. The fruit capsule splits in two and falls to the ground when mature. Each plant produces over 1,000 fruit capsules. The fruit of the mullein develops, matures, and falls from the plant all in the second year of growth. In certain regions of the world, finches have been known to consume and distribute the seeds.|$|E
