50|$|To first order, the {{resistance}} of a wire on an integrated circuit is directly proportional, or linear, according to the wire's length. If a 1 <b>mm</b> <b>length</b> of the wire has 100 ohms resistance, then a 2 <b>mm</b> <b>length</b> will have 200 ohms resistance.|$|E
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of our highly simplified discussion, the capacitance of a wire also increases linearly along its length. If a 1 <b>mm</b> <b>length</b> of the wire has 0.01 µF capacitance, a 2 <b>mm</b> <b>length</b> of the wire will have 0.02 µF, a 3 mm wire will have 0.03 µF, and so on.|$|E
