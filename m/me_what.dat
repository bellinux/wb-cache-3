5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed <b>me</b> <b>what</b> an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|Yeah Yeah Yeahs' second album, Show Your Bones, was {{released}} in March 2006, followed a year later by another EP, Is Is.

5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> You Want.

She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E
25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, {{and at once}} it struck <b>me</b> <b>what</b> quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E

That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
