5|$|By August 1987, Biden's {{campaign}} {{had begun to}} lag behind those of <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> and Richard Gephardt, although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.|$|E

Gore carried seven {{states in the}} primaries, finishing third overall.|$|E
5|$|After Biden {{withdrew from}} the race, it was learned that he had indeed {{correctly}} credited Kinnock on other occasions. But in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis,</b> the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, his campaign manager and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could not recover.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} caused Democratic presidential nominee <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in New Orleans.

5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis,</b> and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{defeated}} Native American activist Russell Means at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in Seattle {{to win the}} party's presidential nomination. Former Alaska State representative Andre Marrou {{was selected}} as his running mate. After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from presidential debates. On Election Day, {{he was on the}} ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind Democratic candidate <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> and the winner Vice President George H.W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis.</b> He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
50|$|As MBA president, {{among other}} initiatives, he and Governor <b>Michael</b> S. <b>Dukakis</b> {{appointed}} a blue-ribbon Commission on the Unmet Legal Needs of Children, whose report and recommendations led to enactment of new statutes protecting the legal rights of children.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Parks was {{the first}} African American Secretary of Education {{for the state of}} Massachusetts.

5000|$|Dukakis stated on January 31, 2014, {{that he was}} not {{in favor}} of an effort to rename South Station as the [...] "Gov. <b>Michael</b> S. <b>Dukakis</b> Transportation Center".

5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). This is not to say every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in 2012, and it was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed to carry a single county.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{events have}} {{included}} Artquake, an art festival that attracted 200,000 people on Labor Day weekends in the Park Blocks from 1982 {{until at least}} 2003 and based on an art show that began in July 1949, a 1983 protest against U.S. nuclear missiles placed in Europe (3,000 protesters), an Oregon Public Employees Union strike in 1987, a rally with presidential candidate <b>Michael</b> <b>Dukakis</b> in 1988, Shakespeare in the Parks in 1989, a 1990 rally {{to pay tribute to}} Mulugeta Seraw, killed in Portland by white power skinheads in 1988, which had 1,500 people with 150 police officers defending against skinheads, and the Homowo Festival of African Arts held from 1990 to at least 2004. Lara Flynn Boyle filmed scenes from The Temp in the South Park Blocks in 1992, and The Hunted was filmed partially in the South Park Blocks in 2003, including a crash scene by Benicio del Toro.|$|E
