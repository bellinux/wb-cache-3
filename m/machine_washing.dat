40|$|Durable, {{electrically}} conducting yarns are {{a critical}} component of electronic textiles (e-textiles). Here, such yarns with exceptional wear and wash resistance are realized through dyeing silk from the silkworm Bombyx mori with the conjugated polymer:polyelectrolyte complex PEDOT:PSS. A high Young's modulus of approximately 2 GPa combined with a robust and scalable dyeing process results in up to 40 m long yarns that maintain their bulk electrical conductivity of approximately 14 S cm(- 1) when experiencing repeated bending stress as well as mechanical wear during sewing. Moreover, a high degree of ambient stability is paired with the ability to withstand both <b>machine</b> <b>washing</b> and dry cleaning.

Recent research shows that fuzzy logic approach responds much faster than any other conventional technique. This fuzzy logic controller microchip for washing machine has 36 Input/Output (I/O) pins including two Vdd and two Vss. On chip fuzzification, Fuzzy Inference Engine, Defuzzification, ROM-based Fuzzy sets and MIN-MAX array-based Fuzzy rules are the salient features of the design.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of thermal decontamination procedures for fibrelight laryngoscope blades, to comply with international guidelines, will have considerable economical effects. We evaluated the effect of mechanical cleaning plus thermal disinfection at 90 degreesC, with or without subsequent steam sterilisation at 134 degreesC, on light intensity provided by fibrelight laryngoscopes. After mounting the blades in a special frame with a built-in light source, light intensity was measured using radiometer/photometer. In total, 14 blades provided by 11 companies were tested.

40|$|Carcass beef has {{traditionally}} been washed by hand to remove foreign material such as hair, soil particles, and microbiological organisms that have contaminated the surfaces. These carcasses are inspected by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) to detect defects related to carcass cleanliness.

40|$|Common {{household}} water-use {{activities such}} as showering, bathing, drinking, and washing clothes or dishes are potentially important contributors to individual exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs), the major class of disinfection by-products of water treated with chlorine. Previous {{studies have focused on}} showering or bathing activities. In this study, we selected 12 common water-use activities and determined which may lead to the greatest THM exposures and result in the greatest increase in the internal dose. Seven subjects performed the various water-use activities in two residences served by water utilities with relatively high and moderate total THM levels. To maintain a consistent exposure environment, the activities, exposure times, air exchange rates, water flows, water temperatures, and extraneous THM emissions to the indoor air were carefully controlled. Water, indoor air, blood, and exhaled-breath samples were collected during each exposure session for each activity, in accordance with a strict, well-defined protocol.
