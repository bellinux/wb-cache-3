40|$|International audienceThe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) {{has brought}} the Mediterranean region back to the {{political}} agenda. This volume provides, for the first time, a comprehensive overview and comparative analysis of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> of governmental and non-governmental actors, from above and below. It includes case studies on the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> of numerous southern and eastern Mediterranean States, various EU Member States, and the EU itself. The case studies explain how and why these States, all participating in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, now UfM, are according a particular importance to the Mediterranean region within their foreign policies. The case studies on civil society groups or social movements such as informal or formal human rights networks, women’s networks, migrant networks, or entrepreneurs provide a broad overview of the multifaceted and dynamic civil society landscape in the Euro-Mediterranean region. Bringing together well-known scholars and experts from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, the book explores the questions of why and how the forms, the intensity, and the efficiency of interactions and articulations between the above and the below are developing within <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The French Annales School {{had already}} put an {{emphasis}} on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the [...] "history of events" [...] of high politics.

40|$|The revolts {{sweeping}} across North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 have shaken long-held {{truths about}} the region. Most strikingly, {{the sustainability of}} these regimes has proved a chimera. The events {{in the region and}} the many truths they uncovered call for a serious rethink in Western policies towards the region. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore what such a rethink might entail for the European Union. Reviewing the European Neighbourhood Policy by revamping the benefits on offer, reconsidering the effective use of conditionality, establishing adequate monitoring mechanisms and engaging with a plethora of partners both within and beyond the region is imperative. Such a review is contingent on the recognition of a reversed hierarchy of priorities, induced by the force of historical events unfolding in the region. To reverse policy priorities is no small feat, considering the entrenched logic that has sustained Euro-Med policies so far. Nonetheless, various dynamics press for a new way of thinking. The proposals contained in this study constitute concrete steps to rethink the EU’s <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> in line with the fundamental rights and principles which the Union seeks to advance in its external action...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{promotion}} of intercultural dialogue (ICD) {{in the framework of}} EU external action on the Mediterranean between 1990 and 2014. ICD is understood as a cultural foreign policy instrument that the EU has promoted in a changing, vague and contradictory manner to engage the civil societies of Europe and of the Mediterranean into a common effort to attenuate the tensions that derive from the socio-cultural divergences among the people and governments of this whole area. With the goal of shedding light on this obscure aspect of EU policy-making in the Mediterranean, this thesis aims primarily to analyse why the approach of the EU to ICD has changed during the time frame in reference, and how the EU has modified the formulation, implementation and role of this policy instrument. Guided by the conceptual lens of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA), the research examines ICD within a broader analysis of the evolution of EU foreign policy in the area. It argues that the EU commitment to advance ICD within its <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> can be divided into three distinct phases: a ‘phase of emergence’ (1990 - 2001), a ‘phase of consolidation’ (2001 - 2010) and a ‘phase of professionalisation’ (2010 - 2014). The main factor that shaped this three-phase evolution is identified in how EU policy-makers assessed the potential contribution of ICD to address the changing socio-cultural divide in the Euro-Mediterranean space following three major events: a) the conclusion of the Cold War in 1990; b) the terror attacks of 9 / 11 2001; and c) the outbreak of the Arab uprisings in December 2010...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comprehensive}} analysis of the Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land. It discusses their early development and their rising importance in the Latin East. It explores the strong connection between the order's growth and the enthusiasm of the Gennan nobility for crusading to the Holy Land. Within this the brethren's relationship to the empire and the papacy at this time is examined closely. Crucially, this thesis seeks to nuance the current contention that the order was merely {{an expression of the}} emperor's <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> and demonstrate that its intentions, like its interests, lay in the defence of Christendom, not in the wars ofthe papacy and empire. Over time the order acquired major territorial holdings in Livonia and Prussia and the effect of these growing military and financial commitments upon its Levantine branch is examined to show the way in which defeats and opportunities on these northern frontiers could impact upon the Levant. Within the Latin East itself, the order's relationship with the lay and ecclesiastical hierarchies is analysed to evaluate their contribution to the local politics of the Holy Land. Furthennore, the brethren's role in the Eastern Mediterranean is continually contrasted with that of the Templars and Hospitallers to highlight the similarities and differences between their institution and these older orders. Internally, the order's system of control and organisation is examined to discuss how effectively the institution overcame the challenges of its geographically dispersed commitments and how factions within the order, which advocated the needs ofeach separate frontier, affected its general policy. In short, this is a detailed study of the Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land which places both their military and internal affairs {{in the context of their}} responsibilities in the Baltic and the wider poli~ics of the medieval world.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), launched in 2008 amid great controversy within the European Union. Affected from the start by negative fallout from the failure of Middle East peace initiatives, its inadequacies have been underlined by the popular movement for regime change in the Arab world. Leading experts provide here the first integrated analysis of the significance and shortcomings of the UfM. Beginning with critical questioning of the motives and institutional logics informing this venture, the collection proceeds to analyse its key actors, as well as major policy dossiers such as energy and development. The book explains how and why an initiative aiming to depoliticize Euro-Mediterranean relations in fact proved wide open to political discord, bringing huge disruption to UfM activity. While some aspects are found to have merit, the volume is critical {{of the way in}} which EU <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policy</b> became driven by a narrow range of national interests, lost sight of the political objectives of the preceding Barcelona Process and became overwhelmingly bilateral in approach, at the expense of more ambitious region-building efforts.
