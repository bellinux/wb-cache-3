The public interest standard is generally broader than the competition analysis authorized by the antitrust laws and conducted by the DOJ.

We draw from the concept of organizational identity and on the literature on knowledge sharing across boundaries to analyze three information systems development (ISD) projects in a large teaching healthcare centre resulting from the merger of five hospitals. We propose a multilevel model that suggests that the interaction of organizational identity and cross-boundary knowledge sharing may result in information systems with final functionality different from planned functionality.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} about firm’s merger and competition behavior in modern economies in which networks are ever-more important and how to optimize merger policy when network externalities present. As a demand-side economics of scale, network externalities bring benefit to consumers through merger and acquisition if the products from different firms are incompatible. Hence, a merger, which is both socially optimal and privately profitable, can exist without considering the supply-side economies of scale. Merger policy should be revised {{to be able to}} recognize these “good” mergers and encourage them. Firm’s incentive to merge is enlarged by network effect because <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> can benefit from a larger network, which increases the demand for their product. Moreover, merger and acquisition in network world give the <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> an advantage in competition over the firms who stand outside the merger. One of the explanations for this advantage is <b>merged</b> <b>entity</b> may inherit indirect network resources, for example complementary products producers, from all merged firms, since the mobile of these resources are costly and slow. Acquiring more firms brings more indirect network resources to <b>merged</b> <b>entity,</b> which makes the products of <b>merged</b> <b>entity</b> more valuable to the consumers. Thus the <b>merged</b> <b>entity</b> can charge a higher price or squeeze more market share. <b>Merged</b> <b>entity</b> can obtain locked-in consumers from all merged firms is another explanation of the advantage. For some information products, such as TV subscription, internet access and mobile phone service, consumers need to sign a contract with the service provider and are locked by these contracts for a fixed period. <b>Merged</b> <b>entity</b> may inherit these locked-in consumers and show a larger initial network to the consumers who are not locked {{at the beginning of the}} competition. Social planner should be cautious to the merger in network world because network externalities magnify the power of the merger, which may be utilized by the firms to get dominant position.

40|$|It {{has long}} been thought that, of all EU {{competition}} processes, merger regulation was immune from arbitration. This has changed dramatically {{over the last few}} years. Starting in 2000, the European Commission accepted, albeit reluctantly, to consider behavioural commitments made by <b>merging</b> <b>entities.</b> In the past, the Commission had considered that such commitments were not adequate to ensure competitive market structures. Compliance with structural remedies can be monitored fairly easily by the Commission. Structural commitments entail mostly divestments needed to maintain an acceptable level of competition. Behavioural commitments, however, require more extensive monitoring, since they concern the future behaviour of the merged entity. Monitoring these commitments is time consuming and the Merger Task Force (MTF) does not have the necessary resources to do so. One of the solutions favoured by the MTF to monitor compliance with these new commitments, is to impose an arbitration agreement to the merged entity.

40|$|International audienceCornelia de Lange {{syndrome}} (CdLS) and KBG syndrome are {{two distinct}} developmental pathologies sharing common {{features such as}} intellectual disability, psychomotor delay, and some craniofacial and limb abnormalities. Mutations {{in one of the}} five genes NIPBL, SMC 1 A, SMC 3, HDAC 8 or RAD 21, were identified in at least 70 % of the patients with CdLS. Consequently, additional causative genes, either unknown or responsible of partially <b>merging</b> <b>entities,</b> possibly account for the remaining 30 % of the patients. In contrast, KBG has only been associated with mutations in ANKRD 11. By exome sequencing we could identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ANKRD 11 in two patients with the clinical diagnosis of CdLS. Both patients show features reminiscent of CdLS such as characteristic facies as well as a small head circumference which is not described for KBG syndrome. Patient A, who carries the mutation in a mosaic state, is a 4 -year-old girl with features reminiscent of CdLS. Patient B, a 15 -year-old boy, shows a complex phenotype which resembled CdLS during infancy, but has developed to a more KBG overlapping phenotype during childhood. These findings point out the importance of screening ANKRD 11 in young CdLS patients who were found to be negative for mutations in the five known CdLS genes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effects of the Pfizer and Pharmacia (2003) merger on {{competition}} in the Swiss pharmaceutical market and compares the assessment of the Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) with the post-merger market developments. We find that the merger has had a miniscule impact on the Swiss pharmaceutical market. This has primarily {{to do with the fact}} that the product portfolios of both companies have shown no or only slight overlaps. In both cases of potential anticompetitive effects, the companies successfully proposed to divest some of their assets in order to prevent a further strengthening of their dominant position. The remedies included products in the development phase which were not available on the market at the time of the decision. In other markets in which either an overlapping of businesses of both companies existed or in which one of the <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> held a dominant market position, no significant effects of the merger were noticed. This might have to do with both, existing price regulation in the Swiss drug industry and changes in Pfizer’s product portfolio following the merger. Furthermore, with respect to other potentially interesting market characteristics such as investment behaviour, R&D, sales or employment, available data on global company level does not allow an isolation of the possible effects of the merger...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of biotechnology necessitating change in traditional pharmacological research, cost cutting by hospitals and health insurers, {{and an increasing}} number of patent expirations have posed a considerable challenge to the pharmaceutical industry, which hitherto had been considered recession-proof. Responding to this challenge, the industry has undergone tremendous consolidation through mergers and acquisitions (M&As). These M&As have resulted in high concentration within the therapeutic classes of drugs, thereby raising anticompetitive concerns. In order to allow the mergers to proceed, the Federal Trade Commission in the U. S. had required the <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> to divest their R&D assets. The European Commission, on the contrary, had taken more permissive approach. The thesis has argued that R&D divestitures in pharmaceutical cases have not been appropriate as anticompetitive concern arises owing to the acquisition of market power with drug purchasers, rather than the combination of R&D assets. The innovative nature of the industry, and the costs and risks involved in drug discovery make it hard to analyze the likely future state of the market. Ex-post analysis shows that divestiture in these cases proved counterproductive. It is suggested that ex-post remedies like compulsory licensing and price regulation are preferable in pharmaceutical mergers, as they do not disrupt the companies' R&D structure. Moreover, these remedies could be applied once the anticompetitive concerns become apparent the merger is consummated, thereby allaying the uncertainty involved in the assessment of the future state of innovation markets...|$|E

The study applied a mixed-use methodology. The case study evidence was drawn from {{the formation of the}} “Big Four Banks” in South Africa, namely, Absa (“Barclays Africa Group”), First Rand Group, Nedbank Group and Standard Bank Group. The study found that when visions and values of merging banks were aligned, there was a greater chance of success. The study further found that culture compatibility of <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> is paramount. Stakeholder acceptance was also found to have a strong impact on the chance of success or failure in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The case evidence corroborated and substantiated that there was a positive Deal Value Added (DVA) trend before the merger activity and immediately thereafter, evidenced by positive share price appreciation resulting in increased market capitalisation. The quantitative results found that 56 % of the sampled CEOs indicated that an 80 % majority of bank mergers in the South African banking sector had created value over the long term, evidenced by 10 -year return trends. This study contributes to the corpus of knowledge by generating an integrated assessment framework that can be applied even beyond the South African environment, by practitioners involved in mergers and acquisition activities.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present our {{approach}} to the identity resolution problem: discovering references to {{one and the same}} object that come from different sources. Solving this problem is important for a number of different communities (e. g. Database, NLP and Semantic Web) that process heterogeneous data where variations of the same objects are referenced in different formats (e. g. textual documents, web pages, database records, ontologies etc.). Identity resolution aims at creating a single view into the data where different facts are interlinked and incompleteness is remedied. We propose a four-step approach that starts with schema alignment of incoming data sources. As a second step - candidate selection - we discard those entities that are totally different from those that they are compared to. Next the main evidence for identity of two entities comes from applying similarity measures comparing their attribute values. The last step in the identity resolution process is data fusion or <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> found to be identical into a single object. The principal novel contribution of our solution is the use of a rich semantic knowledge representation that allows for flexible and unified interpretation during the resolution process. Thus we are not restricted in the type of information that can be processed (although we have focussed our work on problems relating to information extracted from text). We report the implementation of these four steps in an IDentity Resolution Framework (IDRF) and their application to two use-cases. We propose a rule based approach for customisation in each step and introduce logical operators and their interpretation during the process. Our final evaluation shows that this approach facilitates high accuracy in resolving identity. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the study of the {{complexity}} of entities in the US banking sector. To this end, three lines of research are pursued in this thesis. We start with an investigation analysing the importance of strategic fit for post-M&A performance, {{which is one of the}} necessary prior steps for a financial institution to become complex. Second, we extend our investigation to analyse the effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act. 2010 to control the risk and non-traditional banking activities of complex bank holding companies. This law is considered one of the main avenues for the US government to control the continuously growing complexity of financial institutions. Lastly, we explore the influence of the complexity of banks on the composition of their board according to the degree of busyness of board members in terms of sitting on other boards. Using different econometric approaches and different samples, we present robust evidence for several findings. Firstly, strategic fit plays a key role as a performance enhancing factor for banks that decide to expand their market and/or diversify their products portfolio through pursuing merger deals. The subsequent analysis finds that the Dodd-Frank Act. 2010 has distinct effects on the risk and non-banking activities among the different types of complex BHCs. Moreover, we present differences between large and consolidated BHCs in their “shadow” banking activities following the enactment of this law. Furthermore, we observe that banks continue increasing their proportions of independent directors. However, banks require independent board members with fewer commitments from outside boards. Lastly, the busyness degree of the executive board members is related to the organisational complexity between banks and their subsidiaries. The empirical results give rise to numerous important policy implications. The supervision of a proper degree of strategic fit in key aspects between <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> before a merger approval might increase the probability to achieve positive post-mergers outputs and reduce early bailouts that affect local economies. Furthermore, the recent re-regulatory changes have achieve to partially increase the stability of BHCs in which policy makers should consider the nature of complexity to have a better control of their risk, especially placing limits on their risky non-traditional banking activities. Finally, it has highlighted the importance of laws, related to the appointment of the board members, to take into account the individual complexity of each banking institution. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the post-merger integration in the Faculty of Business at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), the largest third-level educational institution in the Republic of Ireland, and specifically {{to focus on the}} mental models and perceptions of employees in this Faculty regarding post-merger integration. The literature review draws upon a number of disciplinary stands, namely corporate strategy, change management, organisational culture and the higher education merger literature. From the exta,nt literature, it was evident that a number of research gaps existed, in relation to the 'post-merger' or 'post-integration' stage, and specifically regarding the human and 'soft' issues of a merger. A further gap in the merger literature pertains to the role and importance of a new physical environment in the post-merger stage. A related, but under-researched issue is the concept of territoriality, which in tum may result in a 'them' and 'us' mentality, amongst <b>merging</b> <b>entities.</b> A further research consideration was the extent to which there was a singular Faculty culture. ''-''' For the purpose of this thesis, forty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with participants from the Faculty of Business at the Dublin Institute of Technology. A phenomenological approach was identified as best capturing the focus of this research which was to gain insights into DIT employees' mental models of the post-integration phase. The key findings emanating from this thesis were that employees were very au fait with the rationale for the merger and perceived it in a very pragmatic fashion. The study also found that the new physical environment was overwhelmingly a source of motivation and job satisfaction to the participants. However, at another level, the vastness and layout of the physical environment was seen to be an inhibitor to social integration; Another key theme which arose was that of territoriality which was also related again to a 'them' and 'us' mentality which emerged across many of the interviews. The author identified a number of sub-cultures, as opposed to the existence of a singular Faculty culture, and identified the linkages between these sub-cultures through an innovative application of Thompson's (2001) adaptation of Miles and Snow's (1978 b) seminal classification. Finally, the key findings are synthesised in a conceptual framework and the author presents a number of recommendations for future research, and for organisations undertaking a merger change initiative.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. The {{educational}} reforms {{implemented by}} the Department of Education {{during the last decade}} have resulted in a number of high profile public university mergers taking place in South Africa. The private higher education sector has simultaneously been significantly restructured by new educational legislation, {{to such an extent that}} a numerous private providers have been forced to cease operations due to the onerous requirements of the new laws. In this context, private higher education institutions are increasingly being compelled to consider alternative strategic options in order to continue to operate as viable entities. This study examined two private theological higher education institutions operating in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, and considered whether a merger of the two organisations would be advantageous in light of the pressures being faced by the institutions. The objectives of the study were to assess first, whether a merger of the two institutions would be feasible and second, whether it would be desirable. The study reviewed the literature relating to various forms of organisational co-operation, focusing particularly on mergers. The benefits associated with mergers were highlighted as well as the major causes of the extraordinarily high merger failure rate experienced in practice. The tendency of leaders of <b>merging</b> <b>entities</b> to overlook cultural and people issues when planning and implementing a merger was noted. Attention was given to the managerial approaches necessary to reduce the risk of merger failure. Factors specific to mergers within the non-profit and educational sectors were considered, focusing on structural options for multi-campus educational institutions in particular. The methodology used to address the research objectives called for the conducting of structured interviews with a sample of employees and Board or Council members from both institutions, as well as an examination of various institutional records. Employees of both institutions completed a simple questionnaire designed to provide data for an analysis of the respective organisational cultures of the two institutions. The findings of the study suggested that a merger between the institutions would be feasible, but that employees of the two organisations are not generally of the view that a merger would be desirable in the short term. There was however more support in principle for a merger in the medium to long term and the study consequently recommends that a joint task team be established to prepare a roadmap for the ultimate merger of the two institutions. In the short term it is recommended that a joint venture or strategic alliance be entered into by the two organisations primarily in order to test the compatibility of the two organisational cultures. Further recommendations cover issues such as the ideal structure for the merged entity and the process necessary to successfully manage the integration of two separate organisational cultures...|$|E
