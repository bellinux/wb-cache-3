5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

25|$|In December 2016, Schumer {{demanded a}} congressional inquiry into Russian meddling of U.S. affairs. In January 2017 he said “Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> {{you take on}} the {{intelligence}} community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments. Later that month he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.|$|E
25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story {{in her own}} words, in the literal sense that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of {{events leading up to}} {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
500|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> though— there's a huge {{difference}} between the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix. They're {{not even close to}} the same. In one, the cobbles are used every day by the cars, and kept up, and stuff like that. The other one— it's completely different ... The best I could do would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That's Paris–Roubaix. It's that bad— it's ridiculous." [...] - Chris Horner ...|$|E

500|$|St. Leger took {{advantage}} of his victory to deliver another demand for the fort's surrender, which Gansevoort also rejected. The next day St. Leger sent in a third surrender demand, which included (false) news that Burgoyne was in Albany as well as threats that the Indians would be permitted to massacre the garrison and destroy the Mohawk valley communities from which the garrison was drawn. [...] In an eloquent refusal, Lieutenant Colonel Willett responded, [...] "By your uniform you are British officers. Therefore let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the message you have brought is a degrading one for a British officer to send and by no means reputable for a British officer to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
500|$|Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf {{speaking}} to Raymond Seitz, then Minister at the US Embassy in London, [...] "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We {{have lived in}} peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something. In war, innocent people always suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E

[...] "The more money they steal, the longer they'll get; you know that, cap'n, without <b>me</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you.</b> If {{you could put}} fifty quid in {{it would be so}} much the better. And, what-ever you do, don't make a noise. I don't want a lot o' clumsy policemen interfering in my business." ...|$|R
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her.

In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation.

500|$|In 1925, Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski {{and played}} the Bach Chaconne in D minor for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti {{received}} a telegram from Stokowski’s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering stage fright. He was {{taken aback by the}} American concert scene, and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, [...] "Well, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Mister Dzigedy—and I know what I’m talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!") ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing [...] "Trying {{to make this work}} / but you act like a jerk." [...] As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing [...] "the dunce cap is off". [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] contains a lyrical metaphor, [...] "Blood on your hands." ...|$|E
500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
