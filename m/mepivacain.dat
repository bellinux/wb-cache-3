40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{optimise}} {{the satisfaction}} of patients after repair of primary inguinal hernias under local anaesthesia, we analysed the analgetic power of Ropivacain in the postoperative period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients underwent repair under local anaesthesia with the same volume of 0. 75 % Ropivacain or 1 % <b>Mepivacain</b> in a randomised and blinded manner. Postoperative pain analysis {{was carried out in}} all patients. RESULTS: Subjective pain levels at rest and under stress as well as impairment by pain were found to be significantly lower in the Ropivacain group at the day of operation. Decrease in vital capacity and peak flow showed similar results. The postoperative amount of analgesics and time of mobilisation showed a positive influence by the use of Ropivacain. CONCLUSION: Ropivacain reduces postoperative pain levels after hernia repair. This leads to increased comfort for patients, without elevated perioperative risk...|$|E
