40|$|The Ultrafast optical <b>word</b> <b>generator</b> is {{an optical}} fiber {{communication}} subsystem under development by several researches in the Ultrafast Optics Lab. This system proposes to take parallel electrical data streams and serialize them onto a single optical channel. Potential {{applications of the}} optical <b>word</b> <b>generator</b> include its use in optical time-division multiplexing {{and also in the}} encryption of high-speed optical data streams. Two of the main components of the <b>word</b> <b>generator</b> are the direct space to time arrayed waveguide grating pulse shaper (DSTAWG), and the asymmetric Fabry-Perot modulator (AFPM). ^ This thesis covers development and modifications of the DSTAWG for incorporation into the <b>word</b> <b>generator,</b> and demonstrates reconfigurable direct space to time pulse shaping. The design of the AFPM is described and development of its fabrication process is discussed. The results of fabrication efforts to date are cataloged. ...|$|R

We consider the <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> level alignment easier and more reliable than the manual alignment on syntactic and semantic level. Thus, after <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> level alignment we apply an automatic procedure for the construction of semantic level alignments. Our work presents the main steps of this automatic procedure which exploits the syntactic analysis of both sentences, morphosyntactic annotation, <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> level alignment in producing the semantic annotation of the sentences and semantic alignment. Last, but not least, a method for identification of potential errors is discussed using the automatically constructed semantic analyses of Bulgarian sentences and their comparison to the semantic representation of the English sentences...|$|R

40|$|Preordering of {{a source}} {{language}} sentence to match target word order {{has proved to}} be useful for improving machine translation systems. Previous work has shown that a reordering model can be learned from high quality <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> alignments to improve machine translation performance. In this paper, we focus on further improving the performance of the reordering model (and thereby machine translation) by using a larger corpus of sentence aligned data for which <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> alignments are not available but automatic machine generated alignments are available. The main challenge we tackle is to generate quality data for training the reordering model in spite of the machine alignments being noisy. To mitigate the effect of noisy machine alignments, we propose a novel approach that improves reorderings produced given noisy alignments and also improves word alignments using information from the reordering model. This approach generates alignments that are 2. 6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner. The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1. 8 BLEU points on the NIST MT- 08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> alignments, and a gain of 5. 2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline. ...|$|R

However, in the <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> response task, the only component that produced significant interference on its own was response set membership. These results do not support predictions made by recent translation models (see W. R. Glaser & M. O. Glaser [1989] and Sugg & McDonald [1994]). A possible solution was suggested that located two sites for Stroop interference.

Human word segmentation errors will occur when the subjects try to cheat by segmenting randomly or make accidental mistakes.|$|R

40|$|Yawat 1 is a {{tool for}} the {{visualization}} and manipulation of word- and phrase-level alignments of parallel text. Unlike most other tools for <b>manual</b> <b>word</b> alignment, it relies on dynamic markup to visualize alignment relations, that is, markup is shown and hidden depending on the current mouse position. This reduces the visual complexity of the visualization and allows the annotator to focus on one item at a time. For a birdâs-eye view of alignment patterns within a sentence, the tool is also able to display alignments as alignment matrices. In addition, it allows for manual labeling of alignment relations with customizable tag sets. Different text colors are used to indicate which words in a given sentence pair have already been aligned, and which ones {{still need to be}} aligned. Tag sets and color schemes can easily be adapted to the needs of specific annotation projects through configuration files.

The function word classification representing intrinsic features of syntactic usages is used to supervise the grammar induction, {{and the structure of}} the taxonomy is learned simultaneously. The grammar learning process is no longer a unilaterally supervised training by hierarchical knowledge, but an interactive process between the knowledge structure learning and the grammar training. The established taxonomy implies the stochastic significance of the diversified syntactic features.
