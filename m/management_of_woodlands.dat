40|$|In many {{situations}} commercialization of forest products {{is based on}} common pool resources; often this leads to resource depletion. This paper investigates the potential of using fiscal instruments for institutional change to improve resource management where natural products are being marketed from common pool resources. Three markets along the Masvingo-Beitbridge Road in Southern Zimbabwe were studied. A simple model was produced to test the impact of fiscal instruments on the net revenue to carvers and the consequences for woodland management. The results {{suggest that there are}} few, if any options for the introduction of fiscal mechanisms to improve the management of the indigenous woodlands, and the creation of common-property institutions for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> {{solely on the basis of}} financial incentives generated from woodcarving is highly unlikely...|$|E
40|$|Tropical forests {{account for}} over 50 % {{of the global}} forested area and forest carbon stock. Although the {{deforestation}} rate is tending to decline, forests are confronted with climate change, which could profoundly modify their functioning. The migration of species that {{took place during the}} Pleistocene is no longer possible because human activities have markedly altered tropical landscapes. Forest species will thus have to adapt (or not) particularly to the increased water stress. Forest management methods must incorporate new knowledge on the vulnerability of species and evolve in order to reduce potentially negative interactions between disturbances and the water deficit. A key challenge is to identify trade-offs between logging in water deficit situations and the increased forest fire risk. In drylands, factors related to climate change are meshed with other change factors, but innovations in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> could ensure their long-term persistence.

40|$|The present article {{represents}} a complete review of all published data (with corrections) on bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus distribution in Serbia and Montenegro. On the other hand, data of 63 unpublished records {{stored in the}} period from 1956 to 1983 in the Mammal Study Collection of the Natural History Museum, Belgrade had not been processed until now. In the period from 1992 to 2004, 29 new findings were recorded, 12 of them outside the currently known area of distribution. New data reveal a wider distribution of bank vole than was known until now, completing and partly modifying previous knowledge about this rodent's bionomy and ecology in Serbia and Montenegro. The occurrence of bank vole in the Prokletije Mountains, Kosovo and Metohija represents its highest known altitude in Europe (2500 m). On {{the basis of these}} new data and observations, we can conclude that bank vole is continuously present in small and linear fragments of autochthonous woodlands on plains and hills, and that there are no large discontinuities in its distribution in Serbia and Montenegro, as was assumed earlier. In efforts to preserve overall biological diversity, the example of the bank vole underlines the need to intensify protection and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> especially remaining fragments of forests on plains and in hills...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the paper {{of the same}} name written by J. H. Newnham 70 years ago, and then outlines the current situation and trends. The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> is a long-term process, but it is nevertheless disturbing to note that much of the broadleaved woodland in Britain today is still suffering the same haphazard management Newnham complained of, with high levels of under-management and a poor growing stock. Newnham also regarded the forest industry which utilizes timber from British woodlands as not keeping up to date with new ideas and methods, and not giving consumers the goods they actually require. There have been many significant advances in softwood processing during the last 70 years, but this level of innovation is not evident in the hardwood sector. The importance that we now place on the amenity and environmental value of broadleaved woodland should not prevent managers from growing at least some high-quality trees with a view to their providing a contribution towards the costs of management. This will not happen unless there is a robust and concerted effort to manage deer and squirrels in broadleaved woodlands. New markets for some traditional products, develop-ments in technology and the willingness of people to network information may offer a wider range of outlets to woodland owners in the future.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{environmental}} conservation in the UK {{has seen a}} shift towards the inclusion of local communities in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands.</b> In order to assess the feasibility of combining community involvement with conservation, a case study from the Community Forest Programme was used to identify possible conflicting objectives. With the aim of identifying the social and environmental benefits {{that can be achieved}} from forestry and the methods by which these benefits can be achieved, survey data was collected from a variety of environmental organisations, including those from the Community Forest Programme. Also, a public survey was conducted from which information was gathered regarding the extent to which residents interact and engage with their local woodland. The research found that theoretically little compromise need be made to maximise the associated social and environmental benefits of forestry, although in practice external influences often require organisations to prioritise their actions. Depending on whether an organisation has a particular focus, the need to prioritise actions will result in either social or environmental benefits taking precedence over the other. The conclusions that can be drawn from this report are that it is feasible to combine community involvement with conservation to maximise the social and environmental benefits of forestry, although the structure of the woodland management plan and the resources available are crucial in achieving this objective.

During the last decade, <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> in the Sudanian region of Benin {{has been based on}} enrichment with valuable tree-species. Yet, no previous research has been undertaken to support enrichment design with respect to plant eye view, tree growth magnitude or survival capacity under local forest environments. To fill in this gap, Ripley's K function was used to assess the spatial pattern of trees, diameter classes and dominant valuable species in the Sudanian zone. Data were collected in four sites of variable size (150 x 100 m, 150 x 100 m, 100 x 50 m and 150 x 150 m). Mostly, the spatial patterns of the target species revealed small-clumps. Within these small-clumps, intraspecific repulsions were observed on average at a 3 m scale, while interspecific repulsions were noticed at a 4. 5 m scale. Only a weak repulsion between diameter size was also remarked, suggesting that proximity to adult trees would not affect the survival of young plants. With regard to observed repulsion scales, we would suggest using a minimum of a 3 m space between trees of the same species and a 4. 5 m space between trees of different species, for enrichment plantings in Sudanian woodlands, if based on the target species. However, this suggested spacing may not be optimal with regard to plant growth. Further investigation is needed to address this aspect...|$|E

This research considers utilisation of botanical resources from two farm sites; Hrísheimar, an iron production centre and farm, and Skútustaðir, a farmstead occupied from landnám to the 20 th century. A total of 56 bulk samples from Hrísheimar and 81 from Skútustaðir were processed and analysed for their macrobotanical remains. The main research questions addressed were: •	Was evidence of arable agriculture visible? •	What wood procurement strategies were utilised, and was there evidence regarding the use and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands?</b> •	What other botanical resources were exploited from the local landscape? •	Was there any evidence for trade in plant resources? Conclusions from the new dataset produced indicate that barley was grown at both locations, while oat may have been trialled at Hrísheimar in the landnám period. Wood remained the main fuel across sites, contexts and time. This appears to have been mainly sourced from the local birch woodland, but also included some evidence of driftwood, and in the case of Skútustaðir, imported species such as oak, yew and hazel. Selective harvesting techniques, apparent from landnám, suggest early attempts at conservation of local woodland. Macro-floral suites reflected local habitats which demonstrated a richer diversity at Skútustaðir; however, possible wetland expansion following forest clearance appears to have occurred later at this site. A range of trees, shrubs, weeds and wild plants may have been gathered to satisfy various culinary, craft and medicinal needs. While trade is more evident at Skútustaðir, with the recovery of imported wood, fruit and grain, this activity was not widespread prior to the abandonment of Hrísheimar. It is significant that, while past research proposes severe arboreal depletion soon after landnám, current charcoal data demonstrates the presence of wood as fuel into the final phase for each site...|$|E

In the present article (1) we evaluate the actual state of the habitats by the 28 threat types documented during the MÉTA mapping; (2) we introduce 12 newly developed indicators, which were applied for the semi-quantitative comparison of the overall degree of endangerment of the Hungarian habitats. Based on the summarisation of our results the most seriously endangered habitats in Hungary are as follows: sand and loess steppe oak woodlands (M 2, M 4, L 2 x), tussock sedge communities (B 4), extensive orchards (P 7), closed lowland oak woodlands (L 5, L 6), wa-ter-fringing and fen tall herb communities (D 5), wooded pastures (P 45), vegetation of loess cliffs (I 2), rich fens and Molinia meadows (D 1, D 2), Cynosurion grasslands and Nardus swards (E 34), swamp woodlands (J 2), xero-mesophilous grasslands (H 4) and salt steppe oak woodlands (M 3).

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in Tanzania {{to assess the}} effect of some macro-economic policies on livelihood strategies for households within or in close proximity in miombo woodlands. The focus was on how their responses are impacting on the management {{and use of the}} woodlands. Data were collected at macro level from three sites categories as remote, intermediate and peri-urban. Also data on important macroeconomic trends were collected. The results indicate that reductions government spending have decreased agricultural support in terms of extension services and subsidies on farm inputs. The increase in prices of input factors relative to output has raised costs of farm inputs, cost of living in general and decreased disposable incomes for most rural dwellers, forcing some of them into extensive forest product exploitation and trade for each incomes. in the study sites, some forest products contribute between 50 - 70 % of annual household incomes. However not many households have the capacity to take the advantage of promising forest-based income generating activities. Economic hardships also led to changes in gender roles particularly in per-urban and intermediate sites. Women are increasingly expanding their roles, away from traditional domestic activities to income generating activities such as forest product exploitation and sale, casual labour and petty business. Men are gradually talking up activities which have traditionally been in the domain of women. The role of local institutions and traditional values in <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands</b> has declined. Village governments have replaced village and clan elders in land allocation. Local beliefs of value for forest protection and traditional property rights which influence utilization of communal resources have gradually been eroded.

Two villages in the upstream district of Tokamachi-shi, Niigata Prefecture were selected as study sites for a comparison of land use and farmland management. First, patterns of land use and aspects of the local environment that made farming difficult were analyzed by using GIS. Topographic differences between still-cultivated farmlands and abandoned ones were compared in terms of two of these aspects: distance from managed farm roads and degrees of slope. We found that abandoned farmlands were further from roads and steeper than cultivated ones. Maintenance of the levees around the farmlands ceased completely after cultivation was abandoned. Secondly, we conducted a survey {{to determine how the}} local farmlands were managed and how the subsidy was affecting the maintenance of farmlands. We found that the scheme was having little effect on the re-cultivation of once-abandoned farmlands or the maintenance of farmlands. However, the subsidy was being used for joint activities by the villagers and was having a positive effect on village revitalization. It was apparent that a clear vision of those measures that could help promote the ecological functions of local farmlands was needed for the effective use of the subsidy. In conclusion, we made the following points on the maintenance and promotion of the ecological functions of farmlands and woodlands. 1) To maintain the ecological functions of farmlands, and {{as an alternative to the}} current scheme, we need a new scheme that has clear objectives with regard to the management of both abandoned farmlands and still-cultivated ones. 2) Farmers need to receive assistance in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodlands,</b> because afforestation is a legitimate way to prevent decline in the ecological functions of abandoned farmlands in areas where re-cultivation is difficult and where shrubs and trees have already begun to invade...|$|E

Despite this, {{they have been}} heavily cleared, much remaining vegetation is in poor condition and many species {{of plants and animals}} are threatened. Here, we provide a brief overview of key issues relating to the ecology, management and policy directions for temperate woodlands, by identifying and discussing ten themes. When addressing issues relating to the conservation and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> temperate <b>woodlands,</b> spatial scale is very important, as are the needs for a temporal perspective and a complementary understanding of pattern and process. The extent of landscape change in many woodland environments means that woodland patches, linear networks and paddock trees are critical elements, and that there can be pervasive effects from ‘problem’ native species such as the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala). These consequences of landscape change highlight the challenge to undertake active management and restoration as well as effective monitoring and long-term data collection. In developing approaches for conservation and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> temperate <b>woodlands,</b> it is essential to move our thinking beyond reserves to woodland conservation and management on private land, and recognise the criticality of cross-disciplinary linkages. We conclude by identifying some emerging issues in woodland conservation and management. These include the need to further develop non-traditional approaches to conservation particularly off-reserve management; the value of documenting approaches and programmes that demonstrably lead to effective change; new lessons that can be learned from intact examples of temperate woodlands; and the need to recognise how climate change and human population growth will interact with conservation and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> temperate <b>woodlands</b> in future decade...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A recent upsurge of {{interest}} in early mining and metal working sites in Europe led to experimental quantification of their apparently prodigious demand for fuelwood. However, the real impact of prehistoric mining on woodland remained unknown. Excavation of a prehistoric copper mine at Copa Hill, Cwmystwyth, from 1986 - 91, afforded an opportunity for linked palaeoenvironmental investigations. Pollen analytical methods were applied in a pilot study of blanket peat deposits adjacent to the prehistoric mine at Copa Hill. Results provide circumstantial evidence linking prehistoric human activity at the mine in the Early Bronze Age both to selective woodland removal and to upland peat initiation close to the site. Woodland clearances {{seem to have been}} relatively small-scale during the inferred period of mining, with limited overall impact, suggesting either protracted small-scale mining operations, or active <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodland</b> resources.

However, evidence on its feasibility is scanty and questionable. This study examined the economic feasibility of carbon credit project development in community based forest management (CBFM) using four similar miombo woodlands from Southern highlands. The analysis was based on 144 sample plots from managed woodlands and 100 plots from business as usual (BAU) (open access). Allometric equation was applied to convert biomass to carbon per hectare. Improved carbon stock was determined and its economic value ascertained based on global voluntary carbon markets. Project feasibility analysis was performed using discounted cash flow, internal rate of return, and benefits/costs methods.

40|$|Multiproxy pollen, sediment, plant macrofossil and subfossil insect {{analyses}} {{are used to}} explore environmental change at Stóra-Mörk in southern Iceland between ad 500 and 1500. Previous palaeoecological studies in Iceland have indicated that vegetation and landscape change rapidly succeeded the initial settlement of the island around ad 871, with strong environmental consequences. However, recent high-resolution studies in western and northern Iceland suggest that the timing and amplitude of these changes may be less uniform than previously assumed. The palaeoecological evidence from Stóra-Mörk shows an initially muted anthropogenic signal. Before the early tenth century, the area was characterized by damp birch and willow woodland. Large-scale human impact did not begin until after ad 920 when a change in land use to grazing and crop production is observed in the pollen, insect and plant macrofossil records. Shifts in vegetation and insect taxa and in aeolian deposition indicate that this activity resulted in woodland reduction, increased soil instability, eutrophication and land surface drying. The relatively late appearance of large-scale human impact at Stóra-Mörk {{is consistent with the}} tenth-century farm establishment suggested by the historical record, and the delay in settlement at the location may relate to an initial avoidance <b>of</b> labour-intensive <b>woodland</b> clearance and/or <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>woodland</b> resources.

50|$|Briddlesford Copses—the {{woodland}} {{areas that}} make up the majority <b>of</b> the <b>woodland</b> in the reserve—were designated a SAC in 1995 in recognition of the internationally important breeding population of Bechstein's bats that are resident there. The rare barbastelle bat also breeds in the woods, contributing to a total of eight bat species recorded at the site. These animals are particularly associated with woodpecker holes and crevices in mature ash trees at this site. The woods support both hazel dormice and red squirrels, and alongside the bats form a mammal assemblage that is unique to the UK. The dormice have been monitored in the woodland since at least 1996. Over 530 nest boxes are arranged in two grids that contribute data to the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP) and inform the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>woodlands.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{mathematical}} policy model <b>of</b> oak <b>woodlands</b> is presented. The model {{illustrates the}} policy uncertainties {{that exist in}} the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> oak <b>woodlands.</b> These uncertainties include: (1) selection of a policy criterion function, (2) woodland dynamics, (3) initial and final state <b>of</b> the <b>woodland</b> stock. The paper provides a review of each of the uncertainty issues. The final section of the paper describes a modeling approach that can be developed to assist policy makers in evaluating alternative oak woodland policy actions. The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> natural resources is the topic of numerous academic journals, and hundreds of books and popular articles. Natural resource management has different meanings to different groups of people. Natural resources can be viewed as environmental assets which provide value to society in any number of ways. This value can be gained from using the natural resource as an input into the productive process, as a sources of raw materials, as a provider of life-sustaining services, and as a provider of esthetic and recreational amenities. The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> a natural resource is further complicated by various uncertainties. Uncertainty exists in determining the exact composition o...|$|R
