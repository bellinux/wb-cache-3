25|$|A {{number of}} magmatic {{features}} {{are present in}} the Circum-Superior Belt, including dikes, sills and volcanics that comprise geologic formations.

25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{relief of}} Bulgaria {{is a result}} of continuous geological evolution. The Bulgarian lands were often submerged by ancient seas and lakes, some land layers rose others sank. Volcanic eruptions were common both on land and in the water basins. All three main groups of rocks, magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic, are found in the country. The oldest rock formations in Bulgaria date from the Precambrian period than 500million years ago. During the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic eras (4.0billion to 252million years ago) the <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> were formed. Throughout most of that period the only land areas were Rila, Pirin and the western Rhodope Mountains. The Mesozoic era (252million to 66million years ago) saw the beginning of the Alpine orogeny that has formed the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt, including the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora. The Cenozoic era (since 66million years ago) is characterized with active tectonic processes, the definitive formation of the Balkan Mountains, the formation of grabens and horsts in Rila, Pirin and Kraishte region.|$|E

50|$|The {{geological}} {{and environmental}} {{evolution of the}} valley {{since its inception in}} the Oligocene can be seen in a variety of sedimentary and <b>magmatic</b> <b>rock</b> units, preserved as continuous sequences in the deeper basins.

500|$|The Tuzgle volcano proper is {{constructed}} from an older rhyodacite-mafic series {{and a more}} recent series constructed from andesites alone. These and neighbouring shoshonitic centres are formed from magmas with crustal contamination. Isotope analysis of <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> have shown La/Nb ratios of 1.31.6 and Ba/Ta ratios of 160260, lower than in the main volcanic front. The overall chemical composition is potassium-rich calc-alkaline. Thermobarometry indicates that the older magmas crystallized at pressures of [...] while younger ones crystallized at [...] and temperatures of about [...] These magma compositions indicate that the magmas {{are the result of}} complex mixing processes and also involve the transitional nature of the mantle beneath Tuzgle, where the more northern steep slab encounters the shallower southern subducting slab. Crystal fractionation and melting of upper crustal rocks further complicate the pattern. The lava domes which were erupted from the ground after the Tuzgle ignimbrite have volumes of , while the Platform and subsequent units have volumes of [...] The lava domes and San Antonio lava flows have porphyritic surfaces. San Antonio lavas contain large plagioclase xenocrystals and xenoliths. The ignimbrite contains Ordovician lithic fragments and 1020% pumice. Its eruption was presumably linked to high mantle melt rates; the resulting mafic magmas induced the generation of large amounts of silicic melts. Lower mantle melt rates would form mafic melts that incorporate silicic melts before erupting.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Circum-Superior Belt lies {{along the}} margin of the Superior Craton, which is the most {{extensive}} fragment of Archean crust on Earth. [...] However, a number of igneous rocks within the Superior craton remain undated, indicating the existence of <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> with the same age as those of the Circum-Superior Belt is probable.

2500|$|The oldest {{rocks on}} Earth {{are found in}} the North American craton of Canada. They are tonalites from about 4.0Ga. They show traces of {{metamorphism}} by high temperature, but also sedimentary grains that have been rounded by erosion during transport by water, showing that rivers and seas existed then. Cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of terranes. The first are so-called greenstone belts, consisting of low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. These [...] "greenstones" [...] are similar to the sediments today found in oceanic trenches, above subduction zones. For this reason, greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the Archean. The second type is a complex of felsic <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks.</b> These rocks are mostly tonalite, trondhjemite or granodiorite, types of rock similar in composition to granite (hence such terranes are called TTG-terranes). TTG-complexes are seen as the relicts of the first continental crust, formed by partial melting in basalt.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the last}} of the Kula Plate decayed and the Farallon Plate {{advanced}} back into this area from the south, it once again started to subduct under the continental margin of Western Canada 37million years ago, supporting a chain of volcanoes called the Cascade Volcanic Arc. At least four volcanic formations along the British Columbia Coast are associated with Cascadia subduction zone volcanism. The oldest is the eroded 18-million-year-old Pemberton Volcanic Belt which extends west-northwest from south-central British Columbia to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the northeast where it lies [...] west of mainland British Columbia. In the south it is defined by a group of epizonal intrusions and a few erosional remnants of eruptive rock. Farther north in the large Ha-Iltzuk and Waddington icefields, it includes two large dissected calderas called Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano while the Queen Charlotte Islands to the northeast contain a volcanic formation ranging in age from Miocene to Pliocene called the Masset Formation. Although widely separated from each other, all Pemberton Belt rocks are of similar age and have similar magma compositions. Therefore, these <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> are believed to be products of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Farallon Plate. By late Pliocene time the Farallon Plate had been greatly reduced in size and its northern portion ultimately broke off between five and seven million years ago to form a new plate boundary called the Nootka Fault. This rupture created the two small Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates that lie off the west coast of Vancouver Island.|$|E
50|$|The Variscan {{fracture}} zones {{were active}} {{during the entire}} Upper Cretaceous and decisively influenced the sedimentary facies distributions. This activity was further underlined by alkaline magmatism lasting from the Middle Albian {{until the end of}} the Coniacian; thus in the west of the North Pyrenean Zone, submarine basaltic lavas extruded, while farther east in the Béarn and in the Bigorre, different <b>magmatic</b> <b>rock</b> types intruded the Upper Cretaceous strata.|$|R

Examples of minerals found in the mine are the lithium-containing spodumene and amblygonite, caesium-containing pollucite, beryllium-containing beryl and tantalum- and niobium-containing simpsonite and tantalite.|$|R
