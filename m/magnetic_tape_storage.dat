50|$|Despite {{its major}} thrust as a retail backroom machine, {{it was still}} sold as a general purpose {{business}} computer, as it did support the common peripherals of the day such as video terminals, punched cards, printers and, later, disc and <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>storage</b> for sales, stock and accounting applications.
