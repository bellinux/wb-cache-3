2500|$|Sanders {{remained}} the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as [...] "the force {{and variety of}} his swearing" [...] when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as [...] "the Colonel's chicken". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that [...] "it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy" [...] but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him, he denounced it to the franchisee as [...] "God-damned slop" [...] or pushed it onto the floor. In 1973, Sanders sued Heublein Inc.—the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken—over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop.
