40|$|In {{numerical}} modelling {{of the resistance}} <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> process, a significant input parameter {{is the value of}} the weld current and traditionally, the rms value corresponding to the actual, instantaneous current waveform is used. The rms value implies a constant weld current for the entire weld time instead of the real-time current waveforms. Although the rms value represents an effective approximation of the real-time current waveform, the influence of the peak current and of the current slopes in each half cycle on the welding process cannot be realised in modelling when the rms value is used. Mathematically, an alternating current waveform with higher peak value and lower current on-time in each half cycle may correspond to a rms value that is nearly similar corresponding to another waveform with lower peak value and larger current on-time in each half cycle. The resulting rate of heating and the subsequent size of the weld nugget may not be the same for both the current signals since the resistive heating in resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> is transient in nature.

The influence of specific machine configurations {{is extremely difficult to}} predict starting from individual component specifications, and it has also been difficult in the past to accurately measure dynamic performance under typical operating conditions. This paper presents a reliable and very straightforward new method for the characterization of machine performance. This method has the advantage that {{it can be used to}} characterize the performance of RSW machines under realistic operating conditions. The test, the “Exploding Wire Test", uses a small diameter wire placed between the welding electrodes. The machines’ performance can subsequently be measured at the required operating load as the wire disintegrates when welding current is applied. This paper also describes the negative influence of the welding current itself on the machines’ mechanical behavior. The welding machines’ performance characteristics can be used directly, in order to optimize process operation towards a specific and demanding application, or serve as an input into an integrated mechanical / electrical / thermal model of the RSW process. The test method is relatively simple (although sophisticated instrumentation is required to accurately measure dynamic behaviour) and it can be used over a wide range, from micro-joining to heavy duty applications, and can be applied to projection welding as well as resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As máquinas de soldagem a resistência por ponto (Resistance <b>Spot</b> <b>Welding</b> RSW) são amplamente utilizadas pelas indústrias automobilísticas. Encontra-se disponível no mercado nas versões corrente alternada (CA) e corrente contínua a média frequência (MFDC). Na {{literatura}} técnica é possível encontrar estudos comparativos entre tais máquinas tendo como referência botão de solda, geometria do ponto, sua resistência mecânica e sua formação em chapas de aços revestidos e não revestidos. Entretanto, ainda resta estabelecer um comparativo entre as máquinas CA e MFDC do ponto de vista do uso energético das mesmas. Desta forma, o objetivo deste trabalho é realizar um estudo sobre a eficiência energética das máquinas CA e MFDC, dividindo em três partes de atuação. A primeira contempla o desenvolvimento de um modelo matemático para cada máquina. Em seguida, ambos os modelos são validados por meio de um planejamento fatorial 3 k, onde os fatores são a corrente e espessura da chapa. As respostas observadas foram o efeito na corrente do primário, que comparada com a corrente simulada validou os modelos matemáticos. A terceira fase trata da análise do rendimento, através de um planejamento composto central (PCC), onde os fatores foram o tempo, a força, a corrente e a espessura da chapa, e como resposta adotou-se os parâmetros rendimento elétrico e diâmetro do botão de solda. É possível concluir que a máquina CA apresentou melhor rendimento em relação à máquina MFDC, tendo como principal efeito as máquinas de soldagem a resistência por pontos. The resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> <b>machines</b> (RSW) {{are widely}} used by automobile industries. They are commercially available in two versions: alternating current (AC) and medium-frequency direct current (MFDC). In technical literature, {{it is possible to}} find comparative studies were with reference to button <b>weld,</b> <b>spot</b> geometry, mechanical strength and its formation in coated and uncoated steel plates. However, comparison between these machines, under {{the point of view of}} its energy use, still lacks. Thus, the aim of this work is to conduct a study on the energy efficiency of both AC and MFDC machines, splitting into three phases. The first one is the development of a mathematical model for each machine. Secondly, the two developed models were validated by using a factorial design 3 k, where the selected factors were welding current and plate thickness. The observed responses were the effect on the primary current, which compared with the simulated current validated the mathematical models. The third phase deals with the analysis of the electrical efficiency by using a central composite design (PCC), where the factors were time, power, current and plate thickness, and observed responses were the energy efficiency and the weld button diameter. It is possible to conclude that the AC machine showed better performance compared to the MFDC machine, whose main purpose <b>machines</b> for resistance <b>welding</b> points...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} second part of a {{research}} carried out by the authors on the application of ultrasonic metal <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> to lap joints made of AA 6022 -T 4 thin sheets. In particular, starting from the findings of Part 1, tensile–shear fatigue experiments are carried out on ultrasonically <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> lap joints both in single and double spot configurations. The analysis of consequent failure causes and modes and the application of traditional approaches for fatigue assessment of resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints allow then effectively predicting experimental evidences. Furthermore, an optimisation of the fatigue behaviour of double spot joints (longitudinal spots configuration) is achieved in terms of endurable load and distance between spots, with a possible generalisation to <b>multiple</b> <b>spot</b> configurations. Finally, a comparison of the fatigue performance of the ultrasonic technique to other spot joining techniques is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> {{is used to}} join two or more metal objects together, and the {{technique}} is in widespread use in, for example, the automotive and electrical industries. This paper discusses both the identification of different <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> processes and the process initialization parameters leading to highquality welding joints. In this research, self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used, and optimal features for the training parameters were sought. According to the results, processes can be classified by specific features. When introducing new data to trained SOMs, the welding operator can visually identify similar processes. After process identification, the most similar process is retrieved and a self-organizing map is trained for this specific process. The initialization parameters leading to successful welds in that process can thus be identified, {{which means that the}} manufacturers can use them to initialize their <b>welding</b> <b>machines.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} and manufacture of <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> equipments began in 1936. Three years later, KUKA already {{had more than}} 1,000 employees. After the major destruction of the company during the Second World War in 1945, KUKA started manufacturing <b>welding</b> <b>machines</b> and other small appliances again. With new products such as the double-cylinder circular knitting machine and the portable typewriter [...] "Princess", KUKA introduced new industrial fields and gained independence from the supply sector. In 1956, KUKA manufactured the first automatic welding system for refrigerators & washing machines and supplied the first multi-spot welding line to Volkswagen AG. Ten years later, the first friction <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> went into production. In 1967, the arc welding method was applied {{for the first time}} at KUKA. In 1971, the delivery of the first robotic welding system for the S-Class took place. A year later, the magnetic arc-welding machine came to the market.|$|R
