5|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{publicly}} introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after {{the use of}} a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax <b>master</b> <b>disc).</b> That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.|$|E
25|$|All SingStar games (except the {{original}} SingStar and Singalong with Disney for PlayStation 2) allow players to swap out the current disc (called the <b>master</b> <b>disc)</b> for another SingStar disc. This allows {{access to the}} songs on other versions without the need to reset the console; it also allows PS2 SingStar discs to be played on a PS3, regardless of its PS2 backwards compatibility status, by starting with a PS3 <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> When a new disc is swapped in, the game retains the functionality and appearance of the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> By starting with a new version, players can swap in their old SingStar disc and experience them with the functionality and cosmetics of the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E
25|$|Caruso {{died before}} the {{introduction}} of higher fidelity, electrical recording technology in 1925. All of his recordings were made using the acoustic process, which required the recording artist to sing into a metal horn or funnel which relayed sound directly to a <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> via a stylus. This process captured only a limited range of the overtones and nuances present in the singing voice. Caruso's 12-inch acoustic recordings were limited to a maximum duration of around four and one half minutes. Consequently, most of the selections that he recorded were limited to those that could be edited to fit this time constraint. Longer selections were occasionally issued on two or more record sides.|$|E

25|$|The stereo {{image was}} not made up of fully {{discrete}} Left and Right channels; each channel's signal {{coming out of the}} cartridge contained a small amount of the signal from the other channel, with more crosstalk at higher frequencies. High-quality disc cutting equipment was capable of making a <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> with 30–40dB of stereo separation at 1,000Hz, but the playback cartridges had lesser performance of about 20 to 30dB of separation at 1000Hz, with separation decreasing as frequency increased, such that at 12kHz the separation was about 10–15dB. A common modern view is that stereo isolation must be higher than this to achieve a proper stereo soundstage. However, in the 1950s the BBC determined in a series of tests that only 20–25dB is required for the impression of full stereo separation.|$|E
500|$|The game's year {{of release}} was officially {{announced}} at the 2015 PAX Prime event, with its release date set to be revealed at a special event the following year. Another announcement from that time was that Tabata was aiming for a simultaneous worldwide release, a first for the Final Fantasy series. This was later clarified by Tabata at the 2016 Taipei Game Show: Square Enix was aiming to release the game within {{the same time period}} across the world, although there might be minor variations depending on regions. The special event, called [...] "Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV", took place on March 30 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, hosted by internet celebrities Greg Miller and Tim Gettys. The event was livestreamed worldwide. Free limited tickets for the event were made available on February 5 for North American residents. By the next day, all tickets had been claimed. Its former release date, September 30, 2016, was announced {{on the first day of}} the event. According to Tabata, this release date was decided upon in 2013 based on projected development time and costs. In August, rumors began circulating that Final Fantasy XV had been delayed by two months. Tabata later confirmed that the game's worldwide release had been delayed to November 29: alongside the announcement was an official apology to fans for the delay. The reason he gave was that, while the game had reached fully playable form, the team was not satisfied with the overall quality they were aiming for, so the extra time would be dedicated to polishing XV further. In addition, he wanted to give players without an online connection the full experience without needing a Day One patch. Tabata confirmed in a later interview that he was the one who requested the extension after the <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> had been created for mass distribution. Patches following the initial release allowed support for the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X models, featuring enhanced graphics, resolution and framerate.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} several decades of disc record manufacturing, sound was {{recorded}} directly on to the [...] "master disc" [...] at the recording studio. From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> A record cutter would engrave the grooves into the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> Early versions of these master discs were soft wax, and later a harder lacquer was used. The mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{catalog number}} and stamper ID is written or stamped {{in the space}} between the groove in the {{lead-out}} on the <b>master</b> <b>disc,</b> resulting in visible recessed writing on the final version of a record.

[...] Due to a mixup in the duplication process, the modified version of the game was duplicated and not the original version. [...] Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation contacted Sony Computer Entertainment about the mix up, and eventually the discussions trickled down to Wiklem himself. [...] He told vice president of marketing Jeff Fox that he [...] "did send the right disc, it was properly labeled, and it’s not my fault that DADC couldn’t read." [...] The situation was put to rest shortly thereafter, with the decision being made not to make any further changes to the Greatest Hits disc.|$|E

2500|$|Technical faults in the {{majority}} of her original gramophone recordings (especially variations in recording speed, which raised or lowered the apparent pitch of her voice) misrepresented the [...] "light and shade" [...] of her phrasing, interpretation and delivery.

With direct metal mastering (DMM), the <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> is cut on a copper-coated disc, which can also have a minor [...] "orange peel" [...] effect on the disc itself. As this [...] "orange peel" [...] originates in the master rather than being introduced in the pressing stage, there is no ill effect as there is no physical distortion of the groove.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 September 2012, Sony Music Entertainment Japan {{announced}} [...] "Blu-spec CD2" [...] or BSCD2, {{a progression}} of the Blu-spec CD format which employs a more precise BD cutting machine, a <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> that is made from the same smooth material as silicon wafers for chip manufacture, and a different recording layer material for the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> Sony refers to this process as [...] "Phase Transition Mastering".|$|E
50|$|To further combat {{infringement}} {{of recorded}} works, the IFPI and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced Source Identification (SID) codes in 1994. The SID codes are markings on optical discs such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) that identify the manufacturer, equipment, and <b>master</b> <b>discs</b> {{used to create}} each disc. There are two codes: the SID mastering code and the SID mould code. The SID mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced. The SID mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded (replicated). Since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities {{have the ability to}} both produce <b>master</b> <b>discs</b> and replicate <b>discs,</b> the SID <b>mastering</b> code and SID mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility.|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} several decades of disc record manufacturing, sound was {{recorded}} directly on to the <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> (also called the matrix, sometimes just the master) at the recording studio.

50|$|Another {{improvement}} is noise reduction. The lacquer mastering method bears {{a higher risk}} of adding unwanted random noise to the recording, caused by the enclosure of small dust particles when spraying the silvering on the lacquer master, which is the necessary first step of the electroplating process for reproduction of the <b>master</b> <b>disc.</b> As the DMM <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> is already made of metal (copper), this step is not required, and its faults are avoided.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of DMM (hard surface material) over acetate lacquer cutting (soft surface material) are both sonic and practical: {{because of the}} rigidity of the <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> medium, no groove wall bounce-back effects take place after the cutting has been completed. This preserves the original modulation details in the groove walls much better, especially those involved with sudden fast attacks (transients). The improved transient response, {{as well as the}} more linear phase response of DMM improve the overall stability and depth-of-field in the stereo image. In addition, disturbing adjacent groove print-through sounds (groove echoes) are reduced in DMM. Also, {{there is no need to}} rush the finalized <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> directly into a refrigerator for groove preservation, as in conventional lacquer disc cutting, before processing the <b>master</b> <b>disc</b> to produce matrices for the pressing of the records.|$|E
