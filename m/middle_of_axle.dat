50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was based}} on the EMD FP9, lengthened to accommodate additional equipment, including a larger train heating steam boiler. Due to the additional weight of the added equipment and the weight restriction on the Park Avenue 97th Street Portal Viaduct, the locomotive was equipped with a three-axle rear truck, giving it an uncommon B-A1A wheel arrangement. The <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the rear truck was not powered. The Flexicoil type of truck was used at both front and rear, due to this type of truck having more room for fitting the third rail shoes and associated equipment.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to demonstrate a robotic wheelchair moving in an unknown environment with collision-avoidance navigation. A real-time path-planning algorithm was implemented by detecting the range to obstacles and by tracking specific light sources used as beacons. Infrared sensors were used for range sensing, and light-sensitive resistors were used to track the lights. To optimize the motion trajectory, it was necessary to modify the original motor controllers of the electrical wheelchair so that it could turn in a minimum turning radius of 28. 75 cm around its <b>middle</b> point <b>of</b> <b>axle.</b> Then, with these kinematics, the real-time path planning algorithm of the robotic wheelchair is simplified. In combination with the newly developed wireless Internet-connection capability, the robotic wheelchair will be able to navigate in an unknown environment. The experimental results presented in this thesis include the performance of the control system, the motion trajectory of the two driving wheels turning in a minimum radius, and the motion trajectory of the real-time path-planning in a real-life testing environment. These experimental results verified that the robotic wheelchair could move successfully in an unknown environment with collision-avoidance navigation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{trajectory}} tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot whose centroid doesn’t coincide to its rotation center i n the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> connecting <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> driving wheels. The nonholonomic dynamic model of the Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) is developed in global Cartesian coordinates where the WMR’s forward and angular velocities are used as internal state variables. In order to include the effects of parameter uncertainties, measurement noises and other anomalies in the WMR system, a bounded perturbation vector is embedded to the developed dynamical model. Through defining the control inputs by computed torque method, a Dynamic Sliding Mode Controller (DSMC) is proposed to stabilize the sliding surfaces. Based on the proposed robust control system, the effect of uncertainties and noises in the robot performance is attenuated. By use of the WMR forward and angular velocities as internal state vari ables in the dynamic modeling, the developed model is relatively simple and mainly independent of the robot states. This makes the dynamical model more robust against measurement errors. Design of the DSMC based on such a model leads to perfect trajectory tracking and compensation for initial off-tracks even {{in the presence of}} disturbances and modeling uncertainties. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractF 1 -ATPase is an ATP-driven rotary {{molecular}} motor {{in which the}} central γ-subunit rotates inside the cylinder made of α 3 β 3 subunits. The amino and carboxy termini of the γ-subunit form the axle, an α-helical coiled coil that deeply penetrates the stator cylinder. We previously truncated the axle step by step, starting with the longer carboxy terminus and then cutting both termini at the same levels, resulting in a slower yet considerably powerful rotation. Here we examine the role of each helix by truncating only the carboxy terminus by 25 – 40 amino-acid residues. Longer truncation impaired {{the stability of the}} motor complex severely: 40 deletions failed to yield rotating the complex. Up to 36 deletions, however, the mutants produced an apparent torque at nearly half of the wild-type torque, independent of truncation length. Time-averaged rotary speeds were low because of load-dependent stumbling at 120 ° intervals, even with saturating ATP. Comparison with our previous work indicates that half the normal torque is produced at the orifice of the stator. The very tip of the carboxy terminus adds the other half, whereas neither helix in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> contributes much to torque generation and the rapid progress of catalysis. None of the residues <b>of</b> the entire <b>axle</b> played a specific decisive role in rotation...|$|R

5000|$|Bulleid's {{decision}} to have three cylinders, all driving the <b>middle</b> coupled <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> his Merchant Navy and West Country / Battle of Britain classes, gave rise to several problems. As each cylinder was {{to have its own}} separate valve gear, this left very little space for the conventional inside set of motion. [...] This prompted Bulleid to design a new miniaturised Walschaerts motion that was compact enough to enclose the whole system in a casing. All three sets of valve gear were worked from an auxiliary three-throw crankshaft. A Morse inverted-tooth drive chain ran horizontally from a triple sprocket on the driving axle to an idler sprocket, from which a second chain ran downwards to the crankshaft. By the use of two chains the valve gear was isolated from the movement <b>of</b> the driving <b>axle</b> on its springs. The idler sprocket could be moved to give both chains the correct tension, but in practice only the vertical chain was adjusted.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA two-station [2]rotaxane, {{consisting}} of a dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 macrocycle which surrounds a molecular axle containing an anilinium and a mono-substituted pyridinium amide molecular stations, has been synthesized via the alkyne-azide "click chemistry". The subsequent N-benzylation of the triazole moiety, which {{is located in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the threaded <b>axle,</b> was then envisaged. In addition to affording a third molecular station (i. e. a triazolium station) for the macrocycle dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 (DB 24 C 8), {{it was found that the}} benzyl moiety behaves as a kinetic molecular barrier which prevents the DB 24 C 8 from shuttling along the molecular encircled axle from one extremity to the other. Depending on where the DB 24 C 8 is initially located, the N-benzylation of the triazole allows to trap the DB 24 C 8 either on the "left" or the "right" side of the thread with respect to the triazolium station. The presence of the benzyl barrier thus affords two different three-station [2]rotaxane molecular machines, in which some of co conformational states remain unbalanced and not at the equilibrium...|$|R

50|$|The Adler {{was built}} on a wooden {{framework}} which was covered with sheet metal. Both wet steam driven cylinders were placed horizontally inside the frame and drove the driving wheelset which {{was placed in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>axles.</b> The driving wheels had no wheel flange, so the locomotive could be operated on small radius curves. The forged spokes were rivetted to the rim. The original wheels were made of cast iron and were encircled with a forged tyre made of wrought iron. The original wheels made of brittle cast iron were replaced later through wheels made of wrought iron. The hollow spokes had a core made of wood to make them more flexible to cushion unevenness of the track. All wheels of the locomotive were unbraked. A mechanical railway brake braked both wheels of the tender on the right side where the fireman was located. There was a fixed connection between the locomotive and the tender. The buffers were made of wood. The horseshoe-shaped water box surrounded the coal stored in the tender. At first coke was burned in the firebox, later bituminous coal was used.|$|R

40|$|A multistate {{molecular}} dyad containing flavylium and viologen units was synthesized and the pH dependent thermodynamics of {{the network}} completely characterized {{by a variety of}} spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, UV-vis and stopped-flow. The flavylium cation is only stable at acidic pH values. Above pH ≈ 5 the hydration of the flavylium leads to the formation of the hemiketal followed by ring-opening tautomerization to give the cis-chalcone. Finally, this last species isomerizes to give the trans-chalcone. For the present system only the flavylium cation and the trans-chalcone species could be detected as being thermodynamically stable. The hemiketal and the cis-chalcone are kinetic intermediates with negligible concentrations at the equilibrium. All stable species {{of the network}} were found to form 1 [*]:[*] 1 and 2 [*]:[*] 1 host[*]:[*]guest complexes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB 7) with association constants in the ranges 10 (5) - 10 (8) M(- 1) and 10 (3) - 10 (4) M(- 1), respectively. The 1 [*]:[*] 1 complexes were particularly interesting to devise pH responsive bistable pseudorotaxanes: at basic pH values (≈ 12) the flavylium cation interconverts into the deprotonated trans-chalcone in a few minutes and under these conditions the CB 7 wheel was found to be located around the viologen unit. A decrease in pH to values around 1 regenerates the flavylium cation in seconds and the macrocycle is translocated to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axle.</b> On the other hand, if the pH is decreased to 6, the deprotonated trans-chalcone is neutralized to give a metastable species that evolves to the thermodynamically stable flavylium cation in ca. 20 hours. By taking advantage of the pH-dependent kinetics of the trans-chalcone/flavylium interconversion, spatiotemporal control of the molecular organization in pseudorotaxane systems can be achieved...|$|R
