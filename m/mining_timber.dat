Brick producers Midland Brick and Austral closed their kilns within the first week after the blast, and on 11 June, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry warned that 14% of local businesses could close. UnionsWA said thousands of workers were being stood down or made to take annual leave, and the secretary Dave Robinson said <b>mining,</b> <b>timber,</b> beef, pork, laundries and transport industries workers were worst affected.

25|$|The {{settlements}} at Economy remained economically successful {{until the}} late 19th century, producing many goods in their cotton and woolen factories, sawmill, tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. They also produced high quality silk for garments. Rapp's granddaughter, Gertrude, began the silk production in Economy {{on a small scale}} from 1826 to 1828, and later expanded. This was planned in New Harmony, but fulfilled when they arrived at Economy. The Harmonists were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. Because the group chose to adopt celibacy and their members grew older, more work gradually had to be hired out. As their membership declined, they stopped manufacturing operations, other than what they needed for themselves, and began to invest in other ventures such as the oil business, coal <b>mining,</b> <b>timber,</b> railroads, land development, and banking. The group invested {{in the construction of the}} Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, as well as the Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. The Society exerted a major influence on the economic development of Western Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|The first {{humans to}} live in the area, the Spokane people (their name meaning [...] "children of the sun" [...] in Salishan), arrived between 13,000 and 8,000 years ago, living off {{plentiful}} game. [...] David Thompson explored the area with the westward expansion and establishment of the North West Company's Spokane House in 1810. This trading post was the first long-term European settlement in Washington. Completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 brought settlers to the Spokane area, and that same year it was officially incorporated as a city with the name of [...] "Spokan Falls". In the late 19th century, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest. The local economy depended on <b>mining,</b> <b>timber,</b> and agriculture until the 1980s. Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World's Fair at Expo '74.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMine {{fires are}} the major {{disasters}} in process of coal production, and the <b>mine</b> <b>timbers</b> {{that can lead to}} fires are still significant hazard sources. For timber fires, thermal decomposition provides the necessary fuels for combustion in gas phase. To investigate the thermal decomposition kinetics of the <b>mine</b> <b>timber,</b> a typical timber is taken as experimental sample in this paper. TG and DTG techniques are carried out at different heating rates. Physical, chemical and thermal effect changes are analyzed according to the pyrolysis process. As temperature increases, the timber pyrolysis process shows four phases with varied physicochemical properties and heat effect. Two-phase and first-order thermal kinetic models for the decomposition of <b>mine</b> <b>timbers</b> are advanced, and the kinetic parameters are obtained. Those researches are benefit to understanding the ignition mechanism and flame spreading of timber fires in coal mines...|$|R

500|$|Horton Plains {{was a part}} of a large {{system of}} plains and forest cover that {{included}} Agra-Bopats, Moon Plains and Elk Plains. Between 1831 and 1948, it became a Sambar deer hunting ground. Elephants and Wild Boar were also hunted to a lesser extent. During this period lower slopes were cleared initially for coffee and then for tea plantations. As a result, Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness became isolated from other forest and grassland areas. Potatoes were cultivated in the grasslands but planting ceased in 1977. After being declared a National Park, these areas were reinstated as grasslands. Tourism-related issues such as plant removal, littering, fires and noise pollution are major conservation issues. Gem <b>mining,</b> <b>timber</b> logging, the collection of plants for ornamental and medicinal purposes, encroachment, poaching and vehicle traffic are the other threats. The spread of invasive alien species such as gorse (Ulex europaeus), [...] Mist Flower (Ageratina riparia), Crofton Weed (Ageratina adenophora), [...] (Austroeupatorium), Blue Stars (Aristea ecklonii), brackens, and Pennisetum spp. threaten the native flora. The introduced rainbow trout may have affected endemic species of fish, amphibia and crustaceans.|$|E
2500|$|For {{about two}} centuries, the Qing dynasty had enforced—albeit with mixed success—a policy of segregating the non-Han peoples [...] on the {{frontier}} from Han Chinese. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, however, China faced the prospect of being parcelled out among the Western powers and Japan, each competing for its own sphere of influence in the country. On the northern frontier, Russian Empire was viewed by the Qing court as posing the greatest threat to its territorial integrity. In response, the Qing government adopted a different policy, the [...] "New Administration" [...] or [...] "New Policies" [...] (Xin zheng), which called for the sinification of Mongolia through Chinese colonisation, the exploitation of Mongolia's natural resources (<b>mining,</b> <b>timber,</b> fishing), military training, and education.|$|E

50|$|Pitch pine {{is not a}} major timber tree due to the {{frequency}} of multiple or crooked trunks; nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of pitch and timber for ship building, <b>mine</b> <b>timbers,</b> and railroad ties because the wood's high resin content preserves it from decay. Pitch pine wood was also used for building radio towers in Germany, as at Muehlacker and Ismaning.|$|R

50|$|Coast Douglas-fir {{is one of}} the world's best timber {{producers}} and yields more timber than any other tree in North America. The wood is used for dimensional lumber, timbers, pilings, and plywood. Creosote treated pilings and decking are used in marine structures. The wood is also made into railroad ties, <b>mine</b> <b>timbers,</b> house logs, posts and poles, flooring, pulp, and furniture. Coast Douglas-fir is used extensively in landscaping. It is planted as a specimen tree or in mass screenings. It is also a popular Christmas tree.|$|R
50|$|As {{was common}} with the Comstock mines, the rock in the Ophir Mine was soft and easily {{collapsed}} into the working stopes (cavities where ore is extracted). In addition, the presence of clay that would swell greatly upon exposure to air caused great pressures that the <b>mine</b> <b>timbering</b> of that day could not hold back. The square set timbering method devised by Deideshimer slowed the swelling action long enough for ore extraction, though with time and decay the timbering was crushed by the enormous pressures found in the Comstock mines.|$|R
