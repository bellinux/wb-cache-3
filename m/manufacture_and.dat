5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Transport {{originally}} {{opened on}} May 11, 1985 as Avalanche Run and was entirely outdoors. It was built {{next to the}} beach, on the former spot of Jumbo Jet and later, WildCat.

5|$|Records from 1801 {{show that}} at that time {{agriculture}} was {{the main component of}} Puddletown's economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement agricultural income, though there were fewer opportunities for this after the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN <b>manufacture,</b> <b>and</b> the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E

5|$|Some {{nuclear safety}} {{agencies}} make recommendations {{about the use}} of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> disposal; the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.|$|E
5|$|The {{generators}} were {{manufactured by}} two joint ventures: {{one of them}} Alstom, ABB Group, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor; the other Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are air-cooled, which are simpler in design and <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> are easier to maintain.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> sale.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 in New York and in 2010 in Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice {{released}} an indictment against Treviño Morales for conspiracy to <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> distribute cocaine into the United States from Mexico and Guatemala. There was a bounty {{for him in}} Mexico set at $30 million MXN (US$2.3 million) and another one in the U.S. at US$5 million ($62.4 million MXN). Los Zetas {{are responsible for the}} smuggling of multiple tons of cocaine, marijuana, and heroin into the United States from Mexico annually. He was also considered one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> other {{nuclear physics}} {{applications}} {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E
