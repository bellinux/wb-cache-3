40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different ceramic surface treatments after machining grinding on the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of machinable dental ceramics with different crystalline phases. Materials and Methods: Disk-shape specimens (10 mm in diameter and 1. 3 mm in thickness) of machinable ceramic cores (two silica-based and one zirconia-based ceramics) were prepared. Each type of the ceramic surfaces was then randomly treated (n= 15) with different treatments as follows: 1) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> as control, 2) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and sandblasting with alumina, and 3) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and hydrofluoric acid etching for the leucite and lithium disilicate-based ceramics, and for the zirconia; 1) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and post-sintered as control, 2) <b>machined</b> <b>finish,</b> post-sintered, and sandblasting, and 3) <b>machined</b> <b>finish,</b> post-sintered, and Nd;YAG laser irradiation. The BFS were measured in a universal testing machine. Data based were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons post-hoc test (α= 0. 05). Results: The mean BFS of <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> only surfaces for leucite ceramic {{was significantly higher than}} that of sandblasted (P= 0. 001) and acid etched surfaces (P= 0. 005). A significantly lower BFS was found after sandblasting for lithium disilicate compared with that of other groups (P< 0. 05). Sandblasting significantly increased the BFS for the zirconia (P< 0. 05), but the BFS was significantly decreased after laser irradiation (P< 0. 05).     Conclusions: The BFS of the machinable ceramics was affected by the type of ceramic material and surface treatment method. Sandblasting with alumina was detrimental to the strength of only silica-based ceramics. Nd:YAG laser irradiation may lead to substantial strength degradation of zirconia.  </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMonitoring is an {{important}} issue for <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> the assembly interface of the large-scale component, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring security and reliability in the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> system. To overcome the interoperable problems caused by different proprietary interfaces and communication protocols, this paper proposes an MTConnect compliant monitoring system for acquisition and supervision of the pivotal data during the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process. The framework of the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> system is introduced at first, in which the main components and the workflow are described.

40|$|Optimization {{of cutting}} {{parameters}} {{is one of}} the most important elements in any process planning of metal parts. Economy of machining operation plays a key role in competitiveness in the market. All CNCmachines produce finished components from cylindrical bar. Finished profiles consist of straight turning, facing, taper and circular <b>machining.</b> <b>Finished</b> profile from a cylindrical bar is done in two stages, rough <b>machining</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> Numbers of passes are required for rough machining and single pass is required for the <b>finished</b> pass. The <b>machining</b> parameters in multipass turning are depth of cut, cutting speed and feed. The machining performance is measured by the minimum production time. In this paper the optimal machining parameters for continuous profile machining are determinedwith respect to the minimum production time, subject to a set of practical constraints, cutting force, power and dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Due to complexity of this machining optimizationproblem, a genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied to resolve the problem and the results obtained from GA and PSO are compared...|$|R
