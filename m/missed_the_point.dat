Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
25|$|There is no doubting the {{tremendous}} influence of Standonck {{at the time}} and the college founded was for centuries one of the most prestigious in the world, producing scholars and ardent reformers of all camps, including Béda, John Mair, Erasmus and later Calvin and Loyola. His form of reform—the education of exemplary clergy—was taken over in the Catholic Reformation but was rejected by the more radical reform demanded by Luther, Calvin and Knox, for whom personal mortification rather <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> The Catholic reformer Erasmus agreed. His judgement on Jan Standonk was that his intentions were good, but he lacked judgement. Erasmus's own judgement on the Collège de Montaigu was brutal indeed. Others—John Mair, for example—looked back on it with immense gratitude and respect.|$|E

Two months later, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Remembering the performance in Hull, folk singer Michael Chapman commented:The folkies did not take to him; [...] wanted songs with choruses. They completely <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! ...|$|E

500|$|After Harrison {{has named}} Rolling Stone {{as the main}} {{perpetrator}} of his anguish, Leng suggests that {{he is unable to}} sustain the previous [...] "artifice", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently [...] "happy" [...] private man versus the [...] "wounded" [...] musician, as [...] "personified by his guitar". Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought by now you knew the score / You <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as [...] "suggesting that there is more to Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists".|$|E

The group began its first European tour, a double headliner with the band Tad, at the Riverside venue in Newcastle upon Tyne on October 23, 1989. On December 3, they played a [...] "triumphant" [...] set at the London Astoria. Christopher Sandford related: [...] "when the style pundits noted Cobain's 'patent lumberjack shirts and ugly fifties geometric-patterned jerseys', seeing an example of 'low-couture chic' they <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that flannel shirts and sweaters were everyday dress in the marine climate of the Northwest".

[...] Blackmun would have held that in order to be entitled to relief, a death-sentenced inmate should {{have to be able to}} demonstrate that he is probably actually innocent; Blackmun distinguished this from the lower standard of probable reasonable doubt, which is applied to procedural default issues.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{lost the}} 1917 game by {{a score of}} 21 to 12. Northwestern scored first on a forward pass from Ellingwood to Arrles. [...] Michigan responded with a scoring drive capped by a three-year run by Gerald Froemke, but Elton Wieman <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> after {{touchdown}} (PAT), and Northwestern remained in the lead, 7-6. Northwestern scored again, on a short run by Koehler, and extended its lead to 14-6 at halftime. Northwestern scored again {{in the third period}} and led 21-6. In the fourth quarter, Froemke returned a punt 50 yards. [...] Michigan scored a touchdown to reduce Northwestern's lead to 21-12, though accounts differ as to whether the second Michigan touchdown was scored by Froemke or Wieman.|$|E

2500|$|The plot of Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{met with}} a mixed reception. Destructoid {{described}} it as [...] "dull" [...] and observed that it [...] "struggles to find a foothold because it spends far too long without an easily-identifiable conflict." [...] Andy Hartup of GamesRadar felt that the game lacked the nuance of previous installments, writing, [...] "There’s {{a general lack of}} subtlety and finesse to this game’s storytelling, and much of it feels like it <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> about what made the original trilogy such a success." [...] IGN remarked that the plot was sometimes derivative of prior games in the series, using the Remnant as an example, which they felt was simply another [...] "long-dead civilization that’s left advanced technology lying around". By contrast, VideoGamer.com listed the game's plot as a positive, likening it to a Hollywood hero story. Reflecting on his experience with the game, Polygons Arthur Gies wrote, [...] "The story in Andromeda is pretty good, with a number of mysteries on the critical path and some really interesting optional content." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Provost and Dean of Dickinson College, Neil Weissman, [...] {{responded to}} Robert Samuelson's rebuttal, in the 30 June 2007 Letter to the Editor, for the Washington Post, College Rankings Are Lame Science, {{in which he}} states, [...] "when Dickinson College chose not to {{participate}} in the U.S. News and World Report rankings of colleges, I imagined the decision would evoke some criticism, but never the charge Robert J. Samuelson made of 'anti-intellectualism' [...] 'Intellectual' to me means thoughtful. The problem with the U.S. News rankings is that they are not 'intellectual.' They are, as some higher education experts label them, lame science. Mr. Samuelson also <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in suggesting nonparticipating colleges are trying to censor U.S. News. The magazine is of course free to continue its rankings, as are others. We are simply saying that we will not participate in an exercise that, in our view, misleads prospective students more than it helps and drives up college costs by encouraging spending in pursuit of rankings on a fictional prestige ladder invented by U.S. News." ...|$|E
