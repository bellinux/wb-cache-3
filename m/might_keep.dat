5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the higher}} ranks of ōzeki and yokozuna, a wrestler will nearly always lose the rank {{immediately}} {{after having a}} make-koshi tournament (a losing record during a tournament). Very occasionally, however, a lucky sekiwake <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> his rank even with a 7–8 record {{if there are no}} obvious candidates to replace him, as when the komusubi and the upper maegashira have also had losing records. This has happened five times since the six-tournaments-a-year era began in 1958, most recently with Gōeidō in July 2013. In each case the wrestler was merely moved from the sekiwake East rank to the less prestigious West side.|$|E
25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we {{increase the number}} of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E
25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|E

500|$|The {{wives of}} those {{involved}} and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen. Several of the conspirators expressed worries {{about the safety of}} fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament {{on the day of the}} planned explosion. [...] Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel's name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> him from the chamber on that day.

500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] {{features}} several {{references to}} music, film, media, and other pop culture phenomena. The episode is structured similarly to the Breaking Bad episode [...] "4 Days Out". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote: [...] "'18 Miles Out' has a title that's {{very similar to}} '4 Days Out', {{one of the most}} memorable episodes of Breaking Bad, and a structure that's relatively similar: our two leads go on a long drive together for what should be a routine bit of business, have a lot of conversations about where they are at this point, and then hit a major obstacle that <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> them from driving home alive." [...] While driving in his car, Rick tells Shane of an incident with a close relative, who was sitting in blizzard-like conditions while listening to a narrative of Lord of the Rings. A scene towards the end of the episode contains the song Driver's Seat by rock band Sniff 'n' the Tears. In the concluding scene of [...] "18 Miles Out", the song [...] "Civilian" [...] by indie folk band Wye Oak can be heard playing in the background.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the conspirators}} {{expressed}} worries about fellow Catholics {{who would be}} caught up in the planned explosion; Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and when the young Earl of Arundel's name was mentioned Catesby suggested that a minor wound <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> him from the chamber on that day. Keyes's suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was, however, derided. On 26October William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton, warning him not to attend Parliament, and forecasting that [...] "they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them". Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to go hunting with James, but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle's servant. He immediately suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour. Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator, and threatened to [...] "hang him", but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, and the next day urged them to abandon the plot.|$|E

500|$|German Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf {{wrote about}} {{his visit to}} the monastery in Reise in den Orient in 1846 (translated as Travels in the East in 1847), without {{mentioning}} the manuscript. [...] Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during his first visit to the Saint Catherine's Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were [...] "rubbish which was to be destroyed by burning it in the ovens of the monastery", although this is firmly denied by the Monastery. After examination he realized that {{they were part of the}} Septuagint, written in an early Greek uncial script. He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the Septuagint. He asked if he <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited in the Leipzig University Library, where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them the 'Codex Friderico-Augustanus' (in honor of Frederick Augustus and keeping secret the source of the leaves). Other portions of the same codex remained in the monastery, containing all of Isaiah and 1 and 4 Maccabees.|$|E

Although he praised the graphics, animations, and the game's [...] "great personality," [...] he concluded, [...] "Blue Byte hasn't managed to find [...] new ideas that <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> the series from becoming the serious pool of stagnant gaming that it is quickly becoming." ...|$|E

He later wrote that [...] "My feeling, however, is that Asquith has no hope whatsoever of making such an arrangement and that his present idea is simply to let things drift in the meantime..

2500|$|In Argentina, {{normally}} {{only one}} family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, {{it is possible}} to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if Ana Laura Melachenko and Emanuel Darío Guerrero had a daughter named Adabel Anahí, her full name could be Adabel Anahí Guerrero Melachenko. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their birth family names instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining [...] "de" [...] and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> her birth name or become Paula Segovia de Cossia or Paula Cossia.|$|E
2500|$|When a [...] bombing {{took place}} in central {{district}} of Nijrab killed four French soldiers on June 2012, within France the bombing resonated deeply: while President Hollande had before indicated that he <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> some French troops {{in the country to}} help with the training mission, he later announced a full withdrawal by July. France being the fifth largest contributor to NATO's ISAF coalition, with nearly 3,300 soldiers, began its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in July and completed it {{by the end of the}} 2012. Kapisa transitioned to Afghan control in the third of a five-phase transfers. Withdrawing French troops by the end of 2012 had been one of Mr Hollande's election pledges. The date meant that French forces left the country two years before the main scheduled NATO pullout.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the courts}} of Europe, {{particularly}} Versailles and Whitehall in the 17th and 18th centuries, a mistress often wielded great power and influence. A king might have numerous mistresses, but have a single [...] "favourite mistress" [...] or [...] "official mistress" [...] (in French, maîtresse en titre), as with Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. The mistresses of both Louis XV (especially Madame de Pompadour) and Charles II were often considered to exert great influence over their lovers, the relationships being open secrets. Other than wealthy merchants and kings, Alexander VI is but {{one example of a}} Pope who kept mistresses. While the extremely wealthy <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> a mistress for life (as George II of England did with [...] "Mrs Howard", even after they were no longer romantically linked), such was not the case for most kept women.|$|E

2500|$|Game Revolution's Brian Gee {{awarded the}} game a C+.

Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [...] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty." [...] He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded [...] "Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability {{to live up to the}} hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth taking a look at, but its many problems just <b>might</b> <b>keep</b> it from a place in the collection." ...|$|E
