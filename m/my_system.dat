If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} <b>my</b> <b>system.</b> As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me.

Mein System {{is considered to be}} one of the most influential chess books of all time. It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas, while his second most influential work, Chess Praxis, elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games accompanied by his idiosyncratic, hyperbolic commentary which is often as entertaining as instructive.|$|E

25|$|SIP, more {{explicitly}} DNA/RNA-based SIP, uses stable-isotope enriched substrates, such as 13C, 15N, or H218O, and then analyzes the 'labeled' markers using species specific DNA or RNA markers. The analysis of labeled DNA is performed by separating unlabeled and labeled DNA on a cesium chloride gradient formed in an ultra centrifuge. Because all microbial organisms {{are capable of}} importing water into their cells, the use of H218O stable isotope probing is a very exciting new method that can shed light on questions microbial ecologists and biologists have struggled with answering for years, in particular, what are the active microbial organisms in <b>my</b> <b>system?</b> The H218O, or heavy water method will target all organisms that are actively growing, and induce little influence on growth itself. This would be especially true with most greenhouse experiments with arbuscular mycorrhizas because plants must be watered anyway, and water does not directly select for organisms with specific metabolic pathways, as would happen when using 13C and15N.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, the {{relation}} between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel {{that he was being}} denied due credit for his own [...] "first steps" [...] in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France {{in the aftermath of the}} Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion's decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the lettre he was offended by the fact that he himself was mentioned only twice, and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name [...] "Berenice". Young was further disheartened by the fact that Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion, and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the lettre Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion's decipherments merely as an extension of Åkerblad and Young's work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review, while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author's original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion, he complained that [...] "however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, I admit them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, not by any means as superseding <b>my</b> <b>system,</b> but as fully confirming and extending it."(p.146).|$|E

In 1977, Crews read the draft of a work by the philosopher Adolf Grünbaum that later became The Foundations of Psychoanalysis, and helped Grünbaum to obtain a publication offer from the University of California Press. Crews rejected psychoanalysis entirely in his article [...] "Analysis Terminable" [...] (first published in Commentary in July 1980 and reprinted in his collection Skeptical Engagements in 1986), citing what he considered its faulty methodology, its ineffectiveness as therapy, and the harm it caused to patients.|$|E

2500|$|The {{field of}} {{statistical}} mechanics (beginning {{with the work}} of Ludwig Boltzmann in developing the Boltzmann equation) relieved many physicists of this concern.

Microscopic kinetic fluctuations among particles cause entropic loss, and this energy is unavailable for work because these fluctuations occur randomly in all directions. [...] The anthropocentric act is taken, in the eyes of some physicists and engineers today, when someone draws a hypothetical boundary, in fact he says: [...] "This is <b>my</b> <b>system.</b> What occurs beyond it is surroundings." [...] In this context, exergy is sometimes described as an anthropocentric property, both by those who use it and those who don't.

40|$|Bioaugmentation for {{the removal}} of polyaromatic {{hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) from wastewater using bacteria and yeasts is considered environment-friendly and a cost-effective technique. The effectiveness of this biodegradation system depends on the stability of inoculated microorganisms and the availability of nutrients. This study is aimed to investigate the removal of high molecular weight (HMW) -PAHs from biologically treated produced water using different biological systems. Three systems, inoculated with activated sludge (AS), the mixture of five yeast strains (MY), and the mixture of AS and the five yeast strains (SY), respectively, were constructed, and their performance {{for the removal}} of HMW-PAHs was compared over 10 weeks. The effluent of the biologically treated produced water from an oilfield was used as the influent after chrysene and benzo(a) pyrene were spiked as HMW-PAHs. Polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques were used to examine the changes in the structures and abundances of the bacterial and yeast communities in these three systems. Only SY and <b>MY</b> <b>systems</b> were capable to remove chrysene (90. 7 % and 98. 5 %, respectively) and benzo(a) pyrene (80. 7 % and 95. 2 %, respectively). PCR-DGGE analysis confirmed that all of the five yeast strains inoculated remained in the SY and <b>MY</b> <b>systems,</b> while FISH results showed that the relative abundance of yeast in the SY and <b>MY</b> <b>systems</b> (10. 6 % to 21. 9 %, respectively) were significantly higher than AS system (2. 3 % to 7. 8 %, respectively). The relative abundances of the catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase (C 23 O) indicated that the copy number ratios of benzene ring cleavage gene C 23 O in the yeast amended systems were much higher than that in the AS system. In this study, all of the three systems were effective in removing the low molecular weight (LMW) -PAHs, while HMW-PAHs including chrysene and benzo(a) pyrene were efficiently removed by <b>MY</b> and SY <b>systems,</b> not by AS system. The high HMW-PAHs removal in the MY and SY bioaugmentation systems possibly attributed to the inoculation of the mixed yeast culture. By combining the PCR-DGGE results with the FISH analyses, it was found that yeast probably consisting mainly of the five inoculated strains inhabited in the two bioaugmentation systems as a dominant population. The relatively higher performance of the SY system might be attributed to the suspended growth type which permitted a more efficient contact between microbial cells and contaminants. The bioaugmentation <b>systems</b> (SY and <b>MY)</b> were successfully established by inoculating with five nonindigenous yeast strains and demonstrated high performance in removal of HMW-PAHs...|$|R
