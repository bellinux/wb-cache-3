30|$|Concrete is {{the most}} common {{building}} material used globally. The important processes of concrete production, such as materials <b>mixing,</b> <b>pumping,</b> transportation, injection, pouring, moulding and compaction, are based on the rheology of the materials. It is known that the rheology of cement paste has a strong impact on the properties of the concrete (Ferraris 1999). Various terms like flowability, mobility, workability and pumpability have been used to explain the rheology of concrete (Tattersall et al. 1983). However, it is generally agreed to define rheology in terms of yield stress and plastic viscosity (Banfill 2006). Various theoretical and empirical models have been developed to determine yield stress and plastic viscosity, however, these values are greatly dependent on model assumptions, rheometer specifications and accuracy of experimental data.|$|R

A resonant micropump-mixer is designed and fabricated, where an electrostatically activated plate is placed at or in close {{vicinity of the}} interface between the two incoming streams at the junction of a Y- or T-shaped microchannel.

40|$|Numerous {{recurrent}} situations following <b>mixing</b> and <b>pumping</b> of mortars and concretes cause {{degradation of}} fluidity and hardening characteristics. Which, in turn, lead to {{adverse effects on}} the quality of workmanship and structural defects. Nonetheless, relatively little research on the <b>mixing</b> and <b>pumping</b> energies used for the onsite transport and preparation of mortar or concrete has been directed at the core reasons or mechanisms for changes in technological properties. This dissertation describes and explains the effects of various <b>mixing</b> and <b>pumping</b> parameters on the mortar characteristics in a field trial and on a laboratory scale. Observations using a rheograph revealed that shearing action does exhibit the most pronounced influence on the characteristics of mortars during the pumping. The performed investigations indicate that higher shearing actions, for example, excessive mixing duration and long-distance pumping lead to reduced flowability, accelerated and increased hydration rate, increased early compressive strength and early-age shrinkage. From these findings, the underlying mechanism responsible for acceleration and increase of hydration rate is pinpointed as: the increased dissolution from the active surface area due to the destruction of the protective superficial layers of cement grains, as well as a transition from flocculation to dispersion. The creation of new surfaces leads to further consumption of active super plasticizer in solution phase and to subsequent degrading changes in fluidity (decreasing flowability). The degradation of fluidity and densification of microstructure provoked by the hydration changes do increase the early age shrinkage of mortar...|$|R
