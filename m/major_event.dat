5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>event</b> tourism, {{especially}} events {{centred on}} Catholicism, {{is an important}} segment of the Maltese tourism sector. During Holy Week, processions and religious services dominate the country and food stalls are {{set up in the}} village squares of Malta. Another popular <b>major</b> <b>event</b> is Carnival, a five centuries-old traditional celebration lasting for the five days preceding Ash Wednesday. Celebrations for Carnival involve float-based pageants, street parties and street food stalls. They are mostly Roman Catholic.|$|E

40|$|The {{lifestyle}} {{concept of}} Personal <b>Major</b> <b>Events</b> is proposed {{as a measure}} to predict an individual's reactions to retirement. The personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> of 44 retired professional men were categorized into the mutually-exclusive categories of work events, family events, and leisure events. Preliminary findings suggest a siginificant negative relationship be-tween the work proportion of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> and adjustment to and enjoyment of retirement. A significant positive relationship {{was found between the}} family proportion of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> and enjoyment of and prior attitudes to retirement. Implications of these findings suggest that the concept of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> is relevant for pre- retire-ment planners and as a research area in social gerontology.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of capital financing, {{taking into consideration}} unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events</b> occurring within continuous time model. We are considering a special jump-diffusion model first described by Samuelson (1973) while using traditional geometric Brownian motion. This paper seeks to accurately show the innovative project valuation when unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events</b> occur and get the analytical results of the project option value. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of multistaged financing; results indicated that both sources of uncertainty positively impact the project option value; particularly, the option price when considering unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events</b> occurrence {{is larger than the}} option price without unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events.</b> Based on a comparative-static analysis, new propositions for optimal amount of investment and optimal level of project are derived from simulations...|$|R

5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> by the local press and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible.

It also stimulated a further increase in record sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one <b>major</b> <b>event</b> took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|Regarded as a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> in British culture, {{the festival}} is {{inspired}} by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, {{with the number of}} attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} {{would go on}} for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E

5|$|The {{gathering}} of the dignitaries at the station and {{the departure of the}} trains was a <b>major</b> <b>event.</b> Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00am onwards the area around the station was filled with people, and crowds thronged the trackside at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of a chimney near the tunnel leading to Crown Street railway station; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after dawn to watch proceedings.|$|E

Special precautions were taken because many of the events were open to the public and there were multiple protectees. As means of assisting the motorcade, many streets were temporarily blocked off by law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The <b>major</b> <b>event</b> of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E

5|$|Darius's European {{expedition}} was a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> in his reign, {{which began}} with the invasion of Thrace. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, Paeonia, while Macedonia submitted voluntarily, after the demand of earth and water, becoming a vassal kingdom. He then left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to Sardis to spend the winter. The Greeks living in Asia Minor {{and some of the}} Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in Athens. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns amongst the Greeks over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by the Greeks in Ionia and Lydia were stepping stones towards the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> {{in the history}} of the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

They were later able to use their non-title victory to be granted a championship match, winning the Mexican National Trios Championship on June 23, 2003. Los Nuevo Infernales reign as champions lasted 96 days, until they were defeated by La Familia de Tijuana (Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario) on September 27, 2003. Averno and Mephisto turned on El Satánico shortly after the championship loss and formed their own group known as La Trada del Terror (the trio of terror) along with Ephesto, putting an end to Los Infernales just over a year after they won the rights to the name.|$|E
