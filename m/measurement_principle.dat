Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the universe, depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils have persisted for more than 22 years in superconducting [...] In such instruments, the <b>measurement</b> <b>principle</b> {{is based on the}} monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere of mass 4 grams.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} teacher use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> and the factors influencing this use in the assessment of student achievement in the Riftvalley Province (Kenya). Given that most of the assessment in the classroom consists of instruments developed by teachers, a first step in exploring the utility of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> is to investigate the use of these principles in specific assessment areas. This could lead to the determination and the improvement of the fit between measurement training and teacher classroom assessment practices. The study was designed to provide information on teacher use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> by considering whether teachers had received training in educational <b>measurement</b> <b>principles,</b> how important they perceived these principles to be, and how often they used the principles in the assessment of student achievement. The study was also designed to determine factors influencing the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> in schools. The results show that teachers have been trained in the <b>principles</b> of educational <b>measurement.</b> However, there is some indication that measurement training did not effectively address the assessment concerns of many classroom teachers. Teachers do not feel adequately prepared in test construction, marking, and the reporting of student assessment results. The results on the importance of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> provide some clear indication that teachers attach much importance to the principles for test construction, test administration, marking, and the reporting of student assessment results. Teacher interviews revealed that teachers are overwhelmed by the demands associated with Kenya's 8 - 4 - 4 system of education. On the basis of the study findings, suggestions were made for improving teacher training in measurement and for further research. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
