5|$|<b>Mediterranean</b> tropical-like cyclones, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>Mediterranean</b> hurricanes or medicanes, are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea. Due to the dry nature of the <b>Mediterranean</b> region, formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent, with only 99recorded tropical-like storms between 1948 and 2011. No agency, however, is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes. Tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea. The first region, encompassing areas of the western <b>Mediterranean,</b> is more conducive for development than the other, the Ionian Sea to the east. The rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general, and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form. Numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of global warming on <b>Mediterranean</b> tropical cyclone formation, generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would form.|$|E
5|$|People who eat a healthy, Japanese, or <b>Mediterranean</b> diet have a {{lower risk}} of AD. A <b>Mediterranean</b> diet may improve {{outcomes}} in those with the disease. Those who eat a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk. The <b>Mediterranean</b> diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.|$|E

Completing her <b>Mediterranean</b> service, she departed Malta on 29 November 1903, arriving at Plymouth on 10 December 1903.

5|$|A Book of <b>Mediterranean</b> Food was an {{influential}} cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950, her first, {{and published by}} John Lehmann. After years of rationing and wartime austerity, the book brought light and colour back to English cooking, with simple fresh ingredients, from David's experience of <b>Mediterranean</b> cooking while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by John Minton, and the chapters were introduced with quotations from famous writers.|$|E

50|$|The later {{migrants}} {{who reached}} Konkan speaking early Dravidian languages (see:Proto-Dravidian language) {{are believed to}} be the descendants of the <b>Mediterraneans.</b> Historians maintain that the paleo-Mediterraneans who came to India from north-west passes as early Dravidians formed a heterogeneous racial subtype. These <b>Mediterraneans</b> (or Dravidians as many historians call them) knew the craft of systematised agriculture, and inhabited most of neolithic India. The grammatical impact of the Dravidian languages on the structure and syntax of Indo-Aryan languages is difficult to fathom. Some linguists explain this anomaly by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan and New Indo-Aryan were built on a Dravidian substratum.Some examples of Konkani words of Dravidian origin are: naall (coconut), madval (washerman), choru (cooked rice) and mulo (radish). Linguists also suggest that the substratum of Marathi and Konkani is more closely related to Dravidian Kannada.|$|R
