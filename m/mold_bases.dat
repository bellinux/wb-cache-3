40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{a system to}} transfer <b>mold</b> <b>base</b> plates and standard parts faster during the stage of injection mold design. This system not only provides a way to compare the file version, but also it utilizes Siemens NX 10 to isolate the updated information into a single executable file (. dll), and then, the file can be transferred without the need of transferring the whole file. By this way, the system can help the user to download only necessary <b>mold</b> <b>base</b> plates and standard parts, and those parts downloaded are only the updated portions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Functionally graded mold (FGM) is {{the trend}} in the {{development}} of modern <b>mold.</b> <b>Based</b> on the optimization of electroforming and arc spray forming, a functionally graded mold with the structure of Ni-NiAl-ZnAl-Zn was manufactured, and the microstructure of the mold shell was analyzed. The experiments show that the manufacturing of functionally graded mold by electroforming and arc spray forming is feasible in engineering. The research is of significant value in exploring new manufacturing technology of functionally graded mold...|$|R
50|$|Molds are {{designed}} as two-plate or three-plate molds, {{depending on the}} type of component to be manufactured. The two plate mold requires a single day in light, while the three plate mold requires two days. Mold construction depends on the shape of the component, which determines the parting line selection, runner and gate selection and component ejection system selection. The <b>mold</b> <b>base</b> size depends on component size and number of cavities to be planned per mold.|$|R
50|$|The upper stories feature banded stonework, paired {{fenestration}} {{from the}} second through the fifth floors, and projecting, multi-story piers from the third through the fifth floors on <b>molded</b> <b>bases</b> and carved caps with egg-and-dart moldings. Paneled spandrels separate the third-through the fifth-floor fenestration, which contains one-over-one wood or steel sash. The sixth story displays pairs of round-arched windows with voussoirs that spring from molded bands and projecting keystones. The one-over-one sash appears {{to be made of}} wood.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{success and}} draw {{backs of the}} {{compression}} molding are well studied and reported {{but there is no}} enough studies or reports on injection molding. This study is on a comparison and evaluation of palatal adaptation of two different denture bases fabricated in two different palatal forms namely Shallow palate and Deep palate were used. Orientation notches (OrN) were made in the Master Model and were duplicated. 20 Shallow and 20 Deep palate cast were made. Denture bases were processed by Compression molding and Injection molding technique. The casts were trimmed in the PPS area and midline and the palatal adaptation was evaluated using vision measuring system. The results revealed that the mean palatal adaptation of injection <b>molding</b> denture <b>bases</b> was statistically significant when compared to compression <b>molding</b> denture <b>bases</b> in both the shallow palate and deep palate (p≤ 0. 05). But there was no statistical difference within the injection molding and compression <b>molding</b> denture <b>bases</b> in both palates (p≥ 0. 05). The Injection <b>molding</b> denture <b>bases</b> had better palatal adaptation. The material of choice and the technique of processing plays a major role than the shape of the vault in deciding the palatal adaptation of the denture...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a predictive model for the casting time in a ceramic slip-casting process. The predictive model was developed through a hierarchy of two fuzzy logic rule bases: one that predicts the condition of a <b>mold</b> <b>based</b> on the ambient temperature and humidity and the age of the mold, and one that predicts casting time based on the casting rate of the slip and the condition of the mold. This system is currently being implemented at a major sanitary ware manufacturing facility...|$|R
50|$|Sharp corners are {{problems}} with all <b>mold</b> <b>based</b> manufacturing, including casting. Specifically in transfer molding corners can break fibers {{that have been}} placed in the mold and can create voids on the inside of corners. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 3 on the right. The limiting factor in these designs is the inner corner radius. This inner radius limit varies depending on resin and fiber selection, but a rule of thumbs is the radius though be 3 to 5 times the laminate thickness.|$|R

50|$|An ingot is a {{piece of}} {{relatively}} pure material, usually metal, that is cast into a shape suitable for further processing. In steelmaking, it is the first step among semi-finished casting products. Ingots usually require a second procedure of shaping, such as cold/hot working, cutting, or milling to produce a useful final product. Non-metallic and semiconductor materials prepared in bulk form may also be referred to as ingots, particularly when cast by <b>mold</b> <b>based</b> methods. Precious metal ingots can be used as currency (with or without being processed into other shapes), or as a currency reserve, as with gold bars.|$|R
