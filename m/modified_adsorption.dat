40|$|Tension at {{the surface}} is a most {{fundamental}} physicochemical property of a liquid surface. The concept of surface tension has widespread implications in numerous natural, engineering and biomedical processes. Research to date has been largely focused on the liquid side; {{little attention has been}} paid to the vapor [...] the other side of the surface, despite over 100 years of study. However, the question remains as to whether the vapor plays any role, and to what extent it affects the surface tension of the liquid. Here we show a systematic study of the effect of vapor on the surface tension and in particular, a surprising observation that the vapor, not the liquid, plays a dominant role in determining the surface tension of a range of common volatile organic solutions. This is in stark contrast to results of common surfactants where the concentration in the liquid plays the major role.

The HCOOH oxidation {{has been used as}} a probe to determine the electrocatalytic. properties, of Pt(100) with different surface concentration of Cd or Ph adatoms. The results show that Cd adatonas on Pt(100) inhibit both HCOOH dissociation adsorption (to form poisoning intermediates) and HCOOH oxidation via the reactive intermediate, and that Pb adatoms on Pt (HO) inhibit only HCOOH d adsorption but catalyse HCOOH oxidation via the reactive intermediate(+) in this case the more Pb adaturns on Pt(100), the higher the catalytic effect. The highest (sic) catalytic effect has been found with the (sic) Pb adlayer on Pt(100) (the coverage of Pb, calibrated by hydrogen, adsorption, is then equal to 1. 0), i. e, with a surface structure of (sic) (2 x 2) -bridgeo Pb. The difference of influence to the hydrogen adsorption-desorption process and the different catalytic effect on HCOOH oxidation of Cd and Fb (sic) Pt(100) were attributed to the intrinsic properties of Cd And Pb elements and also to their interaction with Pt(100). This results indicate that the electrocatalytic mechanism of Cd and Pb datom on Pt(100) depends on the geometrical surface structure effect and, more importantly, on the electron structure effect during the interaction of adetoms with Pt(100) surface atoms...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{demographic}} change and better clinical diagnostic, the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease has increased worldwide. In Germany patients suffering from end-stage chronic kidney disease are usually treated with hemodialysis. However {{it is known that}} through this method the removal of protein-bound uremic toxins and middle molecules is limited. The uremic toxins remain in the patient’s blood and could develop their toxic potential. Therefore the development of new dialysis techniques with higher efficiency in elimination is essential. In order to achieve this, the use of adsorber techniques seems to offer great potential. Within the scope of this dissertation five patients with chronic kidney diseases were treated with a <b>modified</b> <b>adsorption</b> technique from Fresenius (the Prometheus®-system). Two adsorbers were used, which were cleaned after the treatment. The bound substances were isolated with different chromatographic methods and were analysed with electrospray ionizations mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). With the help of online databases, MassBank and Mascot, several mass spectras were identified. I identified 82 different substances with the database MassBank. 53 of those were bound to adsorber 1 and 35 to the adsorber 2. Six of the identified substances were bound to both adsorbers. Furthermore one more substance could be identified with the database Mascot. Together these 83 substances formed a very heterogeneous mixture of substances. Five uremic toxins (creatinine, indole- 3 -acetic acid, kynurenine, spermine and Interleukin- 6) were detected among them. However the biggest part consisted of therapeutic metabolites (39 substances), which were mainly drugs. The gained knowledge that in addition to the urinary excreted substances and the uremic toxins the therapeutic metabolites also bind to the adsorbers is really important for the intended use. At the moment it is difficult to say to what extent this knowledge will affect the treatment. Therefore, the quantitative determination of the identified substances as well as the identification of previously unrecognized samples needs to be addressed in future researchs. In conclusion, a lot of different substances bind to the adsorbers. Whether this could lead to a limitation for the intended use as a treatment on chronic kidney disease stays the subject of current research...|$|E

40|$|The {{variety and}} {{complexity}} of potentially-related data resources available for querying [...] - webpages, databases, data warehouses [...] - has been growing ever more rapidly. There is a growing need to pose integrative queries across multiple such sources, exploiting foreign keys and other means of interlinking data to merge information from diverse sources. This has traditionally {{been the focus of}} research within Information Extraction (IE) and Information Integration (II) communities, with IE focusing on converting unstructured sources into structured sources, and II focusing on providing a unified view of diverse structured data sources. However, most of the current IE and II methods, which can potentially be applied to the pro blem of integration across sources, require large amounts of human supervision, often in the form of annotated data. This need for extensive supervision makes existing methods expensive to deploy and difficult to maintain. In this thesis, we develop techniques that generalize from limited human input, via weakly-supervised methods for IE and II. In particular, we argue that graph-based representation of data and learning over such graphs can result in effective and scalable methods for large-scale Information Extraction and Integration. Within IE, we focus on the problem of assigning semantic classes to entities. First we develop a context pattern induction method to extend small initial entity lists of various semantic classes. We also demonstrate that features derived from such extended entity lists can significantly improve performance of state-of-the-art discriminative taggers. The output of pattern-based class-instance extractors is often high-precision and low-recall in nature, which is inadequate for many real world applications. We use Adsorption, a graph based label propagation algorithm, to significantly increase recall of an initial high-precision, low-recall pattern-based extractor by combining evidences from unstructured and structured text corpora. Building on Adsorption, we propose a new label propagation algorithm, <b>Modified</b> <b>Adsorption</b> (MAD), and demonstrate its effectiveness on various real-world datasets. Additionally, we also show how class-instance acquisition performance in the graph-based SSL setting can be improved by incorporating additional semantic constraints available in independently developed knowledge bases. Within Information Integration, we develop a novel system, Q, which draws ideas from machine learning and databases to help a non-expert user construct data-integrating queries based on keywords (across databases) and interactive feedback on answers. We also present an information need-driven strategy for automatically incorporating new sources and their information in Q. We also demonstrate that Q 2 ̆ 7 s learning strategy is highly effective in combining the outputs of "black box 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 schema matchers and in re-weighting bad alignments.

40|$|The {{surface tension}} of an {{interface}} separating two bulk phases {{is one of}} the most widely studied properties in surface science research. The importance of surface or interfacial tension is reflected in the diverse number of applications which are influenced by surface tension related effects. This thesis represents a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation on molecular adsorption and surface tension from a class of organic compounds in aqueous solutions. The research illustrates the effect of both liquid and vapor phase adsorption on the interfacial properties. Adsorption from both sides of the vapor/liquid interface is considered simultaneously rather than exclusive of one another, which has been the conventional practice. In the experimental study, the surface tension of a number of different volatile organic compounds is measured using the Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis-Profile (ADSA-P) method. The experiments were performed in a controlled environment under conditions where the surface tension can be affected by both vapor and liquid phase adsorption. The vapor phase was exerted by the presence of an environment solution containing the same organic component as in the drop solution. The results show that initially the surface tension is influenced by the organic concentration in both the liquid and the vapor phase. At the final steady-state the liquid phase becomes less important and the primary factor influencing the surface tension is the vapor phase concentration. The ADSA-P technique is verified by reproducing a select number of cases using the Wilhelmy plate method. A possible consequence of the surface tension phenomenon is illustrated through time-dependent contact angle experiments. The behavior of the interface at steady-state conditions is investigated by measuring the surface tension response to a change in drop volume. It is concluded that the organic compounds considered in the current study may represent a rather general group of molecules whose surface behavior is unique to that of many conventional surfactants. In the theoretical study an empirical model is proposed to describe the relation between the steady-state surface tension and the concentration of the environment and drop solutions. The results confirm the experimental observation that the final steady-state surface tension is determined primarily by the organic concentration in the vapor phase. In addition, a <b>modified</b> <b>adsorption</b> isotherm is developed to account for simultaneous adsorption from both sides of the vapor/liquid interface at steady-state conditions. The derivation is based upon the classic Langmuir analysis, and the new equation is consistent with the Langmuir isotherm under traditional conditions where adsorption occurs from one side of the interface. The modified isotherm is shown to be consistent with the experimental data and is used to generate the equilibrium parameters for three of the systems studied in this research. The adsorption isotherm is then extended to model the dynamic adsorption process through the creation of a new kinetic transfer equation. As with the adsorption isotherm, the transfer equation is based on Langmuir kinetics and is capable of simulating adsorption from both sides of the interface during surface equilibration. The kinetic transfer equation is validated against experimental data from two systems which exhibit a transfer-controlled adsorption mechanism. The theoretical predictions from the transfer equation fit well with the experimental data for both systems. However, significant variability is observed in the least squares estimates of the kinetic rate constants. The variability is attributed to the limitations of empirical models that utilize adjustable fitting parameters to optimize the model predictions, and the wide range of surfactant concentrations studied. Specific concentration regions are identified where the variability in the rate constants is minimal and thus, where the model is most appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{is seen as}} one of {{the major}} global {{contributors}} to global warming. CO 2 is produced naturally in the environment, however, with the advent of climate change, CO 2 emissions from manmade sources has come under scrutiny as a driver of manmade climate change. Combustion of fossil fuels and related practices is seen as the primary source of such emissions. Current CO 2 capture technologies tend to be limited by cost and effectiveness. The basis of this project was to design a novel adsorbent material capable of removing significant levels of CO 2 from gaseous streams. As a fundamental requirement, the developed adsorbent material was synthesised using economically viable materials, such as amine modified microporous zeolites which have not been extensively studied to date compared to amine modified mesoporous solids such as SBA- 15. This study looks primarily at CO 2 adsorption from low temperature exhaust streams with two primary factors of interest; CO 2 adsorption capacity and regeneration energy requirements. Various microporous solids, including zeolite-Y and zeolite-, were chosen with the view of examining their potential as supports for liquid amine. A number of techniques were employed for surface modification and subsequently tested using a gas adsorption rig with online mass spectrometry. The most successful technique for synthesising amine <b>modified</b> <b>adsorption,</b> which showed preferable properties in terms of CO 2 adsorption and regeneration, was chosen for further testing. The solid which performed best during CO 2 adsorption/desorption testing was aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified zeolite - 25, prepared using a amine solution impregnation technique whereby APTES was dissolved in toluene, zeolite- was then added to the mixture and subsequently heat treated. This solid was found to have a CO 2 adsorption capacity of 216 mg CO 2 g- 1 solid adsorbent. Other factors investigated included the effects of silica-alumina ratios on amine functionalisation, the effects of surface pre-treatments, such as acid treatment, in boosting surface modification and finally, the use of alternative amines to modify microporous solids. These tests showed that with decreasing silica/alumina ratio the adsorption capacity of each solid similarly decreased. Dilute acid pre-treatment was found to boost surface hydroxyl groups for subsequent amine bonding in some samples. The weight percentage amine loading of solid supports was also found to be an important factor as too much amine was found to be detrimental to the CO 2 adsorption properties. A number of amine modified mesoporous materials were also prepared for comparative purposes. APTES, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) were used to modify a number of MCM-type mesoporous silicas. MCM- 41 and porous silica spheres were synthesised for this investigation. The TEPA modified MCM- 41 samples produced an adsorbent with the most favourable CO 2 adsorption/desorption properties. The adsorption capacities obtained were up to 196 mg CO 2 g- 1 for modified MCM- 41 with desorption occurring at temperatures as low as 75 °C. Co-condensed silicas were prepared by incorporating aminosilanes into the synthesis mixtures in order to synthesise MCM-type materials with a homogeneous distribution of functional amines on the solids surface. CO 2 TPD studies showed that the adsorption capacity of the 15 % TRI amino silane co-condensed spheres was found to be 65 mg CO 2 g- 1. This sample was subsequently exposed to secondary post synthesis modification. This sample achieved a CO 2 adsorption capacity of 211. 3 mg CO 2 g- 1 sorbent. The amine cocondensed solids showed promising results as both supports and adsorbents for CO 2 capture. Solid characterisation was carried out using N 2 adsorption isotherm analysis to establish the surface area and pore sizes. The morphologies of the silica supports were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The organic contents of solid adsorbents were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and C. H. N. elemental analysis. The two most adsorbent samples were examined using CO 2 adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies. These were used to show the effects of flue gas parameters on the CO 2 adsorption properties of APTES and TEPA modified solid supports. CO 2 partial pressure, exhaust temperature and exhaust constituents such as moisture and other flue gases can impact on the CO 2 adsorption characteristics of the amine modified adsorbent. The adsorption isotherms for each sample follow the assumptions of the Langmuir model which suggests that there are a fixed amount of adsorption sites which CO 2 can interact with during the adsorption process. Qst values of 131 kJ mol- 1 and 161 kJ mol- 1 were obtained for 40 % TEPA/MCM 41 (R) EtOH and APTES/N - 25 (WI) Tol, respectively. The findings of this thesis clearly demonstrate that amine modified zeolites show significant potential as an alternative adsorbent in the removal of CO 2 from flue gas streams when compared with more expensive mesoporous materials...|$|E

On the contrary, the presence of the nitrogen atom in the nicotinyl ring affects deeply the mechanism of hydrogenation by favoring the accumulation of tetrahydropyridine intermediate in the liquid phase, which is probably caused by <b>modifying</b> the <b>adsorption</b> mode on the metallic surface. It was demonstrated that data provided by examining corresponding IR stack plots by employing a chemometric, self-modeling curve resolution algorithm are more reliable than data derived from off-line GC analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at modifying ceramic {{membranes}} {{by means}} of alcohol chemisorption. Composite ceramic membranes with a skin layer of -alumina were used. First, the adsorption of several alcohol on powdered -alumina was investigated emphasising the thermal stability of the adsorbed compounds. Later, a commercial -alumina membrane was <b>modified</b> by alcohol <b>adsorption.</b> The permeability of water and several organic compounds was obtained for both the non-modified and modified ceramic membrane. Also, its isoelectric point was determined. The results prove that all the alcohol were readily adsorbed on powdered -alumina not only physically but also chemically forming an alkoxide. The chemisorbed alcohol was stable up to 200 ◦C. Beyond this temperature, the alkoxide breaks up releasing the alcohol although the alkoxide also can react yielding an olefin or ether. The ceramic membrane was also successfully <b>modified</b> by alcohol <b>adsorption.</b> The layer of chemisorbed alcohol imparts hydrophobic characteristics to the membrane surface, so water permeability decreases significantly. This cannot be merely explained by pore size reduction due to the adsorbed layer. Thermal treatment at 250 ◦C recovered original permeability with only minor damage to the membrane. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} copper {{manganese}} oxides doped with transition metal oxides were prepared by co-precipitation using copper acetate and manganese acetate as precursors, ammonium bicarbonate as precipitant, and metal nitrates as dopants. The catalysts {{were characterized by}} N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray powder diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results showed that doping transition metal oxides into copper manganese oxides can <b>modify</b> the CO <b>adsorption</b> ability of the catalyst and thus affect the catalytic oxidation of CO...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies {{against the}} major {{cysteine}} proteinase (cruzipain) from Trypanosoma cruzi were detected in human sera obtained from {{patients with chronic}} Chagas' disease. Not only the intact 60 -kDa enzyme but also its 25 -kDa self-proteolysis fragment are antigenic in vivo. Although T. cruzi antigens 13 and 36 also reacted with the apparently monospecific antiproteinase serum, the antigenicity of cruzipain to human patients is genuine, since its reactivity was not <b>modified</b> by the <b>adsorption</b> of human sera with the recombinant proteins 13 and 36...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy (STM) experiments {{combined with}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that deposited Cr atoms replace either Na or Cl ions, forming substituting dopants in ultrathin NaCl/Au(111) films. The Cr dopants exchange electrons {{with the support}} thus changing the electronic properties of the film {{and in particular the}} work function. The Cr atoms spontaneously aggregate near the edges of the bilayer (2 L) NaCl islands, forming a new phase in the insulator with a remarkably dense population of Cr dopants. The spectra of differential conductance yield evidence that, compared to the undoped or Cr-poor 2 L NaCl films on Au(111), the Cr-rich region shows different interface state, shifted image-potential states, and a reduced work function. This demonstrates the potential of doping ultrathin films to <b>modify</b> their <b>adsorption</b> properties in a desired manner. status: publishe...|$|R
