40|$|This {{investigation}} {{considers the}} freeze/thaw durability characteristics of concrete produced {{with the addition}} of polypropylene fibres and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). Previous work [Richardson 2005] has shown <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibres</b> to be instrumental in maintaining the integrity of early life concrete when subject to freeze/thaw cycles. This work expands upon the earlier data collection by introducing a bye product (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement. The test methodology allows comparisons to be drawn between fibre and non fibre concretes with and without GGBS. Concrete cubes cured to four days were subjected to a maximum of 50 freeze/thaw cycles.

40|$|This paper makes a {{comparison}} between the electrical properties of cement grout with and without <b>monofilament</b> polypropylene <b>fibre</b> additions. The findings show a small, but {{significant difference between the}} electrolytic transport properties of cement grout with <b>monofilament</b> polypropylene <b>fibre</b> additions when compared to grout without fibre additions. The grout with fibre additions suggests a reduced probability of water and ion transmission, due to higher measured resistivity, which will result in enhanced durability and lower life cycle costs. Durability of reinforced concrete structures, is known to be closely linked to the water permeability of the concrete matrix. This potential trend for enhanced durability can be added to the other benefits of using <b>monofilament</b> polypropylene <b>fibre</b> in concrete, such as low absorption, freeze/thaw resistance, fire resistance and micro reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the molecular {{design of a}} speciality polyester {{for use as a}} fast-absorbable monofilament surgical suture. In the surgical context, “fast-absorbable ” means tensile strength loss within a period of 10 - 14 days, the minimum period required for secure wound approximation, after which the suture gradually loses its mass integrity leading to complete mass loss within 2 - 3 months. In order to be fast-absorbable, it is necessary that the main monomer used in synthesizing the polymer is glycolide since the polymer repeating unit,-OCH 2 CO-, is the chemical structure which hydrolyses the most rapidly in the human body. However, glycolide alone would give a <b>monofilament</b> suture <b>fibre</b> which would be too stiff and unwieldy for practical purposes and so it needs to be copolymerised with other cyclic ester monomers such as L-lactide and caprolactone to modify its mechanical properties. In this way, a <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibre</b> can be obtained which has an appropriate balance of hydrolysability and flexibility. Thus, this work enters the realm of “molecular engineering ” insofar that it involves the strict control of both the chemical and physical microstructure of the polymer during the synthesis and processing steps respectively. This paper will describe how this controlled molecular architecture can be achieved and some preliminary results will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Relief {{structures}} are created {{on the surface}} of fibres to generate new effects in these fibres. More specifically, photo-embossing is used to generate the relief structures and to generate a non-contact process without etching procedures which could eventually be applied in high-speed and continuous spinning lines. Typically, a photopolymer mixture consisting of a polymeric binder, a monomer and a photo-initiator is directly spun into a <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibre.</b> The rheological properties of the photopolymer mixture are measured, and it is shown that the photopolymer mixture is visco-elastic at elevated temperatures. Fibres are prepared from the photopolymer mixture, and surface relief {{structures are}} generated perpendicular to the fibre axis by photo-embossing using a mask exposure. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to study the surface morphology of the fibres. It is shown that the height of the surface relief structures is strongly dependent on the pitch of the line mask and on the diameter of the fibres. At optimized conditions, patterned fibres are produced with well-defined surface relief structures.

At introductory chapters there is given a more general summarisation of knowledge and experience gained from literature and own experiments. As analysed at chapter No. 2, theoretical derivation of properties of short fibre composites with omnidirectional orientation of fibres is very complicated. That is why experimental processes are still used to examine their final mechanic-physical properties. At the paper, the experimental program dealing with an influence of a few factors, such a dosage and type of fibres, treatment of test speciments and speed of loading on final properties of the composite, is presented in more details. An influence ot two types of short PP fibres (length 12 mm) on properties of fine-grained cement mortar is followed. Thin <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibres</b> (T) are compared with thicker foil fibrillated fibres (F). Especially their influence on energy of rupture is analysed in more details. In the frame of suggested experimental program, possibilities of measuring and evaluation of energy of rupture not only from deflection of specimens according to RILEM draft but also from crack opening (CMOD method) were verified successfully.

Recently, the use of cellulosic fibre fabrics and their fabric reinforced polymer composites as reinforcement materials within and/or outside of construction materials (e. g. concrete) has gained popularity due to their inexpensive cost and favourable specific mechanical properties compared with synthetic fibre fabrics (e. g.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{composites}} of polymers reinforced with natural fibres have received increasing attention, {{both from the}} academic world and from several industries. There is {{a wide range of}} natural fibres which can be applied as reinforcements or fillers thanks to their properties and availability; i. e. flax, hemp, jute, kenaf and sisal. Natural fibres are mainly attractive for the following reasons: specific properties, price, health advantages and recyclability. Particularly, industry is getting more and more interested in environment-friendly products and therefore the research on natural fibre based on composite materials is gaining importance. Some of the benefits linked to the usage of such natural composites are their low density and good specific properties. Furthermore, they are renewable and have a CO 2 -neutral life cycle, in contrast with their synthetic opponents (i. e. glass and carbon). Despite such good premises, these fibres have also some negative characteristics: they are highly hydrophilic and their properties may vary in time. The natural fibres have a complex structure of elementary fibres, consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and others and thus they should not be considered as <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibres.</b> Mechanical, physical and even chemical properties of these fibres are strongly harvest-dependent, influenced by climate, location, soil characteristics, and weather circumstances. They are affected also by fibre processing (i. e. retting, scutching, bleaching, spinning) and by their incorporation into composites: handling, impregnation and consolidation may introduce supplementary changes. Obviously, such variability complicates the prediction and the evaluation of the composite properties. Another known problem in natural fibre reinforced composites is the poor interface quality between the fibres and the polymer matrix; chemical pre-treatments are often applied in order to enhance the adhesion between these components,. In the last few years several new components based on natural fibre composites have been mainly developed by industries in the automotive field; i. e. in 2003 around 43, 000 tonnes of natural fibre have been used by the European automotive industry as composite reinforcement. This interest is due to the excellent tensile mechanical properties of fibre obtained from plants such as flax, hemp and the stinging nettle. Other main applications of the natural fibres are in the following fields: nautical and biomedical ones. The aim of this work is to present a review on the main natural fibres investigated by researchers and to report the results of some original studies performed by the Authors...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>monofilament</b> macro-synthetic <b>fibres</b> in wet-mix {{shotcrete}} applications {{has grown}} significantly worldwide since their introduction {{in the late}} 90 ’s. As opposed to the stiffer steel fibres, which have to be used at relatively short lengths (30 mm) to reduce line blockage, the more flexible macro-synthetic fibres can typically be used, in well proportioned wet-mix shotcrete mixtures, at lengths ranging from 50 to 100 mm, without significantly reducing the pumpability and shootability of the mixture. Other reported benefits of macro-synthetic fibres over steel fibres in wet-mix shotcrete include reduced equipment wear and fibre rebound, and increased shotcrete layer built-up thickness. However, attempts to date to incorporate macro-synthetic fibres in dry-mix shotcrete have failed for numerous technical reasons.

40|$|The sensors {{commonly}} used today to measure human physiological parameters are hard and discrete and {{not suitable for}} long term monitoring. A wearable garment with integrated fabric sensors incorporated in an unobtrusive way is highly desirable for long term physiological monitoring, particularly in a non-clinical environment. The aim of this work is to investigate fabric sensors which can be integrated into a garment to allow the unobtrusive monitoring of physiological parameters, primarily for measuring the electrocardiograph (ECG) and respiration. The work focuses on using only dry fabric electrodes where skin preparation {{and the use of}} chemical gels or adhesives are not employed. The textile structure used in {{this study was designed to}} provide controlled contact pressure, enable construction using common textile processing methods, allow accurate placement of electrodes on the body, allow comfortable fit and be unobtrusive to wear. It was decided to use the knitting method to make bands which incorporated conductive electrodes in order to evaluate different fabric electrodes materials. The detection of respiration using fabric strain sensors did not require electrical contact with the skin. Preliminary experiments were conducted on a single subject to develop a device and methodology. Galvanic skin response and ECG was initially investigated to determine the effectiveness of electrode materials. ECG was established as a more reliable measure and was subsequently used to evaluate the initial performance of the fabric electrodes, and further refine the test methodology on a single subject. Experiments were then conducted on 10 male volunteer participants of reasonable general health having no known heart conditions, with ages 30 - 55 and BMI 20 - 30. It was found that fabric sensors which were soft, pliable and flexible have advantages in terms of ability to provide better quality ECG signals and a comfortable bio-interface. Variation in the pressure applied to the electrode directly affects the acquired signal level and a pressure of 2. 5 KPa is preferred. Multifilament conductive yarns are more easily processed into fabric than monofilament yarns and are generally preferred. Electrodes comprising a conductive polymer treated fabric gave better performance than metal or metal coated yarns. Fabric strain sensors were tested and used to detect respiration on a single subject. It was found that human respiration can be measured using strain sensors such as those comprised of a conductive polymer treated fabric or a fabric incorporating a rigid conductive <b>monofilament</b> <b>fibre...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{original work}} towards the successful formation of novel thermochromic composite fibres through melt extrusion processes, and whose major application includes incorporation into wound dressings and garments, for the thermal mapping of chronic wound bed surfaces and skin surfaces, within the physiological temperature range. Specifically, this work {{focuses on the}} incorporation of thermochromic liquid crystalline (TLC) mixtures into host materials in fibre form, such that clear and reliable thermochromic behaviour is preserved, and a good colour density is maintained. TLC mixtures containing both sterol based, and non-sterol based compounds were used. The relationship between composition and thermochromic behaviour for binary and ternary TLC mixtures consisting of a selection of cholesterol derivatives is also explored in this work. Crucial {{to the success of}} the TLC containing composite fibres was the insertion of a black core material through the centre of the fibres, addressing the inherent need for TLCs to be viewed against a black or dark background for their reflected colours to be visible. Two major methods of incorporation of the TLC into a host fibre were presented using melt extrusion processes. The most successful <b>monofilament</b> composite <b>fibre’s</b> thermochromic behaviour was found to be clear, and comparable to that of unincorporated TLC mixtures. The thermochromic behaviour was found to remain stable after storage in air for at least 17 weeks, provided that the fibres were not also exposed to light. Their behaviour also remained stable upon submersion in water and saline solution, for at least 10 days. The inherent instability of TLCs to light induced degradation was unfortunately found to be preserved in these fibres, where a detrimental shift in the thermochromic behaviour of the fibres occurred with intense or long-term exposure to UV light. Methods of avoiding or slowing light induced degradation are discussed. This thesis focuses on the steps taken towards achieving the final successful fibre design, as well as its characterisation, and discussions in regards to its applicability to medical applications...|$|R

This is a retrospective review of 34 consecutive patients who suffered orbital trauma from August 2007 to March 2013 treated with a partially absorbable mesh for orbital reconstruction. Data collected included gender, age, nationality, cause of injury, date of admission, date of surgery, date of discharge, type of fracture, signs and symptoms such as diplopia, enophthalmos, and sensory disturbance related to the infraorbital nerve, complications before and after surgery, and follow-ups at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and after 1 year. ResultsSince January 2007, 34 patients were treated in our department with orbital fractures: 28 males (82. 4 %) and 6 females (17. 6 %). The mean age was 31 years (minimum 14, maximum 45). The main causes of trauma were road traffic accidents (20 patients, 58. 8 %), followed by work-related accidents (9 patients, 26. 5 %), aggressions (3 patients, 8. 8 %), and sports (2 patients, 6 %). Posttraumatic Diplopia was present in 20 patients (58. 8 %), and enophthalmos was in 9 (26. 5 %). The incidence of postoperative diplopia was present in 8 patients (23. 5 %), which decreased to 1 (2. 9 %) after one year. Paresthesia due to trauma was first noticed in 8 patients (20. 6 %) and completely disappeared after 12 months. Post surgical enophthalmos was noticed in 3 patients (7. 5 %). There was one case of migration of the mesh and one case of adherence in the lower lid. Both required surgery and resolved completely. Time from trauma to surgery was on average 5. 5 days (min 0, max 27, SD 5. 15), and the number of days before discharge was 3. 5 days (min 1, max 16, SD 2. 61). ConclusionsThis study describes the results of the first series of orbital floor reconstructions with a partially absorbable mesh (<b>Monofilament</b> polypropylene <b>fibre</b> and <b>monofilament</b> poliglecaprone- 25) to date. Although there are a wide variety of materials for treatment, we believe it is a suitable option with an acceptable rate of complications...|$|R
