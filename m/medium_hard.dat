5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
25|$|Prior to a song, each {{band member}} selects {{from one of}} four {{difficulty}} levels, Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert, which influence the number and rate that notes appear on the note track; they also can select the Pro mode for real guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums. As the band performs, they score points. Each player can build up a multiplier by hitting consecutive notes correctly, which increases how many points each note is worth, but the multiplier is set back to 1× if a note is missed. After successfully completing a song, the performance of each player and the band {{as a whole is}} rated on a 5-star scale. The best performance by a player for each song in the player's library is tracked separately based on instrument, Basic or Pro mode, and difficulty, then is used to provide and compare leaderboard statistics {{at the end of the}} song.|$|E
500|$|Before playing, a {{difficulty}} {{has to be}} selected: easy, <b>medium,</b> <b>hard</b> or expert. Expert is a match of the original notes; hard has some note-heavy drum rolls and other difficult or fast notes removed; medium takes away the orange notes (for guitar and bass) and anything else considered tricky. Easy is designed for new players, and gives an easy rhythm for those to settle into the game. However, there are too few notes for it to feel like they're playing the actual tune from the song. A [...] "No Fail" [...] mode has been carried over from Rock Band 2 and is accessible from the band members selection screen {{rather than from the}} game's main menu. This mode allows players to continue to play, even if their performance metre hits the bottom. In addition, No Fail mode is automatically enabled for any player who chooses the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty.|$|E

500|$|There are thirty songs {{within the}} solo [...] "Career" [...] mode. [...] The songs are grouped by {{difficulty}} into named tiers. [...] Furthermore, four overall difficulty levels [...] Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert [...] {{are present in}} the game, reflecting the number of frets that are employed, the number of notes to be played, and the speed at which the notes scroll on the screen. [...] Tiers are presented sequentially within each difficulty level; in lower difficulty modes, only 3 or 4 songs of each tier must be completed before the next tier is made available for that difficulty level, while in the higher difficulties, all five songs must be completed. [...] Once a tier is opened at any difficulty level, the songs in that tier are playable in quickplay or competitive modes. However, in the easiest difficulty, you only play five tiers, and cannot unlock bonus songs.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{is based}} on the same gameplay elements from [...] Players use a guitar controller to hold down fret keys and strum on the strum bar in time with the note patterns as they scroll down the screen in order to complete a song. The player's performance is tracked by a Rock Meter, and if it falls too low, the song ends prematurely. Star Power can be collected by completing marked note phrases correctly, and by using the whammy bar during sustained notes; Star Power is released by lifting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing the Select button in order to double the scoring multiplier and dramatically affect the Rock Meter. The player is rated after successfully completing a song from 3 to 5stars, and can examine statistics related to their performance, and in Career mode, awarded money to be used to unlock ten bonus songs in [...] "The Vault" [...] and additional guitars, outfits, and other videos about the band. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties: Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero II is a {{music video}} game {{developed}} by Harmonix and distributed by RedOctane, {{and is a}} sequel to Guitar Hero. [...] The game was released first to PlayStation 2 in , but later released for the Xbox 360 in [...] [...] Guitar Hero II challenges players to recreate the lead guitar portions of many rock music songs using a specially designed guitar-shaped controller, based on either a Gibson SG for the PlayStation 2 version, a Gibson Explorer for the Xbox 360 version, or else a standard console controller. As notes scroll down the screen towards the player, the player must hit both the fret buttons on the guitar controller and the strum bar {{at the same time}} in order to successfully hit the notes. Successfully hitting notes improves the player's performance in the game and also raises their score, while missing notes will reduce the player's performance, and a poor performance may end the song prematurely. Each song can be played at one of four difficulty levels: Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard</b> and Expert. These levels reflect the number of fret buttons used and the number and frequency of the notes to be performed.|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is a rhythm game, allowing up to four people play in a band on vocals, lead and bass/rhythm guitar, and drums, to use special instrument controllers to simulate the playing of rock music. In general, the goal for each player is to match scrolling note gems that correspond to that instrument's part in the given song to score points; the guitar and bass player must hold down the appropriate colored buttons on the controller and then use the strum bar as the notes pass over a marked zone; the drummer must strike the matching drum pads on the controller when the notes pass, and the vocalist must match the relative pitch of the song's lyrics as guided by phrase markers. Successfully striking notes earns points and boosts the player's performance meter; missing notes will cause this meter to drop. When playing by one's self, if the performance meter should empty, the song will end and require the player to restart it; when playing in a band, the remaining band members must play well enough for a limited time to [...] "revive" [...] a player that has fallen out due to an empty performance meter, or else the whole band will fail the song. Prior {{to the start of}} a song, each player can select one of five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert, with a sixth difficulty of Expert+ available to some songs on the drums which introduces a double bass pedal. Harder difficulties have characters with high note densities and more difficult playing techniques; each player can select their own difficulty to play.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{band member}} {{can choose the}} {{difficulty}} at which they play (spanning Easy, <b>Medium,</b> <b>Hard,</b> and Expert; a [...] "Super Easy" [...] difficulty is also present in Lego Rock Band for younger players). Furthermore, with Rock Band 3, players can select the Pro mode of their instrument {{if they have the}} appropriate controller for it; Pro mode challenges guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards to play their controllers closer to the real-life instrument, note-for-note. [...] If a player does not play well enough and falls {{to the bottom of the}} Band Meter, they will fail out of the song and their instrument will be muted from the audio mix. However, any active player can activate their Overdrive to bring failed players back into the song, [...] "saving" [...] the band member. However, a band member can only be saved twice; after the third failure, they cannot be brought back for that song. Failed players continuously drag the band's Band Meter down until they are saved. If the player is not saved before the Band Meter reaches the bottom, the band fails the song. Special portions of songs are labeled as [...] "Unison Phrases," [...] which reward the band with a score and Overdrive bonus if each player can play their parts perfectly during the phrase. Select songs end with a special [...] "Big Rock Ending," [...] which gives the players a chance to improvise and earn extra points. If each player successfully plays the final notes of the song following the freestyle portion of the [...] "Big Rock Ending," [...] the band earns all of the [...] "Big Rock Ending" [...] points. Otherwise, the bonus is lost.|$|E
