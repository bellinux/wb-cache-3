50|$|For longer journeys, such as {{from the}} {{municipal}} centre to outlying barangays, then <b>motor</b> <b>tricycles</b> are available.

5000|$|James' son Montague, born 1870, {{inherited}} {{the business in}} 1895, along with his father's engineering talents. Montague was a hobby racing cyclist, and at the Bath Road Club, he met [...] "ebullient Australian" [...] S. F. Edge (then a manager at Dunlop Rubber and colleague of H. J. Lawson in London, and amateur racer of <b>motor</b> <b>tricycles.)</b> Edge persuaded Napier to improve his Panhard ("Old Number 8", which had won the 1896 Paris-Marseille-Paris), converting from a tiller to a steering wheel and improving the oiling.|$|E
50|$|At the 1900 National Cycle Show, Dennis {{displayed}} only <b>motor</b> <b>tricycles</b> and quadricycles, {{with the}} tricycles {{claimed to be}} capable of a (then-remarkable) 30 mph, three times Britain's speed limit. The next year, a 3.5hp de Dion engine was offered in the tricycle, while there was a choice of two light cars, both with tube frames, three-speed gearbox, and shaft drive: an 8hp de Dion single and a 12hp Aster twin. About this time John Dennis built the Rodboro Buildings, the first purpose-built motor vehicle factory in Britain, to manufacture motorcars in the town centre.|$|E
5000|$|The De Dion-Bouton <b>motor</b> <b>tricycle</b> {{went into}} {{production}} in 1897 weighing just under 80 kg, with an output of 1.5 HP at 1,800 RPM from its 211 cc motor, although the engine {{had already been}} established in a prototype tricycle in 1895. [...] The tricycle with track width of 92 cm was chosen, because according to Dion and Bouton [...] "a bike appeared too fragile for this purpose." [...] The drive was achieved via a pair of gears from the motor directly to the rear axle. A differential balanced the different curve radii. The relatively high purchase price amounted to 1000 to 1500 gold marks. [...] The <b>motor</b> <b>tricycle</b> remained in continuous production for almost ten years. The last model (1904) increased the engine capacity and performance with a 955 cc displacement engine (bore 100 mm, stroke 120 mm) producing 8 HP at 1,800 RPM. On April 13, 1902, the French racer Georges Osmont set a speed record of 109.1 km/h in Nice with a De Dion-Bouton <b>motor</b> <b>tricycle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{the start}} of series {{production}} of the motor in 1895, and with {{the production of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>tricycle</b> in 1897, numerous manufacturers built engines or complete tricycles either under license or copied with slight changes: ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the war, carrier cycles were still in high demand {{but it was the}} continuation of the supply of larger tricycles, and the infant development of the motor car for the mass market, that received most of Pashley's attention. Having made motor rickshaws in the late 1940s, Pashley started the manufacture of Brockhouse Indian <b>Motor</b> <b>Tricycles</b> in 1950 - J. Brockhouse and Co. of Birmingham having acquired the Indian Motorcycle Company of Massachusetts and sub-contracted the manufacture to Pashley. These had a conventional 'two wheels at the back' tricycle layout, similar to the Pashley Pelican motorised rickshaw - with seats for up to four passengers - and the driver. Pashley were the first company to fit hydraulic brakes to what was, technically, a motorcycle. This innovation may have been influenced by Rath's younger son, John Pashley, who worked at Girling. The prototype Pelican Rickshaw has been returned to the company and awaits restoration.|$|E
5000|$|Ernest Chenard (1861-1922) was {{a railway}} {{engineer}} and maker of bicycles with {{a factory in}} the rue de Normandie at Asnières-sur-Seine, then just outside Paris on its north side. He joined with mining engineer Henri Walcker (1877-1912) in 1898 to make <b>motor</b> <b>tricycles.</b> Together they founded their automobile business on 19 January 1899, with Chenard in charge of design and Walcker sales and finance. The business was formally registered as Chenard, Walcker et Compagnie in 1900. In order to ensure short-term commercial viability they started out producing a quadricycle, but in 1900 their [...] "first true automobile", the [...] "Chenard et Walcker Type A" [...] was homologated with the authorities. This had a two-cylinder, [...] engine of their own design which drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox and an unusual transmission system. From the gearbox there were two drive shafts, one to each rear hub, with the hubs driven by gear teeth cut on the inside. The car was shown at the 1901 Paris Salon. The [...] "Chenard et Walcker Type B" [...] followed in 1901 and a fuller range was very soon on offer.|$|E
