5000|$|Eosinophils are terminally {{differentiated}} granulocytes {{found in}} most mammals. The principal role of these cells, in a healthy host, is the elimination of antibody bound parasites through the release of cytotoxic granule proteins. [...] Given that eosinophils are the primary IL-5Rα-expressing cells, {{it is not surprising}} that this cell type responds to IL-5. In fact, IL-5 was originally discovered as an eosinophil colony-stimulating factor, is a major regulator of eosinophil accumulation in tissues, and can modulate eosinophil behavior at every stage from maturation to survival. <b>Mepolizumab</b> is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 which can reduce excessive eosinophilia.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{primarily}} {{consists of}} reducing eosinophil levels and preventing further damage to organs. Corticosteroids, such as Prednisone, {{are good for}} reducing eosinophil levels and antineoplastics are useful for slowing eosinophil production. Surgical therapy is rarely utilised, however splenectomy can reduce the pain due to spleen enlargement. If damage to the heart (in particular the valves), then prosthetic valves can replace the current organic ones. Follow-up care is vital {{for the survival of}} the patient, as such the patient should be checked for any signs of deterioration regularly. After promising results in drug trials (95% efficiency in reducing blood eosinophil count to acceptable levels) it is hoped that in the future hypereosinophilic syndrome, and diseases related to eosinophils such as asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, may be treated with the monoclonal antibody <b>Mepolizumab</b> currently being developed to treat the disease. If this becomes successful, it may be possible for corticosteroids to be eradicated and thus reduce the amount of side effects encountered.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia {{usually takes}} a benign and {{indolent}} course.

However, {{signs and symptoms of}} the disease recur in virtually all cases if corticosteroid dosages are tapered {{in order to reduce the}} many adverse side effects of corticosteroids. Alternate treatments used to treat corticosteroid resistant disease or for use as corticosteroid-sparing substitutes include interferon-α or its analog, Peginterferon alfa-2a, <b>Mepolizumab</b> (an antibody directed against IL-5), Ciclosporin (an Immunosuppressive drug), imatinib (an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases; numerous tyrosine kinase cell signaling proteins are responsible for the growth and proliferation of eosinophils {see clonal eosinophilia}), methotrexate and Hydroxycarbamide (both are chemotherapy and immunosuppressant drugs), and Alemtuzumab (a antibody that binds to the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes thereby marking them for destruction by the body). The few patients who have been treated with these alternate drugs have exhibited good responses in the majority of instances. Reslizumab, a newly developed antibody directed against interleukin 5 that has been successfully used to treat 4 patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome, may also be of use for lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia. Patients suffering minimal or no disease complications have gone untreated.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{patients}} with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids {{with or without}} oral glucocorticoids. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, we assigned 576 {{patients with}} recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids {{to one of three}} study groups. Patients were assigned to receive <b>mepolizumab,</b> a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin- 5, which was administered as either a 75 -mg intravenous dose or a 100 -mg subcutaneous dose, or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5 -item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ- 5). Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> and by 53 % (95 % CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab,</b> as compared with those receiving placebo (P< 0. 001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32 % in the group receiving intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> and by 61 % in the group receiving subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab.</b> At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV 1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> than in those receiving placebo (P = 0. 02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> than in those receiving placebo (P = 0. 03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6. 4 points and 7. 0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> groups, respectively, than in the placebo group (minimal clinically important change, 4 points), and the improvement in the ACQ- 5 score was 0. 42 points and 0. 44 points greater in the two <b>mepolizumab</b> groups, respectively, than in the placebo group (minimal clinically important change, 0. 5 points) (P < 0. 001 for all comparisons). The safety profile of <b>mepolizumab</b> was similar to that of placebo.

40|$|Background: The MENSA trial {{assessed}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>mepolizumab</b> in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. This report describes the efficacy and safety of <b>mepolizumab</b> in Japanese patients from MENSA. Methods: A post hoc analysis of the Japanese subgroup from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, Phase III MENSA trial (NCT 01691521). Patients ≥ 12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma received <b>mepolizumab</b> 75  mg intravenously (IV), 100  mg subcutaneously (SC), or placebo, every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of exacerbations. Secondary and other endpoints included annualized rate of exacerbations requiring emergency department (ED) visit/hospitalization, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score and eosinophil counts. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Results: In the Japanese subgroup (N =  50), the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was reduced by 90 % (rate ratio [RR]: 0. 10; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 02 – 0. 57; P =  0. 010) with <b>mepolizumab</b> IV and 62 % (RR: 0. 38; 95 % CI: 0. 12 – 1. 18; P =  0. 094) with <b>mepolizumab</b> SC, versus placebo. No exacerbations requiring ED visit/hospitalization were reported with <b>mepolizumab</b> IV; exacerbations were reduced by 73 % (RR: 0. 27; 95 % CI: 0. 06 – 1. 29; P =  0. 102) with <b>mepolizumab</b> SC versus placebo. Compared with placebo, <b>mepolizumab</b> IV and SC numerically increased morning PEF from baseline by 40  L/min and 13  L/min, improved quality of life by greater than the minimal clinically important difference (SGRQ: 9. 5 [P =  0. 083] and 7. 9 [P =  0. 171] points) and reduced eosinophil counts. AE incidence was similar between treatments. Results were broadly consistent with the overall population.

40|$|AbstractPurposePatients {{with severe}} eosinophilic asthma often {{experience}} recurrent asthma exacerbations despite intensive inhaled corticosteroid therapy. In 2 previous double-blind studies (MENSA [NCT 01691521] and SIRIUS [NCT 01691508]), treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> {{was associated with}} significantly reduced annualized exacerbation rates and oral corticosteroid (OCS) requirements compared with placebo. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. MethodsCOSMOS was a 52 -week, open-label extension study in patients who received <b>mepolizumab</b> or placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS. Patients received subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> regardless of prior treatment allocation and continued to receive appropriate standard-of-care asthma therapy throughout. The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety of mepolizumab; end points included adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). Efficacy assessments included the annualized exacerbation rate and durability of response (defined as the exacerbation rate and OCS dose reduction when combined with MENSA and SIRIUS data, respectively). FindingsIn total, 558 (86 %; previous mepolizumab: 358; previous placebo: 200) and 94 (14 %; previous mepolizumab: 58, previous placebo: 36) patients experienced on-treatment AEs and SAEs, respectively. No fatal AEs were reported. Totals of 13 (2 %) and 29 (4 %) patients experienced systemic and local site reactions, respectively. There were no reports of mepolizumab-related anaphylaxis. <b>Mepolizumab</b> treatment was shown to exert a durable response, with patients who previously received <b>mepolizumab</b> in MENSA or SIRIUS maintaining reductions in exacerbation rate and OCS dosing throughout COSMOS. Patients who previously received placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS demonstrated improvements in these end points following treatment with <b>mepolizumab</b> in COSMOS. ImplicationsThese data demonstrate a favorable safety profile of <b>mepolizumab</b> and indicate a durable and stable effect over time, supporting long-term treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

40|$|<b>Mepolizumab</b> is an anti-interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{that has been}} recently approved as an add-on biological treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma, by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Moreover, <b>mepolizumab</b> is also currently included within the step 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines, as an add-on therapy for severe uncontrolled asthma. The relevant therapeutic benefits detectable in patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma receiving <b>mepolizumab</b> depend on the pivotal pathogenic role played by IL- 5 in these subjects. Indeed, IL- 5 is the key cytokine responsible for maturation, activation, proliferation, and survival of eosinophils. Therefore, IL- 5 represents a strategic molecular target for anti-eosinophilic treatments. By selectively inhibiting the biological actions of IL- 5, <b>mepolizumab</b> provides a valuable therapeutic option for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, refractory to standard treatments including inhaled and even systemic corticosteroids.

40|$|Background: Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs) are chronic {{disorders}} {{that require}} long-term therapy to suppress eosinophilia and clinical manifestations. Corticosteroids are usually effective, yet many patients become corticosteroid refractory or develop corticosteroid toxicity. <b>Mepolizumab,</b> a humanized monoclonal anti-IL- 5 antibody, showed corticosteroid-sparing effects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of FIP 1 L 1 /PDGFRA-negative, corticosteroid-responsive subjects with HESs. Objective: We evaluated long-term {{safety and efficacy}} of <b>mepolizumab</b> (750 mg) in HES. Methods: MHE 100901 is an open-label extension study. The primary end point was the frequency of adverse events (AEs). Optimal dosing frequency, corticosteroid-sparing effect of <b>mepolizumab,</b> and development of antimepolizumab antibodies were also explored. Results: Seventy-eight subjects received 1 to 66 <b>mepolizumab</b> infusions each (including <b>mepolizumab</b> infusions received in the placebo-controlled trial). Mean exposure was 251 weeks (range, 4 - 302 weeks). The most common dosing interval was 9 to 12 weeks. The incidence of AEs was 932 events per 100 subject-years in the first year, declining to 461 events per 100 subject-years after 48 months. Serious AEs, including 1 death, were reported by the investigator as possibly due to <b>mepolizumab</b> in 3 subjects. The median daily prednisone dose decreased from 20. 0 to 0 mg in the first 24 weeks. The median average daily dose for all subjects {{over the course of}} the study was 1. 8 mg. Sixty-two percent of subjects were prednisone free without other HES medications for ≥ 12 consecutive weeks. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. Twenty-four subjects withdrew before study completion for death (n = 4), lack of efficacy (n = 6), or other reasons. Conclusion: <b>Mepolizumab</b> was well tolerated and effective as a long-term corticosteroid-sparing agent in PDGFRA-negative HES. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Mepolizumab</b> {{is a human}} {{monoclonal}} antibody against interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), the main cytokine involved in the activation of eosinophils, which in turn causes airway inflammation. Recent studies have suggested these agents may {{have a role in}} reducing exacerbations and improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There are no recommendations for the use of <b>mepolizumab</b> in adults or children in the recent update of the BTS/SIGN guidelines (BTS/SIGN 2014). Objectives To compare the effects of <b>mepolizumab</b> with placebo on exacerbations and HRQoL in adults and children with chronic asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (CAGR) of trials, clinical trial registries, manufacturers' websites and the reference lists of included studies. Searches were conducted in November 2013 and updated in November 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing <b>mepolizumab</b> versus placebo in adults and children with asthma. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random-effects model. We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Eight studies on 1707 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies included children (over 12 years of age), but they did not report separate findings for the adolescents. Seven studies involved intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> alone; one included a subcutaneous arm. There was heterogeneity in the severity and clinical pattern of asthma among the participants in the eight studies, varying from mild to moderate atopic asthma, to persistent asthma and eosinophilic asthma with recurrent exacerbations. Selection bias was a concern in several of the studies included in this review. Four trials compared intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> to placebo in relation to HRQoL. Two studies measured scores from the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), which showed a non-significant difference between <b>mepolizumab</b> and placebo (mean difference (MD) 0. 21, 95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 01 to 0. 44; participants = 682), in the direction favouring <b>mepolizumab.</b> The third study used the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and found a significant difference between <b>mepolizumab</b> and placebo (MD 6. 40, 95 % CI 3. 15 to 9. 65; participants = 576), which indicated a clinically important benefit favouring <b>mepolizumab.</b> A fourth study noted that {{there was no significant difference}} but did not provide any data. The two studies in people with eosinophilic asthma showed a reduction in clinically significant exacerbation rates (Risk Ratio 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 0. 64; participants = 690). However, an analysis of four studies that were not confined to people with eosinophilic asthma indicated considerable heterogeneity and no significant difference in people with one or more exacerbations between <b>mepolizumab</b> and placebo using a random-effects model (Risk Ratio 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 1. 31; participants = 468; I 2 = 59 %). The analysis of serious adverse events indicated a significant difference favouring <b>mepolizumab</b> (Risk ratio 0. 49, 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 80; participants = 1441; studies = 5; I 2 = 0 %). It was not possible to combine the results for adverse events, and we deemed the quality of this evidence to be low. A single study compared subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> to placebo in 385 adults with severe eosinophilic asthma and found an improvement in HRQoL scores and a reduction in asthma exacerbations, including exacerbations requiring admission to hospital. Authors' conclusions It is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this review with respect to the role of <b>mepolizumab</b> in patients with asthma. Our confidence in the results of this review are limited by the fact that the intravenous route is not currently licensed for <b>mepolizumab,</b> and the evidence for the currently licenced subcutaneous route is limited to a single study in participants with severe eosinophilic asthma. The currently available studies provide evidence that <b>mepolizumab</b> can lead to an improvement in health-related quality of life scores and reduce asthma exacerbations in people with severe eosinophilic asthma. Further research is needed to clarify which subgroups of patients with asthma could potentially benefit from this treatment. Dosage, ideal dosing regimens and duration of treatment need to be clarified, as the studies included in this review differed in their protocols. There are no studies reporting results from children, so we cannot comment on treatment for this age group. At the present time, larger studies using licenced treatment regimens are required to establish the role of <b>mepolizumab</b> in the treatment of severe asthma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} with severe asthma have recurrent asthma exacerbations associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. Early {{studies suggest that}} inhibition of eosinophilic airway inflammation with mepolizumab-a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5 -is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations. We aimed to establish efficacy, safety, and patient characteristics associated with the response to <b>mepolizumab.</b> Methods: We undertook a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 81 centres in 13 countries between Nov 9, 2009, and Dec 5, 2011. Eligible patients were aged 12 - 74 years, {{had a history of}} recurrent severe asthma exacerbations, and had signs of eosinophilic inflammation. They were randomly assigned (in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio) to receive one of three doses of intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> (75 mg, 250 mg, or 750 mg) or matched placebo (100 mL 0 · 9 % NaCl) with a central telephone-based system and computer-generated randomly permuted block schedule stratified by whether treatment with oral corticosteroids was required. Patients received 13 infusions at 4 -week intervals. The primary outcome was the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations, which were defined as validated episodes of acute asthma requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, admission, or a visit to an emergency department. Patients, clinicians, and data analysts were masked to treatment assignment. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01000506. Findings: 621 patients were randomised: 159 were assigned to placebo, 154 to 75 mg <b>mepolizumab,</b> 152 to 250 mg <b>mepolizumab,</b> and 156 to 750 mg <b>mepolizumab.</b> 776 exacerbations were deemed to be clinically significant. The rate of clinically significant exacerbations was 2 · 40 per patient per year in the placebo group, 1 · 24 in the 75 mg <b>mepolizumab</b> group (48 % reduction, 95 % CI 31 - 61 %; p< 0 · 0001), 1 · 46 in the 250 mg <b>mepolizumab</b> group (39 % reduction, 19 - 54 %; p= 0 · 0005), and 1 · 15 in the 750 mg <b>mepolizumab</b> group (52 % reduction, 36 - 64 %; p< 0 · 0001).

40|$|Background: <b>Mepolizumab,</b> a {{monoclonal}} anti-IL- 5 antibody, is {{an effective}} corticosteroid-sparing agent for patients with Fip 1 -like 1 /platelet-derived growth factor receptor α fusion (F/P) -negative hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Lymphocytic variant hypereosinophilic syndrome (L-HES) is characterized by marked overproduction of IL- 5 by dysregulated T cells. Objective: To determine whether patients with L-HES respond to <b>mepolizumab</b> in terms of corticosteroid tapering and eosinophil depletion {{to the same extent}} as corticosteroid-responsive F/P-negative patients with HES and a normal T-cell profile. Methods: Patients enrolled in the <b>mepolizumab</b> trial were evaluated for L-HES on the basis of T-cell phenotyping and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement patterns, and their serum thymus-and-activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) levels were measured. Response to treatment was compared in patient subgroups based on results of these analyses. Results: Lymphocytic variant HES was diagnosed in 13 of 63 patients with HES with complete T-cell assessments. The ability to taper corticosteroids on <b>mepolizumab</b> was similar in patients with L-HES and those with a normal T-cell profile, although a lower proportion of patients with L-HES maintained eosinophil levels below 600 /μL. Increased serum TARC levels (> 1000 pg/mL) had no significant impact on the ability to reduce corticosteroid doses, but a lower proportion of patients with elevated TARC achieved eosinophil control on <b>mepolizumab.</b> Conclusion: <b>Mepolizumab</b> {{is an effective}} corticosteroid-sparing agent for patients with L-HES. In some cases however, eosinophil levels remain above 600 /μL, suggesting incomplete neutralization of overproduced IL- 5 or involvement of other eosinophilopoietic factors. © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

40|$|BACKGROUND Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) with an eosinophilic phenotype {{may benefit from}} treatment with <b>mepolizumab,</b> a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin- 5. METHODS We performed two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing <b>mepolizumab</b> (100 mg in METREX, 100 or 300 mg in METREO) with placebo, given as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in patients with COPD who had a history of moderate or severe exacerbations while taking inhaled glucocorticoid-based triple maintenance therapy. In METREX, unselected patients in the modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype were stratified according to blood eosinophil count (>= 150 per cubic millimeter at screening or >= 300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year). In METREO, all patients had a blood eosinophil count of at least 150 per cubic millimeter at screening or at least 300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year. The primary end point was the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS In METREX, the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype (462 patients) was 1. 40 per year in the <b>mepolizumab</b> group versus 1. 71 per year in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 68 to 0. 98; adjusted P = 0. 04); no significant between-group differences were found in the overall modified intention-to-treat population (836 patients) (rate ratio, 0. 98; 95 % CI, 0. 85 to 1. 12; adjusted P> 0. 99). In METREO, the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was 1. 19 per year in the 100 -mg <b>mepolizumab</b> group, 1. 27 per year in the 300 -mg <b>mepolizumab</b> group, and 1. 49 per year in the placebo group. The rate ratios for exacerbations in the 100 -mg and 300 -mg <b>mepolizumab</b> groups versus the placebo group were 0. 80 (95 % CI, 0. 65 to 0. 98; adjusted P = 0. 07) and 0. 86 (95 % CI, 0. 70 to 1. 05; adjusted P = 0. 14), respectively. A greater effect of <b>mepolizumab,</b> as compared with placebo, on the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was found among patients with higher blood eosinophil counts at screening. The safety profile of <b>mepolizumab</b> was similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS <b>Mepolizumab</b> at a dose of 100 mg was associated with a lower annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations than placebo among patients with COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype.

40|$|Patients with eosinophilic nasal {{polyposis}} frequently require surgery, and recurrence rates are high. We sought {{to assess the}} efficacy and safety of <b>mepolizumab</b> versus placebo for severe bilateral {{nasal polyposis}}. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited patients aged 18 to 70 years with recurrent nasal polyposis requiring surgery. Patients received 750 mg of intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> or placebo every 4 weeks {{for a total of}} 6 doses in addition to daily topical corticosteroid treatment. The primary end point was the number of patients no longer requiring surgery at Week 25 based on a composite end point of endoscopic nasal polyp score and nasal polyposis severity visual analog scale (VAS) score.

40|$|Background Patients with eosinophilic nasal {{polyposis}} frequently require surgery, and recurrence rates are high. Objective We sought {{to assess the}} efficacy and safety of <b>mepolizumab</b> versus placebo for severe bilateral {{nasal polyposis}}. Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited patients aged 18 to 70 years with recurrent nasal polyposis requiring surgery. Patients received 750 mg of intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> or placebo every 4 weeks {{for a total of}} 6 doses in addition to daily topical corticosteroid treatment. The primary end point was the number of patients no longer requiring surgery at Week 25 based on a composite end point of endoscopic nasal polyp score and nasal polyposis severity visual analog scale (VAS) score. Secondary end points included change in nasal polyposis severity VAS score, endoscopic nasal polyp score, improvement in individual VAS symptoms (rhinorrhea, mucus in throat, nasal blockage, and sense of smell), patient-reported outcomes, and safety.

40|$|As {{part of its}} single {{technology}} appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{invited the}} company (GlaxoSmithKline) that manufactures <b>mepolizumab</b> (Nucala(®)) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of <b>mepolizumab</b> {{for the treatment of}} severe eosinophilic asthma. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG). The ERG produced a review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of <b>mepolizumab</b> as add-on to standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC and omalizumab, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the company's submission was based predominantly on three randomised controlled trials (DREAM, MENSA and SIRIUS) comparing add-on <b>mepolizumab</b> with placebo plus SoC. The relevant population was defined in terms of degree of asthma severity (four or more exacerbations in the previous year and/or dependency on maintenance oral corticosteroids [mOCS]) and degree of eosinophilia (a blood eosinophil count of ≥  300 cells/µl in the previous year) based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials. Other subpopulations were considered throughout the appraisal, defined by different eosinophil measurements, number of exacerbations and dependency (or lack thereof) on mOCS. Statistically significant reductions in clinically significant exacerbations were observed in patients receiving <b>mepolizumab</b> compared with SoC meta-analysed across MENSA and DREAM in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (rate ratio [RR] 0. 51; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 42 - 0. 62) {{as well as in the}} relevant population (RR 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 36 - 0. 62). In terms of quality of life, differences on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire in MENSA for add-on subcutaneous <b>mepolizumab</b> 100  mg vs. placebo were 7 and 7. 5 units in the modified ITT and relevant populations, respectively. A number of issues in the clinical evidence base warrant caution in its interpretation. The ERG noted that the definition of SoC used in the trials differed from that in clinical practice, where patients with severe uncontrolled asthma start treatment with a mOCS. The company's economic post-consultation analysis incorporating a confidential patient access scheme (PAS) estimated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for add-on <b>mepolizumab</b> compared with SoC was £ 27, 418 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the relevant population if patients stopped <b>mepolizumab</b> after 1  year unless (1) the number of exacerbations decreased at least 50 % or (2) a reduction in corticosteroids dose was achieved whilst maintaining asthma control. The ERG applied an age adjustment to all utilities and corrected the post-continuation assessment utilities, which resulted in an ICER for add-on <b>mepolizumab</b> compared with SoC of £ 29, 163 per QALY gained. The ERG noted that this ICER was not robust for patients who continued treatment due to a corticosteroid dose reduction where exacerbations had decreased by less than 50 %, because corticosteroid dose reduction was not allowed in the main trial in which the evidence was gathered (MENSA). The NICE appraisal committee (AC) concluded that add-on <b>mepolizumab</b> could be recommended as an option for treating severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults for the relevant population when the stopping rule suggested by the company was applied. The AC also concluded that the comparison between <b>mepolizumab</b> and omalizumab was not clinically relevant or methodologically robust...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{patients}} with severe asthma require regular treatment with oral glucocorticoids despite {{the use of}} high-dose inhaled therapy. However, the regular use of systemic glucocorticoids can result in serious and often irreversible adverse effects. <b>Mepolizumab,</b> a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin- 5, {{has been shown to}} reduce asthma exacerbations in {{patients with}} severe eosinophilic asthma. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 135 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, we compared the glucocorticoid-sparing effect of <b>mepolizumab</b> (at a dose of 100 mg) with that of placebo administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in the glucocorticoid dose (90 to 100 % reduction, 75 to less than 90 % reduction, 50 to less than 75 % reduction, more than 0 to less than 50 % reduction, or no decrease in oral glucocorticoid dose, a lack of asthma control during weeks 20 to 24, or withdrawal from treatment). Other outcomes included the rate of asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and safety. RESULTS: The likelihood of a reduction in the glucocorticoid-dose stratum was 2. 39 times greater in the <b>mepolizumab</b> group than in the placebo group (95 % confidence interval, 1. 25 to 4. 56; P= 0. 008). The median percentage reduction from baseline in the glucocorticoid dose was 50 % in the <b>mepolizumab</b> group, as compared with no reduction in the placebo group (P= 0. 007). Despite receiving a reduced glucocorticoid dose, patients in the <b>mepolizumab</b> group, as compared with those in the placebo group, had a relative reduction of 32 % in the annualized rate of exacerbations (1. 44 vs. 2. 12, P= 0. 04) and a reduction of 0. 52 points with respect to asthma symptoms (P= 0. 004), as measured on the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 (in which the minimal clinically important difference is 0. 5 points). The safety profile of <b>mepolizumab</b> was similar to that of placebo.

Moreover, <b>mepolizumab</b> is also currently included within the step 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines, as an add-on therapy for severe uncontrolled asthma. The relevant therapeutic benefits detectable in patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma receiving <b>mepolizumab</b> depend on the pivotal pathogenic role played by IL- 5 in these subjects. Indeed, IL- 5 is the key cytokine responsible for maturation, activation, proliferation, and survival of eosinophils. Therefore, IL- 5 represents a strategic molecular target for anti-eosinophilic treatments. By selectively inhibiting the biological actions of IL- 5, <b>mepolizumab</b> provides a valuable therapeutic option for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, refractory to standard treatments including inhaled and even systemic corticosteroids. In particular, the very important advantages linked {{to the use of}} <b>mepolizumab</b> in these difficult-to-treat asthmatic individuals have been well documented by several different trials performed worldwide.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The hypereosinophilic {{syndrome}} {{is a group}} of diseases characterized by persistent blood eosinophilia, defined as more than 1500 cells per microliter with end-organ involvement and no recognized secondary cause. Although most patients have a response to corticosteroids, side effects are common and can lead to considerable morbidity. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti-interleukin- 5 monoclonal antibody, <b>mepolizumab,</b> in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients were negative for the FIP 1 L 1 -PDGFRA fusion gene and required prednisone monotherapy, 20 to 60 mg per day, to maintain a stable clinical status and a blood eosinophil count of less than 1000 per microliter. Patients received either intravenous <b>mepolizumab</b> or placebo while the prednisone dose was tapered. The primary end point was the reduction of the prednisone dose to 10 mg or less per day for 8 or more consecutive weeks. RESULTS: The primary end point was reached in 84 % of patients in the <b>mepolizumab</b> group, as compared with 43 % of patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2. 90; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 59 to 5. 26; P< 0. 001) with no increase in clinical activity of the hypereosinophilic syndrome. A blood eosinophil count of less than 600 per microliter for 8 or more consecutive weeks was achieved in 95 % of patients receiving <b>mepolizumab,</b> as compared with 45 % of patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 3. 53; 95 % CI, 1. 94 to 6. 45; P< 0. 001). Serious adverse events occurred in seven patients receiving <b>mepolizumab</b> (14 events, including one death; mean [+/-SD] duration of exposure, 6. 7 +/- 1. 9 months) and in five patients receiving placebo (7 events; mean duration of exposure, 4. 3 +/- 2. 6 months).

40|$|Background Findings from {{previous}} studies showed that <b>mepolizumab</b> significantly reduces the rate of exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. To assess the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil counts and efficacy of <b>mepolizumab</b> we did a secondary analysis of data from two studies, stratifying patients by different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds. Methods We did a post-hoc analysis of data, which was completed on Sept 25, 2015, from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least 32 weeks duration (NCT 01000506 [DREAM] and NCT 01691521 [MENSA]) done between 2009 and 2014. In these studies, <b>mepolizumab</b> (DREAM: 75 mg, 250 mg, or 750 mg intravenously; MENSA: 75 mg intravenously or 100 mg subcutaneously) versus placebo was given at 4 -week intervals in addition to standard care (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus ≥ 1 additional controller with or without daily oral corticosteroids) to patients aged 12 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, a history {{of at least two}} exacerbations in the previous year that required systemic corticosteroid treatment, and evidence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. The primary endpoint in both studies was the annual rate of clinically significant exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma that required the use of systemic corticosteroids, or admission to hospital, or an emergency-room visit, or a combination of these occurrences). In our analysis, the primary outcome was the annualised rate of exacerbations in patients stratified by baseline eosinophil counts (≥ 150 cells per μL, ≥ 300 cells per μL, ≥ 400 cells per μL, and ≥ 500 cells per μL) and baseline blood eosinophil ranges (Findings Of 1192 patients, 846 received <b>mepolizumab</b> and 346 received placebo. The overall rate of mean exacerbations per person per year was reduced from 1 · 91 with placebo to 1 · 01 with <b>mepolizumab</b> (47 % reduction; rate ratio [RR] 0 · 53, 95 % CI 0 · 44 – 0 · 62; p Interpretation Our analysis has shown a close relationship between baseline blood eosinophil count and clinical efficacy of <b>mepolizumab</b> in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and a history of exacerbations.

40|$|Background: Periostin is a {{recently}} discovered biomarker for eosinophilic inflammation. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a T-helper 2 -skewed chronic inflammatory airway disease. Medical treatments aim to relieve symptoms and maintain clinical control by {{interfering with the}} inflammatory cascade. The effect on nasal and serum periostin levels is however yet unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omalizumab, <b>mepolizumab,</b> methylprednisolone and doxycycline on nasal and systemic periostin expression. Methods: This study is based on 3 previously published trials. Nasal and systemic periostin were assessed in CRSwNP patients, randomly assigned to receive doxycycline (n= 14), methylprednisolone (n= 14), <b>mepolizumab</b> (n= 20) or omalizumab (n= 15). There was a control group for each treatment scheme.
