40|$|Indonesia as an {{archipelagic}} {{country has}} territorial waters {{wider than the}} land, so the Indonesian seas provide a very large alternative energy, such as energy produced from ocean currents. This energy can produce a very large kinetic energy and environmentally friendly. During this ocean current energy generation power that has developed and patented a type of Darrieus Water Turbine propulsion and turbine vertical Axiz kobolt. In this study, using a turbine with NACA 0018 foil type, by modifying the NACA 0018 foil with changing chord length and thickness of the blade to get a big lift and drag are smaller than the foil using a standard numerical method Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Single foil modified by reducing {{the thickness of the}} blade to be at 50 %, 80 %, 95 % decline in the value of CL and the ratio CL / CD. While the modifications {{with the addition of a}} chord of 5 %, 10 %, 15 % an increase in the value of CL and the ratio CL / CD. Based on these results the best modifications for a single foil is to increase the length of 15 % chord. As for the best modification of the group for the thickness is the thickness of 95 % occurred at 9. 9 seconds with a <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>Nm</b> ² 1, 72. 10 and chord length for modification is the addition of 5 % occurred in 4. 3 seconds with a maximum torque of 1, 84. 10 Nm ² </p...|$|E

40|$|This project report {{deals with}} {{performance}} of electric vehicle Proton Green Mobility Challenge (PGMC) 2012 which won {{first place in}} best acceleration and make UMP proud of it. The performance of this proton saga converted to electric needs to be evaluated. The performance test is done on chassis dynamometer {{which is in the}} lab at University Malaysia Pahang (UMP). The objective of this project is to determine the performance of electric car with respect to power, torque and voltage drop of the battery while using it. The method that was conducted during the performance test is two tests which are performance curve test and acceleration test. Both tests are done into two modes which is economy and power mode. From result, the economy mode is a power saving mode which produce low power, low torque and low voltage consumption meanwhile the power mode is for high performance mode. In power mode, the car produces high torque, power and consumes a lot of voltage. The performance is done for first, second and third gear. As a conclusion the performance of first gear economy mode has reach maximum power is 21. 82 kW and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> of 103 <b>Nm.</b> The performance for the second gear economy mode has reached maximum power of 22. 89 kW and the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is 56 <b>Nm.</b> The performance of third gear economy mode has reached maximum power of 24. 71 kW and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is 30 <b>Nm.</b> The performance of first gear power mode has reach maximum power is 37. 8 kW and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> of 198 <b>Nm.</b> The performance for the second gear economy mode has reached maximum power of 40. 1 kW and the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is 130 <b>Nm.</b> The performance of third gear economy mode has reached maximum power of 40. 5 kW and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is 51 <b>Nm.</b> The main criterion that changes the mode of the car is the need for the torque and power.
