5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
25|$|Registers will {{typically}} {{feature a}} numerical pad, QWERTY or custom keyboard, touch screen interface, {{or a combination}} of these input methods for the cashier to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale. For older registers as well as at restaurants and other establishments that do not sell barcoded items, the <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> may be the only method of interacting with the register. While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard for <b>manual</b> <b>input.</b> The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E

500|$|Marochetti's {{creation}} of the clay model of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor Mottez, King Louis Philippe's personal physician Henri Gueneau de Mussy and the singers Mario and Garcia, all of whom contributed <b>manual</b> <b>input.</b> A clay model of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after {{the opening of the}} exhibition on 1 May 1851, the horse's tail fell off. It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim. The art critic John Ruskin said of the model, [...] "it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries". It came to be {{regarded as one of the}} more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold to see it and the statue by Simonis, which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels. The Art Journal was later to describe it as [...] "unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture." ...|$|E
500|$|Like all Progress spacecraft, M1-5 carried two docking systems, Kurs and TORU. The {{automated}} Kurs {{system was}} the primary docking system, with TORU, which required <b>manual</b> <b>input,</b> as the backup. Because Mir was unmanned {{at the time of}} its docking, and a cosmonaut aboard the station would have been required to perform a TORU docking, or to troubleshoot any other problems during the docking, the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft was made ready for a flight to Mir should human intervention be required. The Soyuz may also have been launched if the flight control system aboard Mir failed. Cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov were originally scheduled to have been on standby for this mission, with Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin, the crew who eventually flew TM-32 to the International Space Station, as the backup crew. [...] However, in December 2000, they were replaced by Gennady Padalka and Nikolai Budarin, a crew which became known as Expedition Zero. These cosmonauts were chosen because of their training for a similar emergency mission to the International Space Station the previous year, which would have been launched if the Zvezda module had failed to dock. If a manned flight had been launched, controllers would have waited until after it had landed to begin the deorbit of Mir.|$|E

40|$|After viewing {{data from}} the first flight, it was {{observed}} that there was some discrepancy in the dutch-roll mode between the predicted model and the actual flight data.
