Both <b>men</b> <b>said</b> they were encouraging Dunderdale to run and that they would endorse her campaign if she entered the race. On December 23, 2010, Dunderdale garnered support from two other cabinet ministers when Finance Minister Tom Marshall and Municipal Affairs Minister Kevin O'Brien opted out of running for the leadership and threw their support behind her entering the race.|$|E

25|$|Pain during {{receptive}} {{anal sex}} among gay men (or {{men who have}} sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia. In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual <b>men</b> <b>said</b> they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated that they always experienced some degree of pain during anal sex, and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during anal sex include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being closeted. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors to the experience of pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion that pain is always inevitable during anal sex.|$|E

500|$|Gleeson made {{frequent}} {{visits to}} the front lines and often conducted burial services there with wooden grave marker crosses that he made himself or entering no man's land to comfort dying soldiers. His <b>men</b> <b>said</b> that they were always sure of a cup of tea from him when he visited the trenches late at night and he was certain to check that they were not short of ammunition. Gleeson sent requests to Ireland for hymn books for the men in the field and also bought mouth organs for their entertainment. One of Gleeson's <b>men</b> <b>said</b> [...] "He's a warrior and no mistake. There's no man at the Front more brave or cooler. Why, it is in the hottest place up in the firing line he do be to give comfort to the boys that are dying."

500|$|Icke {{has emerged}} as a {{professional}} conspiracy theorist within a global counter-cultural movement that combines New World Order conspiracism, the truther movement and anti-globalization, with an extraterrestrial conspiracist subculture (Roswell, alien abduction, crop circles, men in black, The X-Files). Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An Official Information Act request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of John Key, the prime minister, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was asked the same during a Q in 2016. (Both <b>men</b> <b>said</b> they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.)

Magnus attempted to assert control over his disordered army, ordering part of his force to seize secure ground and use archery fire to slow the Irish. In the melee Magnus was pierced by a spear through both thighs above the knees but he fought on, attempting to get his men back to the level campsite. An axe-wielding Irishman charged him, striking a lethal blow to his neck.

Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly stipend of $250 ($ in [...] ) {{until the end of the}} war. It was a large amount of money at the time. [...] "All I asked was, where do I sign?" [...] Graham said later. [...] "Some of the other navy <b>men</b> <b>said</b> I was rooting for the war to last forever." [...] Graham was also drafted by the National Football League's Detroit Lions, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.|$|E
500|$|The {{next few}} days of {{testimony}} were filled with accounts from African-American enlisted men from Divisions Two, Four and Eight, who were not standing accused of mutiny. Some of these men had already been convicted of disobeying orders in summary courts-martial. The testimony of the men agreed on several points: {{that there had been}} talk among them of a mass work-stoppage leading up to August 9, that some men (none of the accused 50) had passed around and signed a petition to avoid loading ammunition, and that Joe Small had spoken at the meeting on the prison barge and had urged the men to obey their officers and to conduct themselves in an orderly fashion. Some <b>men</b> <b>said</b> Small's speech included words to the effect of having the officers [...] "by the tail" [...] or [...] "by the ass". Coakley was challenged by Veltmann when he attempted to bring the men's signed statements in as evidence but the court allowed the statements to be used to refresh the men's memories of their answers to interrogation.|$|E

500|$|Starting on September 23 and {{continuing}} {{for over three}} weeks, each of the accused men {{was brought to the}} witness stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men's responses was that all of them were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by [...] "ringleaders" [...] persuading them not to workeach had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some <b>men</b> <b>said</b> that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers [...] "by the balls". On the witness stand, Small himself denied saying any such thing, though he would admit to it decades later in interviews.|$|E
500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some <b>men</b> <b>said</b> Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return quietly to her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were right to say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative.

According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the <b>men</b> <b>said</b> things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E
