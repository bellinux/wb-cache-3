2500|$|Vertical and {{horizontal}} tasting involves {{a range of}} vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter {{in which there is}} one vintage from <b>multiple</b> <b>vineyards.</b> [...] "Banana" [...] flavors (isoamyl acetate) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as [...] "medicinal" [...] or [...] "Band-Aid" [...] (4-ethylphenol), [...] "spicy" [...] or [...] "smoky" [...] (4-ethylguaiacol), and rotten egg (hydrogen sulfide). Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil. Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air. Vaporization of these compounds can be accelerated by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature. Many drinkers prefer to chill red wines that are already highly aromatic, like Chinon and Beaujolais.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, it was tragedy which gave birth to opportunity. The Western Cape wine farms had been devastated by a {{phylloxera}} epidemic in the 1880s & 1890s. Diseased <b>vineyards</b> were <b>ploughed</b> up and gradually replanted with vines grafted onto resistant American rootstock. In the meantime, farmers needed alternative forms of agriculture and the lucrative fruit industry in California provided a suitable model for the Cape. Pioneering work was done by fruit farmers in Wellington and the Hex River Valley. In 1892, shipping magnate Percy Molteno developed and introduced refrigerated cargo space on Union-Castle shipping lines, between the Cape and the largest consumer markets in Europe, which revolutionised the industry and made the export of fresh fruit an attractive proposition.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} how the proportional area {{of natural}} habitat surrounding a vineyard (i. e. landscape diversity) worked {{in conjunction with}} crop vigor, cultivar and rootstock selection to influence biological control of the western grape leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn). The key natural enemies of E. elegantula are Anagrus erythroneurae S. Trjapitzin & Chiappini and A. daanei Triapitsyn, {{both of which are}} likely impacted by changes in landscape diversity due to their reliance on non-crop habitat to successfully overwinter. Additionally, E. elegantula is sensitive to changes in host plant quality which may influence densities on specific cultivars, rootstocks and/or vines with increased vigor. From 2010 - 2013, data were collected on natural enemy and leafhopper densities, pest parasitism rates and vine vigor from <b>multiple</b> <b>vineyards</b> that represented a continuum of landscape diversity. Early in the season, vineyards in more diverse landscapes had higher Anagrus spp. densities and lower E. elegantula densities, which led to increased parasitism of E. elegantula. Although late season densities of E. elegantula tended to be lower in vineyards with higher early season parasitism rates and lower total petiole nitrogen content, they were also affected by rootstock and cultivar. While diverse landscapes can support higher natural enemy populations, which can lead to increased biological control, leafhopper densities also appear to be mediated by cultivar, rootstock and vine vigor...|$|R
50|$|The {{main title}} held by Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess of Palatinate, was Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey, {{seven years after}} taking her vows in 1660 AD. This {{occurred}} a little over one hundred years following the change of the Abbey from being an independent territory of the Holy Roman Empire to that of Lutheranism, specifically, Calvinism, due to the Electors of Brandenburg. She served as coadjutrix, or aid to the abbess, before her indoctrination. During her reign, she provided refuge for many sects, including Labadists and Quakers. Famous Quakers such as Robert Barclay, Jean de LaBadie and William Penn would visit Elisabeth while she was at Herford Abbey in attempts to convert her. There {{is the possibility that}} her niceties toward them were due to the political matters of the time, when many of the Quaker faith were attempting to reinstate the English throne. While being the head of the abbey, Elisabeth held a watchful eye over the <b>multiple</b> <b>vineyards,</b> farms, factories and mills that were attached to the abbey. This included approximately seven thousand people who helped run the daily tasks of the order and its subsidiaries until her death in 1680. However, Elisabeth of Bohemia was known to harbor a strong curiosity for scientific and religious theory, so it may in fact have been more than just a passing concern.|$|R
40|$|Land-use {{change is}} {{considered}} {{likely to be}} one of main drivers of biodiversity changes in grassland ecosystems. To gain insight into the impact of land use on the underlying soil bacterial communities, we aimed at determining the effects of agricultural management, along with seasonal variations, on soil bacterial community in a Mediterranean ecosystem where different land-use and plant cover types {{led to the creation of}} a soil and vegetation gradient. A set of soils subjected to different anthropogenic impact in a typical Mediterranean landscape, dominated by Quercus suber L., was examined in spring and autumn: a natural cork-oak forest, a pasture, a managed meadow, and two <b>vineyards</b> (<b>ploughed</b> and grass covered). Land uses affected the chemical and structural composition of the most stabilised fractions of soil organic matter and reduced soil C stocks and labile organic matter at both sampling season. A significant effect of land uses on bacterial community structure as well as an interaction effect between land uses and season was revealed by the EP index. Cluster analysis of culture-dependent DGGE patterns showed a different seasonal distribution of soil bacterial populations with subgroups associated to different land uses, in agreement with culture-independent T-RFLP results. Soils subjected to low human inputs (cork-oak forest and pasture) showed a more stable bacterial community than those with high human input (vineyards and managed meadow). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the predominance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes phyla with differences in class composition across the site, suggesting that the microbial composition changes in response to land uses. Taken altogether, our data suggest that soil bacterial communities were seasonally distinct and exhibited compositional shifts that tracked with changes in land use and soil management. These findings may contribute to future searches for bacterial bio-indicators of soil health and sustainable productivity.

40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{is characterized by}} specialized production {{and the use of}} monoculturecropping practices. These agroecosystems are at once concentrating habitat for crop pests andeliminating habitat for natural enemies. Multiple studies have demonstrated that such changescan lead to a decrease or total loss of biological control of pests. At the same time, expansion ofmonoculture cropping systems across entire agricultural regions has led to the creation oflandscapes that are entirely dominated by a small number of crops and devoid of naturalhabitats. In the same way, entire regions can experience a reduction or loss of biological controlto agriculture. As such, {{a number of studies have}} compared crop fields with high and low habitat diversity andfound that diversified cropping systems tend to have enhance natural enemy populations andincreased biological control of pests. At the same time, another set of studies have demonstratedthat monoculture cropping systems can still experience high levels of biological control so longas they are situated in a landscape with high levels of habitat diversity surrounding them. Morerecently, it has been proposed that the use of on-farm habitat diversification to enhancebiological control will likely be influenced by the area and quality of natural habitat surroundingthe farm (i. e. landscape diversity). This dissertation was designed to evaluate the influence of habitat diversity at the local andlandscape scale on biological control of the Western grape leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantulaOsborn; Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in North Coast wine grape vineyards. The key parasitoids of E. elegantula are Anagrus eryhthroneurae S. Trjapitzin & Chiappini and A. daanei Triapitsyn(Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). These Anagrus parasitoids are intimately tied to the natural habitatsthat surround vineyards due to the fact that in order for them to successfully overwinter theymust parasitize an alternate leafhopper host that overwinters in an egg stage (E. elegantulaoverwinters in the vineyard as an adult). These alternate leafhopper hosts are known to reside inthe natural and semi-natural habitats that surround North Coast vineyards. As such, it is thoughtthat biological control of E. elegantula in vineyards is particularly sensitive to changes inlandscape diversity. At the same time, the use of monoculture cropping practices results in avineyard environment that is very inhospitable to natural enemies of E. elegantula, includingAnagrus spp. Previous studies have demonstrated that without floral nectar (or an analogoussolution) the lifespan of Anagrus parasitoids can be less than two days and it may be that theintroduction of flowering cover crops into vineyards could possibly increase biological control ofE. elegantula by enhancing Anagrus longevity in the field. In this way, increased habitat diversityat both the field and landscape scale may support increased natural enemy populations whichwould lead to increased biological control of E. elegantula. For this dissertation, a series of studies were conducted in order to evaluate how changes inhabitat diversity at the field and landscape scale could affect natural enemy populations andultimately influence biological control of E. elegantula. First, overwintering habitat of Anagrusspp. was evaluated to identify the specific host plant species that contained leafhopper eggs thatthese parasitoids were attacking in natural habitats during the winter, as well as throughout therest of the year. Second, vineyards that were adjacent to riparian habitat were studied in orderto evaluate how distance away from a large natural habitat patch influenced the timing, densityand impact of natural enemies in the vineyard. Third, in order to isolate the influence oflandscape diversity, a multi-year study was conducted to monitor biological control of E. elegantula in a number of vineyard monocultures that were situated in low, intermediate andhigh diversity landscapes. Finally, over the course of several years the use of flowering summercover crops was developed in collaboration with commercial wine grape growers and vineyardtrials were subsequently conducted to evaluate the ability of these flowering cover crops toenhance biological control of E. elegantula. In order to evaluate how changes in the landscapeinfluenced the effectiveness of this on-farm habitat diversification practice, these cover cropstudies were conducted at <b>multiple</b> <b>vineyards</b> that were situated in low, intermediate and highdiversity landscapes. Results from these studies indicate that the area and composition of natural habitats surroundingvineyards can have a significant influence on biological control of E. elegantula. Reduced pestpopulations in more diverse landscapes is thought to be the result of both reduced crop vigor aswell as increased natural enemy impact during the overwintering period. Early seasonpopulations of Anagrus wasps were found in all vineyards regardless of landscape diversity,implying a strong dispersal capacity from overwintering sites. The Anagrus demonstrated astrong density dependent relationship with E. elegantula and this appeared to drive theirdensities in vineyards much more so than changes in landscape diversity...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in New York State to identify the major environmental and viticultural factors that influence 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP) evolution in grapes and to develop management strategies to control IBMP levels. Partial least squares regression was used to model the concentration of IBMP in berries at 50 days after anthesis (DAA, accumulation) and log-fold decrease in IBMP concentration from 50 DAA to harvest (degradation) as a function o f viticultural and environmental data collected from <b>multiple</b> Cabernet franc <b>vineyards</b> (10 in 2008 and 8 in 2009). The most important predictors for modeling IBMP accumulation were factors associated with vine vigor, and higher vigor {{was positively correlated with}} IBMP accumulation. IBMP degradation could not be satisfactorily modeled across multiple sites, but within sites, factors associated with vine vigor, crop to vine size, and fruit maturity were important predictors. In the warmer growing season (2008), IBMP concentrations at 50 DAA (range 2008 = 103 to 239 pg/g; range 2009 = 12 to 87 pg/g) were significantly higher than 2009 at all 8 sites. IBMP degradation was less in the cooler growing season, but harvest concentrations (range 2008 = 1 to 13 pg/g; range 2009 5 to 14 pg/g) were not significantly different between years at 5 out of 8 sites as a result of lower preveraison accumulation. Basal leaf removal treatments imposed preveraison reduced IBMP concentrations in Cabernet franc (34 to 88 %) and Merlo t (38 to 52 %) berries at harvest, but postveraison treatments were not efficacious. Shoot tipping and chlormequat treatments applied to Cabernet franc vines during the preveraison period altered vine growth and canopy density, but did not affect IBMP concentrations in berries at harvest. Clonal selection was evaluated as a potential tool to manage IBMP, but the Cabernet franc clones under study (1, 214, 312, 327) did not possess distinct characteristics that consistently resulted in differential vine growth and IBMP concentrations. These experiments suggest that high IBMP concentrations are likely to occur in vigorous sites where high preveraison temperatures are followed by poor ripening conditions. Preveraison basal leaf removal and managing for vine ba lance are potential strategies to control IBMP levels...|$|R
