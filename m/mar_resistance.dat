40|$|Scratch {{behavior}} on polymeric films was investigated. The effect of film orientation and architecture on scratch resistance was determined.

Model polypropylene (PP) and polyamide (PA) systems were employed to study the effect of laminate structure on scratch <b>resistance.</b> Also, <b>mar</b> {{behavior on}} bulk polymeric materials was investigated. The impact of brightness, transparency, and color as well as surface friction and texture on <b>mar</b> visibility <b>resistance</b> was determined. These studies were conducted based on fundamental, experimental, numerical, psychophysical, and statistical approaches. Experimental tests were conducted with accordance to ASTM/ISO standard. They were complemented by numerical simulations performed using a sophisticated FEM model. The psychophysical approach is performed through human observation tests to validate the experimental findings. The obtained data was analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) statistical approach. Scratch analysis demonstrates that scratch resistance is improved with higher film orientation and lower ethylene content. The FEM analysis shows that this improvement is associated with surface-to-interface shift of stress concentration. It is also found using the parametric analysis that scratch resistance is mainly improved due to higher film hardening coefficient and yield stress, but is insensitive to film modulus. It is also found that PP/PA has better scratch performance than PA/PP. This is mainly due to PP/PA low surface friction and graded structure, where upper PP layer absorbs scratch energy and lower PA layer protects the interface from high stress built-up. Mar analysis demonstrates that <b>mar</b> visibility <b>resistance</b> decreases with green, dark, smooth, and high-friction surfaces. Also, MDS results show that brightness, transparency, and color have respectively considerable, moderate, and insignificant effect on mar perception. Experimental findings indicate that <b>mar</b> visibility <b>resistance</b> can be quantified using the slope variation of mar contrast curve. FEM stress analysis shows that stress concentration is generated at the mar edge, then propagates towards inner mar area repetitively, reflecting stick-slip oscillations observed in experimental mar tests.

40|$|Thermoplastic polycarbonates {{are widely}} used in several {{manufacturing}} domains because of their extraordinary combination of transparency, toughness, ductility and chemical inertness at low and moderate temperature. They are, thus, ideal candidates to substitute float glasses, where lightweight and safety are of utmost relevance. In contrast, polycarbonates feature limited scratch and <b>mar</b> <b>resistance,</b> being characterized by very low surface hardness. This suggests the protection of polycarbonates with hard transparent coatings. However, poor interfacial adhesion between conventional coatings and polycarbonates, reduced cohesive strength of some hard coating materials and, in particular, their limited compliance when deposited on ductile substrates often reduce significantly their performance. In this respect, the present work analyzes {{the pros and cons}} of protecting thermoplastic polycarbonates with specialty coatings, emphasizing the real advantages of applying surface overlying layers and their drawbacks. Different formulations of the coatings were herein studied to optimize their interfacial adhesion with polycarbonates and cohesive strengths. Tribological (scratch, wear and mar) tests were, thus, performed to assess the performance of the coatings. After appropriate designing, specialty coatings might be useful to increase hardness and <b>mar</b> <b>resistance</b> of polycarbonates.

It was hypothesized that in Campylobacter jejuni, the efflux systems CmeABC, CmeDEF and the major outer membrane porin protein, MOMP (encoded by porA) could confer MAR. Methods: The expression of cmeB, cmeF and porA in 32 MAR C. jejuni isolated from humans or poultry was determined by comparative (C) -reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR and denaturing DHPLC. A further 13 ethidium bromide-resistant isolates and three control strains were also investigated. Accumulation of ciprofloxacin carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was also determined for all strains. Results: Although resistance to ethidium bromide {{has been associated with}} MAR, expression of all three genes was similar in the ethidium bromide-resistant isolates. These data indicate that CmeB, CmeF and MOMP play no role in resistance to this agent in C. jejuni. Six MAR isolates over-expressed cmeB, 3 / 32 over-expressed cmeB and cmeF. No isolates over-expressed cmeF alone. Expression of porA was similar in all isolates. All nine isolates that over-expressed cmeB contained a mutation in cmeR, substituting glycine 86 with alanine. All cmeB over-expressing isolates also accumulated low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, which were restored to wild-type levels in the presence of CCCP. Conclusions: These data indicate that over-expression of cmeB is associated with MAR in isolates of C. jejuni. However, as cmeB was over-expressed by only one-third (9 / 32) of MAR isolates, these data also indicate other mechanisms of MAR in C. jejuni...|$|R

Nevertheless, they feature very low surface hardness, scratch and <b>mar</b> <b>resistance.</b> Polycarbonates might be protected by the application of hard and tough surface overlying coatings. Indeed, scarce interfacial adhesion, poor cohesive strength and ductility of the hard coatings often compromise their performance in several applications.

However, these strategies are often extremely challenging and their cost or, simply, their practical implementation is highly demanding.

In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed hexamethylene diisocyanate/isophorone diisocyanate (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. Clearcoats were applied over conventional OEM basecoats (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and <b>mar</b> <b>resistance</b> and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent stain release properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE.

The risk of infection from contaminated food is worsened by the increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains. This study evaluated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella isolates (n?=? 263) from agricultural production systems through to the final packed product. Salmonella isolates were preliminarily identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) and API 20 E and identities confirmed by invA gene polymerase chain reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed with 15 antimicrobial agents using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion test. Of the 263 Salmonella isolates assessed, 59. 3 % were resistant {{to one or more}} antimicrobials. The most frequently detected resistance was against chloramphenicol and kanamycin (46. 7 %), trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (28 %), and streptomycin (14 %), and the less frequently detected resistance was toward ampicillin (1. 14 %), amikacin (0. 76 %), and amoxicillin clavulanic acid (0. 38 %). Multiple antimicrobial resistance (<b>MAR)</b> (<b>resistance</b> to ? 3 antibiotics) was found in 48. 7 % (76 / 156) isolates. The most common MAR phenotype was to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole kanamycin (43. 6 %). Resistance to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was only observed in MAR phenotypes. All isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and tetracycline. This study confirms the importance of fresh produce production environments as potential reservoirs and fresh produce as carriers of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella spp. with significant clinical importance.

E. coli isolates were tested against a panel of 12 antibiotics which included ampicillin, amoxicillin, amikacin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. In all samples, resistance to ampicillin (22. 7. 9 %), gentamicin (23. 6 %), amikacin (24 %), tetracycline (17. 4) and amoxicillin (16. 9 %) were the most frequently encountered form of resistance. However, a relatively higher proportion of isolates from pigeon faeces (67. 3 %) were antibiotic resistant than those from RHRW (53. 3 %). The highest number of phenotypes was observed for single antibiotics, and no single antibiotic resistance was observed for chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, cefoxitin, cotrimoxazole, although they were detected in multiple antibiotic <b>resistance</b> (<b>MAR)</b> phenotypes.

Salmonella Multiple Antibiotic <b>Resistance</b> (<b>MAR)</b> was detected in bile and gallbladder epitheliumfrom cattle slaughtered in a plant in southern state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under sanitary conditions. The frequency ofresistance to each drug was not significantly different between bile and epithelium, except in the case of cefotaxime, whichshowed increased resistance in the bile. Aztreonam was the most effective antibiotic for inhibiting strain growth. Since theresults showed Salmonella spp. strains resistant to twelve antimicrobials, it denotes an alarming risk, therefore in cases ofinvasive infections in both human and animals there will be reduction of therapeutic options against the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Alkyd/melamine resin {{mixtures}} {{are mainly}} used in industrial baking enamels. The {{effects of the}} alkyd/butylated melamine resin ratio (from 90 / 10 to 50 / 50) and curing temperature (from 110 to 180 °C) on the crosslinking and {{properties of the coating}} are presented in this paper. The curing reactions through functional groups of resins were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy. The hardness, elasticity, degree of adherence and gloss were also determined. Optimal coating properties could be achieved with an alkyd/melamine resin ratio of 80 / 20, a curing temperature of 150 °C and a curing time of 20 min. Organic coatings based on alkyd and melamine resins are high-quality industrial finishes. The combination of melamine-formaldehyde resins with suitable alkyd resin in surface coatings yields better hardness, <b>mar</b> and chemical <b>resistance,</b> improves weatherability, and reduces thermal curing times [1]. Alkyd-melamine resin blends are used mainly for the high-quality finishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{resistance}} of 200 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from seawater in Giresun Coasts (Black Sea) to 9 different antibiotics was investigated by agar diffusion methods. Antibiotic resistance levels of isolates was determined respectively, Erythromycin (E) : 82 %, Cefazolin (CZ) : 46. 50 %, Cefotaxime (CTX) : 50. 50 %, Amikacin (AK) : 41. 50 %, Nalidixic acid (NA) : 34. 50 %, Tetracycline (TE) : 30. 50 %, Chloramphenicol (C) : 36. 50 %, Cefuroxime (CXM) : 35. 50 % and Ampicillin (AM) : 15. 50 %. It was found that 2 isolates resistant to all antibiotics, 5 isolates sensitive and 91 % of all isolates multiple antibiotic <b>resistance</b> (<b>MAR)</b> index values were higher than 0. 2. It was concluded that bacteriological quality in Giresun coastal area could cause public health problems due to the not provided necessary hygiene and sanitation...|$|R

Urinary tract infection {{is one of}} the common infections in the Indian community. Distribution and susceptibility of UTI-causing pathogens change according to time and place. This study was conducted to determine the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in the Indian community as well as to determine the effect of gender and age on the etiology of bacterial uropathogens. Clean catch midstream urine samples were collected from 288 patients of the age ranging from 15 to ≥ 48 years. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed on all isolated bacteria by Kirby Bauer’s disc diffusion method. The multiple antibiotic <b>resistance</b> (<b>MAR)</b> index of each antibiotic was calculated. The UTI prevalence was 53. 82 % in patients; however, the prevalence was significantly higher in females than in males (females: 73. 57 %; males: 35. 14 %...|$|R
