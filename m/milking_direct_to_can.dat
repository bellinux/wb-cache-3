40|$|The CBO {{has been}} dealing with milk {{business}} by trading the same products of the same quality, using the same tools and techniques for milk selling over 40 years. In brief the CBO were purchasing and selling <b>milk</b> <b>direct</b> <b>to</b> the customers in fresh, boiled or fermented without any further transformations. That mode of business operations did not attract upward mobility of the CBO business that is why over that {{long period of time}} the CBO was still on the same pace. So, this situation attracted the author to build an interest of conducting this study so that it can come out with causative factors and find alternatives, which can help the CBO to go forward. So far, milk handling and quality control was found {{to be one of the}} burning issues (problem) of the CBO. To embark upon this situation, the CBO was assisted to develop and establish a project, which pave the way on how it can address the problem of milk handling and quality control. The project was developed after being acquainted with the goal, mission, overall and specific objectives of the CBO. Also developing and establishing of the CBO project came in hand after making a thorough study for the CBO business operations. Here the study analysed how the CBO conduct milk business, what are the strength and obstacles, which impede effectives of the entire business and upward mobility in terms business expansion and income enhancement. So, the study comes out with a project of capacity building by empowering the target group with knowledge and skills of milk marketing, entrepreneurship and best practice of milk business operations and management.

30|$|Because we {{also want}} to {{decrease}} the production of ammonia in the intestine, antibiotics <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> ammonia-producing bacteria <b>can</b> be used. Neomycin, rifaximin and metronidazol have been used (Shiano 2010). Rifaximin has good efficacy with less bacterial resistance and adverse effects than the other antibiotics, and thereby probably more cost-effective (Shiano 2010; Neff 2010).|$|R
40|$|Despite our {{knowledge}} of the protective role of antibodies passed to infants through breast milk, our understanding of immunity transfer via maternal leukocytes is still limited. To emulate the immunological interface between the mother and her infant while breast-feeding, we used murine pups fostered after birth onto MHC-matched and MHC-mismatched dams. Overall, data revealed that: 1) Survival of breast milk leukocytes in suckling infants is possible, but not significant after the foster-nursing ceases; 2) Most breast milk lymphocytes establish themselves in specific areas of the intestine termed Peyer's patches (PPs); 3) While most leukocytes in the milk bolus were myeloid cells, the majority of breast milk leukocytes localized to PPs were T lymphocytes, and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in particular; 4) These CTLs exhibit high levels of the gut-homing molecules α 4 β 7 and CCR 9, but a reduced expression of the systemic homing marker CD 62 L; 5) Under the same activation conditions, transferred CD 8 T cells through breast milk have a superior capacity to produce potent cytolytic and inflammatory mediators when compared to those generated by the breastfed infant. It is therefore possible that maternal CTLs found in breast <b>milk</b> are <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the PPs to compensate for the immature adaptive immune system of the infant in order to protect it against constant oral infectious risks during the postnatal phase...|$|R

Increased frequency of logging (380 hectares of production forests) and the use of fertilizers on pastures and forages (450 hectares) that sustain 750 cows, provide <b>direct</b> employment <b>to</b> 67 farmers and induce employment to more 50 actives, but also increases the eutrophycation and sedimentation of the lake. To address the issue an integrated model generates efficient land use scenarios for different degrees of phosphorus emissions with related effects in the water quality. The model is used to obtain various indicators for each scenario that feed a multi-objective program able to find the dominant solutions. The final solution is chosen by the politicians: 600 cows that produce 3. 0 millions of <b>milk,</b> provide <b>direct</b> employment <b>to</b> 55 farmers and induce employment to more 41 actives. This, jointly with a partial stream deviation, allows a reduction of 63 % of the phosphorus load to the lake.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{concern over the}} presence of Hg in fish consumed by humans. While studies have been focused on determining the Hg concentration in sport fish and some commercial fish, {{little attention has been}} <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> <b>canned</b> tuna; it is widely held that concentrations are low. In the present study, the amount of Hg present in canned tuna purchased in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, was examined, and the brand, temporal variation, type, and packaging medium impacts on Hg concentrations in tuna were explored. A significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) brand difference was noted: Brand 3 contained higher Hg concentrations (x̅ standard deviation (SD) (0. 777 +/- 0. 320 ppm) than Brands 1 (0. 541 +/- 0. 114 ppm) and 2 (0. 550 +/- 0. 199 ppm). Chunk white tuna (0. 619 +/- 0. 212 ppm) and solid white tuna (0. 576 +/- 0. 178 ppm) were both significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) higher in mean Hg than chunk light tuna (0. 137 +/- 0. 063 ppm).

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, Italian dairy farms, which gather, process and sell milk at the {{national}} level, have strengthened their leading market position at the detriment of dairy cooperatives, operating within regional borders. Moreover, decreasing milk prices and increasing production costs have recently induced many farmers to open automatic vending machines, dispensing raw <b>milk</b> for <b>direct</b> sale <b>to</b> local consumers. In order {{to contribute to the}} environmental assessment of alternative systems, this study estimated CO 2 emissions related to the transport from production farms to point of sale, for three brands of fresh milk currently sold in the Umbria region (Italy), starting from the food miles indicator as a simple concept, easily understood by consumers. These brands differ in the origin of milk (national, regional and local) and distribution channels (large-scale retail channels for national and regional brands and vending machines for the local one). Thus, we estimated the emissions generated by the transport of the fresh milk consumed by regional households. In agreement with previous studies about CO 2 emissions of foreign milk supply chains, the analysis showed that the production system of regional-branded milk, sold by retail channels, is the most efficient in terms of the environmental impact of transport...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} of emotions have {{provided us with}} explanations of how we emotionally engage with fiction, when we are aware that what is depicted is fictional. However, these theories left an important question unanswered: namely, what kinds of emotional responses to fiction are warranted responses. The main focus {{of this paper is}} how our emotional responses <b>to</b> fiction <b>can</b> be aesthetically warranted—that is, how emotions <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> fiction <b>can</b> be warranted given the fact that its object is an artwork. I consider three possible explanations of this phenomenon: the real‐life principle, a correspondence model, and a functional model. I argue that the real‐life principle and the correspondence model fall short of explaining how our emotional responses to film are aesthetically warranted, and instead I argue that a functional model provides such an explanation. In this paper, I will primarily focus on fiction films, although I will address novels and other art forms where necessary...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} report the occurrence of subclinical mastitis in a buffalo from a study carried out with 548 milk samples of 137 Murrah and Mediterranean buffalos from seven milk properties, located in the cities of Jau, Botucatu and Sorocaba, State of São Paulo. The animals {{of the study were}} submitted to a clinical examination of the mammary gland by the inspection and to the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical mastitis by California Mastitis Test (CMT), being the <b>milk</b> samples later <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the laboratory for microbiological studies and also to the test of Whiteside Modified (WSM). The isolated agents were identified by the morphological characteristics of its colonies and through microcultive staining with blue cotton. Two (02) pure fungi samples were isolated representing 2. 86 % of the total isolated microorganism, corresponding to two mammary rooms in one animal, and were classified as pertaining to the Aspergillus fumigatus specie. The animal in question showed reaction of ++ to the CMT in both affected rooms and negative reaction to the WSM. In this way it is concluded that the Aspergillus fumigatus participates in a discrete way as a determinant agent of bubaline subclinical mastitis, however it is important because the affected animals can act as potential reservoirs and may be able to generate the infection in human beings...|$|R
