5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate.

5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying {{to reach an agreement}} under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{chaos of}} the civil war brought the introduction of legal tender notes, backed only by the credit of the government, and by mid-1862, gold and silver coins had vanished from circulation in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps. The three-cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins, apparently because the public thought it was still made of debased silver, but by the autumn of 1862, it too was hoarded. With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate, mintage of the three-cent silver dropped from 343,000 in 1862 to 21,000 in 1863, a figure that would be exceeded only once (22,000 in 1866) {{during the rest of the}} series. In March 1863, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase wrote in a letter that the three-cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation, and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding.|$|E
