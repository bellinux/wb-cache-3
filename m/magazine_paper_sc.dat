40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{refining}} trial was conducted using the ATMP (Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp) refining concept with White spruce as raw material. Low-intensity TMP and high-intensity TMP with mechanical pre-treatment of chips {{were compared to}} ATMP (Mg+P), where development of fibres was enhanced using hydrogen peroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The main goal of the trial was to evaluate the potential of using ATMP process for production of SC (supercalendered) <b>magazine</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>SC</b> paper is especially demanding {{when it comes to}} the paper surface structure which is strongly influenced by the development of fibre properties. Improvement in individual fibre properties such as flexibility, fibre split index and fibre surface area index achieved using ATMP process was found to translate into decreased surface roughness and air permeability of calendered laboratory sheets. Both the refining process configuration and the addition of process chemicals were found to have significant impacts though the process configuration had major role. The influence of process chemicals on PPS was mainly pronounced after second stage refining. The magnitude of surface roughening (fibre rising) was found to be influenced mainly by the process configuration...|$|E

PM4 was planned to produce <b>magazine</b> <b>paper,</b> but was dependent on the thermal power station to receive sufficient power. Between the two investments were stipulated to between NOK7 and 8 billion. The investments were placed on hold of several factors. One was a general decline in the demand for paper, and general increasing costs in Norway, making Noske Skog prefer investments in their foreign mills. Another reason was that Norske Skog spent most of its capital purchasing foreign mills {{in an attempt to}} become a dominant worldwide manufacturer of newsprint and <b>magazine</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R

40|$|PCC {{has become}} the {{preferred}} solution in uncoated woodfree papers and is now expanding into woodcontaining <b>papers,</b> specifically <b>SC</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>papers.</b> The replacement of kaolin fillers with CaCO 3 has been slower in wood-containing paper grades than in wood-free papers. This is mainly due to alkaline darkening and printability {{issues related to the}} higher permeability and rounded shape of calcium carbonate fillers. However, these obstacles can be overcome by applying new engineered calcium carbonates designed to improve printing properties. This paper is focusing on the interactions between filler types (engineered precipitated calcium carbonates and kaolin) and paper structure, in particular the Z-direction filler distribution on gravure print through of SC-papers. Good printability in terms of low strike through and high ink hold out {{is a result of the}} ink staying on the surface of the paper – it is a paper surface property. Consequently, only filler present at or close to the surface can impact good ink strike through and hold out. But different formers can give significant differences in Z-direction filler distribution. These filler distributions were simulated in a Dynamic Sheet Former (DSF) by adjusting the filler dosing rate during the sheet forming process...|$|R

30|$|In summary, we {{fabricated}} <b>SCs</b> on Xerox <b>paper</b> using {{pencil drawing}} and PPy deposition successfully. The thin graphite sheets drawn by pencil {{acted as a}} good EDLC material and a good current collector. The SCs based on PPy-G-paper electrodes showed high specific capacitance of 52.9  F cm− 3 at a scan rate of 1  mV s− 1. In addition, three SCs connected in series can drive a commercial LED. This method of fabricating the energy storage devices is of low cost and environment friendly, and the <b>paper</b> <b>SCs</b> can potentially guide the development of paper electronics for its low cost and high compatibility.|$|R
