25|$|Words {{derived from}} the Tupi {{language}} are particularly prevalent in place names (Itaquaquecetuba, Pindamonhangaba, Caruaru, Ipanema, Paraíba). The native languages also contributed the names {{of most of the}} plants and animals found in Brazil (and most of these are the official names of the animals in other Portuguese-speaking countries as well), including arara ("macaw"), jacaré ("South American alligator"), tucano ("toucan"), <b>mandioca</b> ("cassava"), abacaxi ("pineapple"), and many more. However, many Tupi–Guarani toponyms did not derive directly from Amerindian expressions, but were in fact coined by European settlers and Jesuit missionaries, who used the Língua Geral extensively in the first centuries of colonization. Many of the Amerindian words entered the Portuguese lexicon as early as in the 16th century, and some of them were eventually borrowed into other European languages.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the cakes}} and {{appetizers}} {{of the local}} cuisine use corn or cassava (known there as <b>mandioca)</b> flour instead of wheat, as the latter did not adapt well to the local weather. The best-known dish from Minas Gerais is [...] "pão de queijo", a small baked roll (known internationally as [...] "Brazilian cheese rolls") made with cheese and cassava flour that can be served hot as an appetizer or for breakfast.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definitive}} breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock {{would be}} up to the band Los Gatos. After playing in [...] "La Cueva" [...] for a few months (and members of the band being arrested on a regular basis by police, for political reasons), the band released two singles in 1967. [...] "La Balsa", a sunny track vaguely reminiscent of The Doors, was composed by Tanguito and sold 200,000 copies. The following year saw the first publication of Pinap, a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, <b>Mandioca.</b> In 1969, four major concerts of so-called [...] "música beat" [...] ("beat music") were held: the June Sunday concerts, Festival Nacional de Música Beat, Festival Pinap and Festival de Música Joven.|$|E

60|$|It is {{impossible}} to describe minutely {{the appearance of the}} motley crowd, through which our adventurers elbowed their way, gazing curiously on the strange scene, which seemed to them more like a dream than reality, after their long sojourn in the solitudes of the forest. Processions headed by long-robed priests with flambeaux and crucifixes; young girls in light costumes and long white cotton shawls, selling sweet cakes of <b>mandioca</b> flour, and bonbons; swarthy Brazilians, some in white jackets, loose cotton drawers, and straw-hats, others in brown leather boots and ponchos; Negroes in short white drawers and shifts, besides many without any clothing above their waists; Indians from the interior, copper-coloured, and some of them, fine-looking men, having only a strip of cloth about their loins;--such were the strange crew whose loud voices added to the whiz of rockets, squibs, crackers, guns, and musical instruments, created a deafening noise.|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at the Indian village Martin was given to understand, by signs, {{that he was to}} reside with a {{particular}} family, and work every day in the maize and <b>mandioca</b> fields, besides doing {{a great deal of the}} drudgery of the hut; so that he now knew he was regarded as a slave by the tribe into whose hands he had fallen. It is impossible to express the bitterness of his feelings at this discovery, and for many weeks he went about his work scarcely knowing what he did, and caring little, when the hot sun beat on him so fiercely that he could hardly stand, whether he lived or died. At length, however, he made up his mind firmly to attempt his escape. He was sitting beneath the shade of his favourite resort, the tamarind-tree, when he made this resolve. Longing thoughts of home had been strong upon him all that day, and desire for the companionship of Barney had filled his heart to bursting; so that the sweet evening sunshine and the beautiful vale over which his eyes wandered, instead of affording him pleasure, seemed but to mock his misery. It was a lesson that all must learn sooner or later, and one we would do well to think upon before we learn it, that sunshine in the soul is not dependent on the sunshine of this world, and when once the clouds descend, the brightest beams of all that earth contains cannot pierce them,--God alone can touch these dark clouds with the finger of love and mercy, and say again, as He said of old, [...] "Let there be light." ...|$|E
60|$|After three days' {{travelling}} {{we arrived}} at Socêgo, the estate of Senhôr Manuel Figuireda, a relation {{of one of our}} party. The house was simple, and, though like a barn in form, was well suited to the climate. In the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls, thatched roof, and windows without glass. The house, together with the granaries, the stables, and workshops for the blacks, who had been taught various trades, formed a rude kind of quadrangle; in the centre of which a large pile of coffee was drying. These buildings stand on a little hill, overlooking the cultivated ground, and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green luxuriant forest. The chief produce of {{this part of the country}} is coffee. Each tree is supposed to yield annually, on an average, two pounds; but some give as much as eight. <b>Mandioca</b> or cassava is likewise cultivated in great quantity. Every part of this plant is useful: the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses, and the roots are ground into a pulp, which, when pressed dry and baked, forms the farinha, the principal article of sustenance in the Brazils. It is a curious, though well-known fact, that the juice of this most nutritious plant is highly poisonous. A few years ago a cow died at this Fazênda, in consequence of having drunk some of it. Senhôr Figuireda told me that he had planted, the year before, one bag of feijaô or beans, and three of rice; the former of which produced eighty, and the latter three hundred and twenty fold. The pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle, and the woods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days. This profusion of food showed itself at dinner, where, if the tables did not groan, the guests surely did; for each person is expected to eat of every dish. One day, having, as I thought, nicely calculated so that nothing should go away untasted, to my utter dismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial reality. During the meals, it was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds, and dozens of little black children, which crawled in together, at every opportunity. As long as the idea of slavery could be banished, there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and patriarchal style of living: it was such a perfect retirement and independence from the rest of the world. As soon as any stranger is seen arriving, a large bell is set tolling, and generally some small cannon are fired. The event is thus announced to the rocks and woods, but to nothing else. One morning I walked out an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene; at last, the silence was broken by the morning hymn, raised on high by the whole body of the blacks; and in this manner their daily work is generally begun. On such fazêndas as these, I have no doubt the slaves pass happy and contented lives. On Saturday and Sunday they work for themselves, and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week.|$|E

The album's rendition of La Balsa has a spoken word introduction by Manal's Javier Martínez in which he repeats: [...] "you composed La Balsa in the washroom of La Perla del Once". Martínez was in the studio for the recording but did not participate, and uttered the words for dramatic effect. The emphasis created friction with Nebbia, who felt that <b>Mandioca</b> was claiming Tanguito was the song's sole author. The rift subsided over time, but Nebbia remained a jealous custodian of his own rights.|$|E

50|$|When Tanguito {{broke with}} RCA {{he found a}} new home in <b>Mandioca,</b> a label {{dedicated}} exclusively to rock, which immediately arranged for studio time. But he had trouble motivating himself to complete an album. Typically, Tanguito would record one or two song sketches alone with his guitar, or jam with available musicians, and disappear for days. By that time he had switched from alcohol and casual marijuana use to hard drugs, and was injecting amphetamines whenever he could afford them.|$|E
50|$|He {{continued}} composing and performing, {{and though}} he struggled, his single, Ayer nomás (Only Yesterday) {{was made into a}} local hit by Los Gatos.
