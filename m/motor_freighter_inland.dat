50|$|Goya was a Norwegian <b>motor</b> <b>freighter.</b> Completed in 1940 for Johan Ludwig Mowinckel Rederi company, she {{was named}} after Francisco de Goya. Following the {{invasion}} of Norway she was seized by Germany and pressed into service of the Kriegsmarine as a troop transport.|$|R
500|$|U-38 sank six ships. First sent to {{the bottom}} was the neutral Irish steam trawler [...] on 9 March, with a single shell at point-blank range off Tory Island, all 11 crew were lost. The Leukos was fishing {{in the company of}} British trawlers; it has been speculated that she {{positioned}} herself between the surfacing U-boat and the fleeing British in the belief that her neutral markings would protect her. This event was followed by the sinking of the Danish <b>motor</b> <b>freighters</b> SS Argentina on 17 March and SS Algier and SS Christiansborg on 21 March. The Norwegian <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> MV Cometa was sunk on 26 March. The sixth and final ship sunk during this third patrol was the Finnish steam freighter SS Signe on 2 April. After nearly six weeks on the high seas, U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 5 April 1940.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, S.G. Simpson was {{chartered}} by Puget Sound Freight Lines {{to replace}} their new <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> Rubaiyat, which had capsized and sunk in Tacoma harbor in late September after {{taking on a}} load of gypsum, killing four of her crew. In 1926 Puget Sound Freight Lines purchased S.G. Simpson outright, keeping on her officers, George Melville, master, John Jones, mate, John Leslie, Chief Engineer, and George Foss, purser.|$|R
500|$|U-38 {{would spend}} {{two and a}} half months in port, before leaving for {{operations}} off the west coast of Africa on 9 April 1941. This would prove to be her most successful patrol, with the sinking of eight ships. On 4 May, the Swedish steam freighter SS Japan was torpedoed while traveling with Convoy OB-310 from England to the United States. The following day, the British <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> MV Queen Maud was hit and sunk. On 23 May, the Dutch <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> SS Berhala was sunk while traveling with the Convoy OB 318, from England to America. The British steam freighter SS Vulcain was torpedoed and sunk on 24 May. Six days later, on 29 May, the British steam freighter SS Tabaristan was another victim. The following day the destruction continued, the British steam freighter SS Empire Protector was sent to the bottom, as was the Norwegian steam freighter SS Rinda on the 31st. The eighth and final ship sunk during U-38 eighth patrol was the British cargo steamship [...] on 8 June. The boat then returned to Lorient on 29 June 1941, after spending eleven and a half weeks at sea.|$|R
5|$|U-38 would depart Lorient with Liebe {{in command}} {{once again on}} 18 December 1940. The eighth war patrol of her career would involve {{operations}} again in the Northwest Approaches. During this patrol, the submarine would hit and sink two ships. On 27 December, U-38 destroyed the British ship SS Waiotira, and on 31 December, she sank the Swedish <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> SS Valparaiso, sailing {{as part of the}} HX-97 convoy from Halifax to Glasgow. U-38 returned to port on 22 January 1941.|$|R
5|$|For {{her first}} patrol from Lorient and her seventh overall, U-38 would again {{be under the}} command of Heinrich Liebe. She {{departed}} on 25 September, for the Northwest Approaches. She would attack five ships on this patrol, sinking four of them. On 1 October, the British <b>motor</b> <b>freighter</b> MV Highland Patriot was torpedoed. After two weeks of no victories, U-38 was successful against the Greek steam freighter SS Aenos on 17 October, sailing as part of Convoy SC 7, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to England. The following day, the British steam freighter SS Carsbreck was damaged, but not sunk, while traveling with the SC-7 convoy from Sydney to Grimsby, England. On 19 October, two ships were hit, both sailing as part of the HX 79 convoy: the Dutch SS Bilderdijk and the British steam freighter SS Matheran. Following these victories, U-38 returned to Lorient on 24 October 1940.|$|R
50|$|At the start, the rum-runner fleet {{consisted}} of a ragtag flotilla of fishing boats such as the schooner Nellie J. Banks, excursion boats, and small merchant craft. But as prohibition wore on, the stakes got higher and the ships became larger and more specialized. Converted fishing ships like McCoy's Tomoka waited on Rum Row and were soon joined by small <b>motor</b> <b>freighters</b> custom-built in Nova Scotia for rumrunning, with low, grey hulls, hidden compartments and powerful wireless equipment. Examples include the Reo II. Specialized high-speed craft were built for the ship-to-shore runs. These high-speed boats were often luxury yachts and speedboats fitted with powerful aircraft engines, machine guns, and armor plating. Often, builders of rum-runners' ships also supplied Coast Guard vessels (such as Fred and Mirto Scopinich's Freeport Point Shipyard). Rum-runners often kept cans of used engine oil handy to pour on hot exhaust manifolds, in case a smoke screen was needed to escape the revenue ships.|$|R
50|$|Ghana's Volta River, Ankobra River, and Tano River provide 168 km of {{perennial}} navigation for launches and lighters, and Volta Lake provides 1,125 kilometres of arterial and feeder waterway. There are {{two main}} seaports in Ghana which {{are located in the}} southern coastal cities of Sekondi-Takoradi and Tema (Takoradi Harbour and Tema Harbour). The strategic geographical location of Ghana to the Volta Lake and the many rivers of Ghana that provide inland transport make Ghana a very transited sovereign state for <b>freighters.</b> <b>Inland</b> water transport in Ghana includes the movement of passengers by ferry or water taxis and cargo on rivers, lakes and other water bodies in Ghana and Ghana has a ferry transportation system on Volta Lake at Yeji and Kwadjokrom. The Volta Lake is the major inland water transport facility that is efficiently regulated to transport passengers and cargo. The main transport service provider on the Volta Lake is the Volta Lake Transport Company Limited (VLTC). The Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority and Ghana Railway Corporation and the Volta River Authority collectively have oversight responsibility over the Volta Lake and the Volta Lake Transport Company Limited (VLTC).|$|R
50|$|In 1957 a new <b>motor</b> vessel, the <b>freighter</b> Llantrisant was {{delivered}} by Bartram's of Sunderland {{while in the}} following year the oil tanker Llanishen {{was delivered}} from Swan Hunters yard at Wallsend-on-Tyne. In 1960 the tanker Hamilton, built at Tamise, Belgium, was delivered on time charter and the tanker Llangorse built by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Haverton Hill was delivered. In October 1962 the freighter Llanwern was delivered by Bartrams of Sunderland.|$|R
