40|$|AbstractThe {{disposal}} of food waste {{is a large}} environmental problem. In the United Kingdom (UK), approximately 15 million tonnes of food are wasted each year, mostly disposed of in landfill, via composting, or anaerobic digestion (AD).

This study investigates the potential benefits of diverting food waste for <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> in the UK. A hybrid, consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to compare the environmental and health impacts of four technologies for food waste processing: two technologies of South Korean style-animal feed production (as a wet <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> and a dry <b>pig</b> <b>feed)</b> were compared with two widespread UK disposal technologies: AD and composting.

The low impact of food waste feed stems in large part from its substitution of conventional feed, the production of which has substantial environmental and health impacts.

Methods and Results: Pigs were fed a diet that varied only by their processing (pellet or mash) and their particle size (500, 750 or 1250  μm) for 21  days. Salmonella detection in faeces and seroconversion were determined. Faecal microbiota was assessed by Ion Torrent amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR. Significantly fewer pigs (P <  0 · 05) shed Salmonella in the groups fed mash 500 (1) and mash or pellet 1250 (5 each) compared to the commercial reference group (15) fed pellet 500. Both mash processing and large particle size raised the proportion and number of bacteria from the Bifidobacterium genus in the faecal microbiota of the pigs.

40|$|The swine {{industry}} in China has grown rapidly over last two decades. Great amount of pig manure is generated in China, {{which can be}} used as organic fertilizers on agricultural lands. Meanwhile, the organic arsenic compounds have been used as feed additives for swine disease control and weight improvement. Once the excessive additives are released in the environment, arsenic may compromise food safety and environmental quality. There is a growing public concern about the arsenic residues accumulation in pig manure, however, little work has been done to investigate the exact arsenic content in <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> and the residues in manure in China This study investigates the concentrations of arsenic in 29 <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> samples and 29 manure samples collected from eight pig farms in the Chaoyang district, Beijing city. The detected rate of arsenic in 29 couples of samples was 100 %. The concentrations of arsenic in <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> and manures ranged from 0. 15 to 37. 8 mg/kg and 0. 42 to 119. 0 mg/kg, respectively. The result showed that arsenic concentration in pig manure will be greatly elevated when the arsenic in <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> was largely increased. The loading rates of pig manure in fourteen Beijing counties and districts were in the range of 2. 7 - 57. 2 t/ha yr. Accordingly, the potential soil arsenic increase rates resulting from land application of pig manure might range between 11. 8 and 78. 9 μg/kg yr. Despite these findings, {{it is too early to}} draw the conclusion that arsenic pollution from pig manure is serious in Beijing farmland; therefore, longitudinal studies about the chemical form transformation and the environmental behaviors of pig manure arsenic are required in order to come up with more definitive conclusions. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Limited {{access to}} quality feeds and {{reliable}} feed supply are amongst the priority constraints of smallholder pig production in Uganda. Among the <b>feeds</b> given to <b>pigs,</b> sweetpotato (SP), banana and other root tubers residues are common. However, information on farmers’ perceptions and practices {{on the proper}} use of these residues for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> is limited. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing those aspects, as well as to identify opportunities for better use of these residues in the pig-SP systems. A qualitative survey was undertaken in Masaka and Kamuli, two districts of Uganda with high pig population and SP production. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews (KII) were undertaken with 80 small scale pig and SP producers and 24 key informants. Results from this study revealed that the majority of pig farmers in those districts use SP and other RTB crop residues as animal feed. During the rainy season, farmers scored high the utilization of SP crop residues, with the latter being the leading contributor to the pig diet especially in the rural area. SP crop residues are usually fed to pigs fresh without processing. Among the residues, fresh raw vines represent the largest part fed to pig (70 %), as compared to roots and peels. The way these residues are offered vary, for example in peri-urban areas with easier access to commercial feeds, farmers feed the crop residues mixed with concentrates; whereas in rural areas with limited access to commercial feeds, crop residues tend to be given without supplementation. However, the full potential of SP and other RTB crop residues for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> is not yet fully exploited as farmers accept that a large amount is wasted (37 % in Masaka and 40 % in Kamuli). In Masaka, the proportion of SP crop residues utilized at household level mostly for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> was 40 %, while in Kamuli was 52 %. This study demonstrated that there is potential for better use of SP and other RTB crop residues as <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> in the smallholder pig farming systems in Uganda, but the major constraint as pointed out by farmers is the poor access to technologies for preserving these resources. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} further exploration of strategies for conserving SP and other RTB crop residues during the harvesting period for use in <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> during times of feed scarcity.

40|$|Pre-slaughter {{handling}} has {{a significant}} effect on meat quality, depending on the severity of the stress and the consequent changes in the metabolic activities in the muscle. Pigs can be stressed at any point, starting from loading at the farm to slaughter. The level of stress is mostly dependent on the genotype of the pig, with higher levels in PSS and RN gene carrier pigs. Resting time in the barn prior to slaughter can range from at least 2 - 4 hours to overnight and it is influenced by the genetics of the <b>pig,</b> <b>feed</b> withdraw time and distance of transportation.

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> {{has a major}} contribution to climate change, energy use and land occupation impacts of the animal product. Nonetheless, the traditional least-cost (LC) feed formulation methods minimize {{the cost of the}} feed mix, without consideration of its environmental impacts. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the potential mitigation of environmental impacts calculated by Life Cycle Assessment through a multi-objective formulation of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds,</b> in the French context. The linear programming problem built searches the best feed formula under nutritional constraints with a multi-objective function including an economic price index (price of the feed mix relative to LC formulation) and an environmental impacts index (environmental impacts relative to LC formulation). A weighting coefficient between price and environment (α) ranging from 0 to 1 was included. Growing and finishing feeds were formulated with two scenarios of feed ingredients availability (current limited LIM, increased NLIM) and 4 scenarios of feed ingredient prices. When increasing α from 0 to 0. 5, the environmental indexes of the growing and finishing feeds dropped down to - 10 % in LIM and down to - 17 to - 20 % in NLIM scenario, respectively. Concomitantly, the average feed price increased by 1. 5 % in LIM and 1. 7 % in NLIM. For α higher than 0. 5, the environmental index was almost no further reduced. At α= 0. 5, all the impacts considered were reduced relatively to LIM-LC, excepted for land occupation in NLIM. The low-impact feeds incorporated higher proportions of pea and wheat middlings and lower proportions of meals (rapeseed and sunflower) than LC formulated feeds. The multi-objective formulation of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> is an efficient methodology to find low-impact feeds according to a given economic scenario. Improving the availability of some feed ingredients (pea, co-products of wheat…) at the territory level would allow (at same feed’s nutritional composition) further reduction of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> impacts relatively to the current French context.
