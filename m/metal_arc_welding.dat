5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{dissertation}} is related to a study of the failure mechanisms of gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds.</b> Cost savings can be gained by minimizing the weld length. However, improperly sized welds can result in the loss of structural integrity of the welded components. The necking/shear failure modes for the mid-sections of gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds</b> in lap-shear specimens of HSLA steel are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed with the geometric characteristics of the heat affected zones (HAZ) designed to match the micrographs of the cross sections for the welds. The distributions of the void volume fraction near the welds shown from the finite element analyses are consistent with the failure modes observed in the experiments. Further finite element analyses showed that the geometric characteristics of the HAZ are key factors for the resulting failure location. The mode I and mode II stress intensity factor (SIF) solutions for gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds</b> in lap-shear specimens are investigated by the analytical solutions and by finite element analyses. The computational results indicate that the SIF solutions for realistic welds are lower than the analytical solutions for idealized weld geometry. Further finite element analyses were carried out in order to obtain the computational SIF solutions for the realistic weld geometries with dissimilar sheet thicknesses. Finally, three-dimensional computational results indicate that the distributions of the SIF solutions for discontinuous welds are different from those for continuous welds. In the second part, a computational model is developed for simulations of representative volume element specimens of lithium-ion battery modules under in-plane constrained compression tests. The model allows for computational efficiency while simulating the overall mechanical response of battery modules and the deformation patterns of the heat dissipater. The model is based on the properties of the heat dissipater, the foam, and the macro behavior of the cell components. The computational results compare fairly well with the experimental results. Further finite element analyses showed the increase in the initial nominal buckling stress under dynamic loading conditions...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SMAW); it is also known as manual <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E

40|$|In various applications, welding-induced {{residual}} stresses {{have a substantial}} impact on the integrity of welded constructions.

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

This can be attributed to the formation of oxygen, which lowers the partial pressure of hydrogen in the arc atmosphere, and the reaction of FeO (formed on dissociation of MIO) with hydrogen. The partitioning of deoxidizing elements (manganese and silicon) between the weld metal and slag on addition of MIO to the flux coating was also examined, but the influence of flux additions on the weld mechanical properties and the electrode operating characteristics was not evaluated during the course of this investigation...|$|R
