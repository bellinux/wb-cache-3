5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, but not as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition {{is similar to that}} of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

The hindquarters are powerful, although not so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the modern}} languages, Icelandic {{is the closest}} to Old Norse. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse phonemic writing system.

It is interesting to see that a relatively lower number of haplotypes were found in this region as compared with Oncomelania hupensis hupensis. It appears likely that there has been certain degree of isolation for these mountainous populations.|$|E

In the following descriptions of the principal musical items in both the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Office and Mass, some of these analogies will be discussed further.
