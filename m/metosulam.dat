40|$|Water {{scarcity}} is a {{major cause}} of crops yield reduction {{in many parts of the}} world. So, a more rational use of irrigation water should be adapted and deficit irrigation principles should be accepted with a certain level of reduction in yield level. To study the efficiency of four water requirements (100 % whole season, 75 % whole season, 50 % whole season and 100 % whole season while 50 % at grain-filling stage) and five weed-control treatments (three postemergence herbicides i. e., <b>metosulam,</b> tribenuron-methyl, and bromoxynil), hand weeding and unweeded check, and their interactive effects, two field experiments on wheat crop were conducted in two successive seasons at the agricultural experimental station of the National Research Centre, Nubaria, Egypt. Bromoxynil, tribenuron-methyl came in the first order for controlling total broad-leaved weeds. Application of 100 % water requirement recorded the highest values compared to all other irrigation water treatments in term of flag-leaf area, chlorophyll content, plant height, number of spike/m 2, spike weight, grains number/spike, weight of 1, 000 grains, yield and yield attributes of wheat. <b>Metosulam</b> followed by bromoxynil, tribenuron-methyl and hand-weeding treatments gave higher values of grain yield/ha. The highest grain yield, protein and carbohydrates percentages of wheat grains were obtained from addition of 100 % water requirement with <b>metosulam</b> treatment was used followed by 75 % of water requirement combined with <b>metosulam</b> treatment without significant difference among these treatments...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{determination}} {{of a group of}} triazolopyrimidine sulfoanilide herbicides (cloransulam-methyl, <b>metosulam,</b> flumetsulam, florasulam and diclosulam) in soy milk by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is presented. The main electrospray interface (ESI) parameters (nebulizer pressure, dry gas flow rate, dry gas temperature and composition of the sheath liquid) are optimized using a central composite design. To increase the sensitivity of the CE-MS method, an off-line sample preconcentration procedure based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) is combined with an on-line stacking procedure (i. e. normal stacking mode, NSM). Samples could be injected up to 100 seconds, providing limits of detection (LODs) down to 74 Î¼g/L, i. e., in the low ppb level, with relative standard deviation values (RSD,...|$|E
40|$|According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has {{reviewed}} the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) currently established at European {{level for the}} pesticide active substance <b>metosulam.</b> In order to assess the occurrence of metosulamresidues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock, EFSA considered the conclusions derived {{in the framework of}} Directive 91 / 414 /EEC as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (incl. the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, MRL proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was found to be missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and some MRL proposals derived by EFSA still require further consideration by risk managers...|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{and molecular}} basis {{of resistance to}} acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting herbicides was investigated in eight resistant (R) and three susceptible (S) wild radish populations. In vitro enzyme assays revealed an ALS herbicide-resistant ALS enzyme in all R populations. ALS enzyme extracted from the shoots of all eight R populations was highly resistant to the ALS-inhibiting sulfonylurea herbicide chlorsulfuron (20 - to 160 -fold) and the triazolopyrimidine herbicide <b>metosulam</b> (10 - to 46 -fold) and moderately resistant to metsulfuron (three to eightfold). There was little or no cross-resistance to the imidazolinone herbicides imazapyr and imazethapyr. The ALS gene fragment covering potential mutation sites in these populations was amplified, sequenced, and compared. All eight R populations had point mutations in the codon for the proline residue in Domain A. However, the point mutations varied and encoded four different amino acid substitutions: histidine, threonine, alanine, and serine. No nucleotide difference in the DNA sequence of Domains C and D resulting in amino acid substitutions was observed between the R and S populations examined. In addition, a three- to fivefold higher ALS-specific activity was consistently observed in all R populations compared with S populations, whereas Northern blot analysis detected a similar level of ALS mRNA, suggesting a possible translational-posttranslational regulation of the enzyme. It is concluded that selection pressure from chlorsulfuron on eight separate wild radish populations has resulted in target site mutation at the same proline residue in the ALS gene. Higher ALS activity also {{may play a role}} in the resistance level...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} determination of selected maize and grain herbicides (amidosulfuron, N-([{[(4, 6 -dimethoxy- 2 -pyrimidinyl) amino]carbonyl}amino) sulfonyl]-N-methylmethanesulfonamide; bentazone, 3 -(1 -methylethyl) - 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one 2, 2 -dioxide; 2, 4 -D, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid; MCPA, (4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) acetic acid; <b>metosulam,</b> N-(2, 6 '-dichloro- 3 -methylphenyl) - 5, 7 -dimethoxy[1, 2, 4]triazolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidine- 2 -sulfonamide) and their transformation products (TPs) (8 -hydroxybentazone, 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one, 8 -hydroxy- 3 -(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 2 -dioxide; bifenox acid, 5 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) - 2 -nitrobenzoic acid; clodinafop acid; 2, 4 -dichlorophenol; 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol) in environmental waters was developed. The procedure combines a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with column liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection utilizing a pneumatically assisted and heat-assisted electrospray interface in negative mode. The extraction of analytes from filtered drainage or river water samples was performed using as sorbent a graphitized carbon. The recovery, for drinking water, ranged from 91 to 98 %, and from 84 to 95 % for river water. Excellent method precision was demonstrated with percent {{relative standard deviation}} of less than 10 % for all analytes at fortification level. Detection limits were at level of few nanograms per liter, except for 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol, {{that was in the}} range of tens of nanogram per liter. The present methodology was used for searching in river and drainage waters of maize-grain fields of the Tiber valley, during a typical period of herbicides application from April to July 2001. The levels detected of four compounds were in the range of: non-detectable (ND) - 6. 1, ND- 27, ND- 1. 9 and ND- 0. 5 mug l(- 1), for MCPA, bentazone, 8 -hydroxybentazone and 2, 4 -D, respectively. Detectable amounts of bentazone- 8 -hydroxy at level of 0, 3 mug l(- 1) was found to be transported into river. The highly satisfactory results for all target analytes demonstrate the potential of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and the quantification of the polar and acidic herbicides at below 100 ng l(- 1) levels.
