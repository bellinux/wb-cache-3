50|$|One way to {{minimize}} thermal stress {{is to maintain}} temperature and pressure in the cockpit within acceptable ranges, using a cockpit temperature management system. However, one problem with this system is that it works by measuring the dry bulb temperature of surrounding air without taking radiant temperature and humidity into account. Radiant heat rises when operating at low altitudes because of the greenhouse effect and kinetic heating {{on the surface of}} the aircraft. Furthermore, if cockpit temperature exceeds skin temperature, which is 33 degrees Celsius, the pilot will sweat, leading to increased humidity as the sweat evaporates. Today, the Air Force uses a more advanced air-cooling system that assesses pilots' <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature</b> and wet bulb globe temperature. By directly measuring pilots' condition in the cockpit, the new system minimizes thermal stress and supports performance quality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Five {{protective}} garments (light summer clothing L, {{high visibility}} clothing HV, military clothing MIL, climber coverall CLM and firefighting clothing FIRE) were assessed on eight unacclimated male subjects at two environments: moderate warm environment with high humidity (MWH, 20. 0 °C, 86 % relative humidity) and warm environment with moderate humidity (WMH, 30. 0 °C, 47 % relative humidity). The thermophysiological responses and subjective sensations were reported. The PHS model (ISO 7933) was used for predicting thermophysiological responses for each testing scenario. It was {{found that there were}} significant differences between clothing FIRE and other clothing on thermal sensation (p< 0. 05). Significant differences were found on skin humidity sensation between FIRE and L, HV or MIL (p< 0. 001). The RPE value in FIRE is significantly different with L and HV (p< 0. 05). In MWH, the post-exercise <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> increased by 0. 59 and 1. 29 °C in MIL and CLM. In contrast, <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> in L, HV, MIL, CLM and FIRE in WMH increased by 1. 7, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2. 8 and 3. 3 °C, respectively. The PHS model presented good performance on predicted <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> in MIL and CLM at the two studied environments. However, the <b>skin</b> <b>temperature</b> prediction with light clothing in WMH was weak. For thick protective clothing, the prediction on rectal temperature was protective.

The clothing model simulated heat and moisture transfer from the human skin to the environment through the microenvironment and fabric. In this clothing model, the air gap between skin and clothing, as well as clothing properties such as thickness, thermal conductivity, density, porosity, and tortuosity were taken into consideration.

30|$|Heat {{dissipation}} {{and heat}} production from exercise play {{important roles in}} the human skin temperature change. When the exercise intensity increases, the metabolic rate increases too. So more heat is produced via human body. Perspiration evaporation is {{an efficient way to}} take out the body heat, thus adjust human body surface temperature. But which one is more important depends both on exercise intensity and environment conditions. Compared the <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature</b> on the first stage of 3 exercise at 26  °C on Fig.  7, skin temperature of Exercise 3 is higher than Exercise 1, which means heat production of 6  km/h is much more than heat dissipation. But for Exercise 2, the skin temperature is lower than Exercise 1, which means more heat dissipate than produced. In this case, exercise intensity has a greater influence on <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature</b> of Exercise 2 and 3 at 31  °C shows the opposite results, which indicates that environmental condition has obvious effect on the heat dissipation.|$|E

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis were to assess whether obese {{relative}} to non-obese individuals have blunted metabolic and non-shivering thermogenic responses in acute mild cold exposure, possibly established by a higher capacity to activate brown adipose tissue in the non-obese, resulting in greater energy expenditure. It was hypothesised that the obese would demonstrate a reduced non-shivering thermogenesis during acute mild cold exposure despite having lower <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the same core temperature. The first study resulted in obese individuals having lower mean rate of oxygen consumption (p < 0. 05), lower <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> (p < 0. 05), and lower mean heat flux (p < 0. 05) during a 19 °C exposure. There was no difference, however, in carbohydrate (p = 0. 14) or lipid (p = 0. 46) oxidation rates. The second study resulted in obese having lower <b>mean</b> supraclavicular <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> (p < 0. 001), lower mean supraclavicular heat flux (p < 0. 05), lower mean surface temperatures from FLIR thermography (p < 0. 05) and a lower mean metabolic response (p < 0. 05). Non- shivering thermogenesis was achieved as there was minimal and no significantly different skeletal muscle activity {{between the two groups}} (p = 0. 94). In conclusion, during acute mild cold exposure, obese individuals displayed a significantly lower non- shivering thermogenesis despite having lower <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the same core temperatures relative to non-obese individuals.

This investigation focuses on re-specifying the parameters in Fanger's model, the majority of which are empirically-derived coefficients, to improve its thermal comfort predictions for naturally ventilated spaces. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the comfort temperature prediction is by far most sensitive to the comfort value of <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature.</b> Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis also indicated that for the Fanger model to produce better comfort temperature predictions for naturally ventilated buildings, the comfort <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature</b> needs to be correlated to an outdoor climate variable, thereby accounting for the psychological adaptations of occupants of naturally ventilated buildings that were largely ignored in the original climate chamber derivation of this parameter. A modified comfort <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperature,</b> that is a function of both metabolic rate and outdoor effective temperature and is applicable to naturally ventilated environments only, produces comfort temperature predictions that agree well with field study data. The thermal sensation transfer coefficient was also updated based on a weighted multiple linear regression of field study data.

40|$|The {{effects of}} bed rest and {{exercise}} training during bed rest on body temperature and thermoregulatory responses at rest and during exercise are investigated. Seven male subjects underwent three two-week periods of bed rest during which isometric, isotonic, or no exercises were performed, separated by two ambulatory control periods and {{preceded by a}} two-week control period, during which they exercised regularly. Rectal and <b>mean</b> <b>skin</b> <b>temperatures</b> and sweating responses were determined during 70 -min submaximal supine exercise during the bed rest and recovery periods. Measurements reveal a reduction in basal oral temperature during the control-recovery periods, with a relatively constant level during bed rest periods, and {{a significant increase in}} the rectal temperature elavation brought on by exercise following all three bed-rest regimes. It is concluded that the excessive increase in rectal temperature could be influenced by changes in skin heat conductance or the inhibition of sweating...|$|R
