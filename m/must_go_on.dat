5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante <b>must</b> <b>go.</b> <b>On</b> June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the minor-league Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Brigade {{embarked}} for the Western Front on 17 June 1916. Its first {{battle was}} the disastrous Battle of Fromelles. Despite his inexperience in trench warfare, {{he pointed out}} to Major H. C. L. Howard of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's British Expeditionary Force staff that the width of no-man's land was too great for the assault to succeed. Major Howard agreed and, on returning to Haig's Chateau, attempted to persuade him that the attack was doomed to fail. But the commander-in-chief decided that the operation <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> so Elliott did all that was possible {{to make it a}} success by himself going to the front line to personally inspect the lie of the land and encourage his men. He soon realised that the attack had been a complete failure, reported to that effect, and established that he was now organising the defence of the original trenches. In the end, 1,804 of the 5,533 Australian casualties were from the 15th Brigade. For his part, Elliott was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Russian Order of St Anna (3rd class, with swords).|$|E
5|$|Draupadi is {{the heroine}} of Mahabharata. She is common {{wife of the}} five Pandava {{brothers}} and queen of Hastinapur, in their reign. Born from a fire-sacrifice of king of Panchala - Drupada, Draupadi was prophesied {{to lead to the}} end of Drona and Kauravas. Though the middle Pandava Arjuna - disguised as a brahmin - wins her in her swayamvara, Draupadi is compelled to marry all the five brothers on command of her mother-in-law Kunti. Pandavas agree to the plan that Draupadi will always be the chief consort of all brothers and always the empress. She will be in personal union with one brother every year and may bear him a child. Anyone of the other 4, who interrupts them during a private time within that one year, <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a 11-month prilgrimage. She insults Kaurava general Karna in the swayamvara and laughs at Duryodhana - the leader of Kauravas - when he falls in her Pandava palace at Indraprastha. She mothers five sons from each of the Pandavas, regaining her virginity after every year. The Kauravas take their revenge when the eldest Pandava Yudhishthira loses her to Kauravas in a game of dice. Kaurava Dushasana tries to disrobe her in the royal court, however divine intervention saves her dignity by making her wrapped cloth infinite in length. Draupadi pledges to keep her hair untied till they were drenched by Dushasana's blood and mocks her husbands and all present in the court. Pandavas and Draupadi finally accept 13-year exile for losing the game. While in exile in the forest, her second husband Bhima rescued her from various demons and Jayadratha, who abducted her. She also instructed Krishna's queen Satyabhama on the duties of a wife. In the 13th year of exile, Draupadi and her husbands spent life incognito in Virata's court. She served as the maid of the queen and is harassed by the queen's brother Kichaka, who she desires to be killed by Bhima. After life in exile, a war breaks between the Kauravas and Pandavas, in which the Kauravas are slain and her insult avenged, but Draupadi also loses her father, brothers and sons. Yudhishthira became the emperor of Hastinapur with Draupadi as the chief consort. At the end of their lives, Draupadi and her husbands set off to the Himalayas to walk to heaven; but Draupadi falls in the middle as she loved Arjuna more than her other husbands. She is venerated as a village goddess and described at times an avatar of the fierce goddess Kali or the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi.|$|E

25|$|With the Nivelle Offensive in {{its final}} stages, Lloyd George went to the Paris Summit {{authorised}} by the 1 May 1917 War Cabinet to “press the French to continue the offensive”. Lloyd George was keen to build bridges with the generals and told them at Paris (3 May 1917) that he would back their plans (“We <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> hitting and hitting with all our strength”) and stressed that they must choose {{the time and place}} of the next offensive. The next day Robertson stressed attrition with limited territorial objectives, whilst Hankey stressed the importance of Zeebrugge, where the Germans would suffer attrition if they stood and fought. Over dinner the Prime Minister reduced the company to “fits of laughter” with an impersonation of Robertson. Robertson thought Paris “about the best Conference we have had”. With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
500|$|John Kinnaird {{also paid}} {{particular}} attention to Hazlitt's [...] "celebrated" [...] sketch of Prince Hamlet in this essay. Although Hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure [...] "character" [...] critics, this essay does {{tend to be more}} of a [...] "character" [...] criticism than others, asserts Kinnaird, because Hazlitt shared with his Romantic contemporaries an [...] "ambivalence toward tragedy". Hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was [...] "obsessed with evil in the world [...] long to escape from knowledge of it in themselves [...] pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that the world <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> as it is." [...] Thus, Hazlitt could declare, [...] "It is we who are Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kazon have {{received}} a negative response from television critics. In his 2005 book An Analytical Guide to Television's Battlestar Gallactica, literary critic John Kenneth Muir argued that the events of Star Trek: Voyager lost their urgency with the basing of the second season in Kazon space. He negatively compared Star Trek: Voyager to science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica, writing that Star Trek: Voyager could learn from how [...] "the Galactica <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> ever forward, to their destination". The alien species was described as [...] "stereotypical macho space warriors" [...] by writer K. Stoddard Hayes, who was critical {{of the lack of}} developed Kazon characters. [...] He explained this up by saying: [...] "No memorable Kazon characters emerge from two seasons of episodes featuring their different factions." ...|$|E
60|$|Doubtless {{the reader}} already {{foresees}} {{the course of}} our argument. This multiplication of effects, which is displayed in every event of to-day, has been going on from the beginning; and is true of the grandest phenomena of the universe as of the most insignificant. From the law that every active force produces more than one change, it is an inevitable corollary that during the past there has been an ever-growing complication of things. Throughout creation there <b>must</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>on,</b> and <b>must</b> still <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> a never-ceasing transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous.

500|$|Welsh singer Shirley Bassey {{included}} {{a cover of}} the song on her 1996 album The Show <b>Must</b> <b>Go</b> <b>On.</b> Scottish singer Susan Boyle also covered the song for her debut album, I Dreamed a Dream (2009). Reportedly, Boyle loved the song for years, and used to sing the ballad at auditions when she was cruelly turned away. At {{the end of the}} number Boyle, sometimes [...] "reduced to tears", would assert [...] "You'll see". Reviewing the album for the New York Daily News, Jim Farber felt that Boyle's voice sounded [...] "remote and idealized" [...] on the album, until [...] "You'll See", where the characteristic [...] "anger and vengeance" [...] in her vocals [...] "give her a harder character to chew on". The cover was included on the first episode of Brazilian telenovela Ti Ti Ti (2010). When Boyle started working on the musical I Dreamed a Dream which was based on her life, she had asked Madonna's permission to use the song onstage, but Madonna denied usage of the track.|$|E
