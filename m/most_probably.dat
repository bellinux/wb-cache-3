5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest {{that he might be}} Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} abbey began to lease out its land (<b>most</b> <b>probably</b> as a {{solution}} to their falling income). By 1477 only the demesne lands in Leicester, Stoughton and Ingarsby remained un-leased, and were directly farmed by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} Vlad Dracul's burial {{has not been}} identified. Cazacu says, he was <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> buried in the Monastery of Snagov. Florescu writes, Vlad Dracul was buried in a chapel in the Dealu Monastery near Târgoviște.|$|E

5000|$|Møsting's House {{dates from}} a time when Frederiksberg {{was the most popular}} place for wealthy Copenhageners to build their summer residences. The house was {{originally}} located at the corner of Smallegade and Falkoner Allé. It was built for Johan Sigismund von <b>Møsting,</b> <b>probably</b> to a design by one of Caspar Frederik Harsdorff's students. Møsting succeeded Ernst von Schimmelmann in 1813 and was from 1814 {{he was a member of}} Gehejmestatsrådet.|$|R
50|$|While PMD {{does not}} officially stand for anything, it has several {{unofficial}} names, the <b>most</b> appropriate <b>probably</b> being Programming Mistake Detector.|$|R
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{modernization}} program was announced. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems {{was chosen to}} provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization, and <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> the L7A2 105 mm cannon will be replaced with a more powerful 120mm cannon, like the L44 120 mm Cannon. The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the Baths of Zeuxippus were also close (<b>most</b> <b>probably</b> adjacent) to the Great Palace grounds. This evidences their popularity, {{as such a}} location would have attracted many people, being in such great proximity to such significant places. The square of the Augustaeum and the basilica of Hagia Sophia were also close to the Baths.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the ARBiH and the HVO coordinated before their advance to Kupres. <b>Most</b> <b>probably,</b> the two forces' {{commands}} agreed on a simultaneous offensive against Kupres, without revealing actual battle plans to their counterparts. The HVO's contribution in the offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar, was planned jointly by the HVO and the HV.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} earthworks comprising a ditch and rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. There is evidence to show that {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} this we can observe {{major changes in}} the {{aggregate}} EPL index developed by the OECD and available until 2013. Here, it has to be noted that some of the <b>most</b> recent and <b>probably</b> <b>most</b> substantial reforms have not yet been incorporated.|$|R

The large Calvatia species are special, because one or two at the <b>most</b> will <b>probably</b> be sufficient for a dinner for two. While this puffball does not have a strong flavor of its own, it is still quite good, and its ability to absorb flavors makes it a rewarding find." ...|$|R
5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those {{who survived the}} double attack left the Pontic steppes and crossed the Carpathians {{in search of a}} new homeland. The memory of the destruction brought by the Pechenegs seems to have been preserved by the Hungarians. The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{abandoned}} their fortified camp on Mount Bábolna, <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> because they needed new provisions. They moved towards Dés, pillaging the noblemen's manors during their march. They threatened all {{who did not}} support them with severe punishments. They established a new camp on the Szamos (Someș) River near the town. A new battle was fought between the rebels and their enemies near the camp in late September.|$|E
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E

5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, <b>most</b> <b>probably,</b> by his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, Luisa Miller, for a production in Naples later in the year.|$|E
5|$|When Gümüshtekin, {{governor}} of Aleppo, {{one of the}} last independent Muslim rulers in Syria after Saladin, had conquered almost all neighboring states, he released Raynald, along with Joscelin of Courtenay and all other Christians prisoners in 1176. Raynald's ransom, fixed at 120,000 gold dinars, reflected his prestige. It was <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> paid by ManuelI Komnenos, according to Barber and Bernard Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Bruno Andreas Liljefors (14 May 1860 - 18 December 1939) was a Swedish artist, the <b>most</b> {{important}} and <b>probably</b> <b>most</b> influential wildlife painter {{of the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century. He also drew some sequential picture stories, making him one of the early Swedish comic creators. He was brother of the composer and conductor Ruben Liljefors.|$|R

5|$|Andrew was the {{youngest}} of the four sons of András Báthory and Margit Majláth. His father was the marshal of the court of Isabella Jagiellon and her son, John Sigismund Zápolya. Isabella and John Sigismund ruled the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The date of Andrew's birth is uncertain, because his actual age was kept secret in the early 1580s to promote his career in the Roman Catholic Church. He was <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> born in late 1562 or early 1563, according to historian Ildikó Horn. His father died around that time, implying that Andrew was a posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E
5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, <b>most</b> <b>probably</b> having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E
50|$|Ishtarat was a Semitic deity worshipped in {{the city}} of Mari, Syria. Its temple was found in 1952 and the goddess was <b>most</b> a <b>probably</b> a variant of Ishtar, who was also worshipped beside Ishtarat in Mari.|$|R
