60|$|So {{confident}} {{were the}} Rebu {{that if the}} Egyptians dug through their walls, or even threw them down by undermining them, they could repel their assault, that they took but little heed to the huts established {{at the foot of}} the wall, except that a strong body of men were stationed behind the walls, half of whom were always to be under arms in readiness to repel the Egyptians should they burrow through. This confidence proved their ruin. The Egyptians were thoroughly accustomed to mining operations, and were fully aware that were they to pierce the wall the Rebu could at once overwhelm the small working parties; they, therefore, after penetrating a considerable distance into the embankment, drove right and left, <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> of considerable size, the roof being supported by beams and planks hauled up at night.|$|E
60|$|You have read, no doubt, {{of their}} discovering, {{a year or}} two since, in <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> in a Pompeian street, the molds of four human bodies, three women and a man, who fell down, blind and writhing, in the storm of fire {{eighteen}} hundred years ago; whose shape the settling and hardening ashes took; whose flesh wasted away, and whose bones lay there in the hollow of the matrix till the cunning of this time found them, and, pouring liquid plaster round the skeletons, clothed them with human form again, and drew them forth into the world once more. There are many things in Pompeii which bring back the gay life of the city, but nothing which so vividly reports the terrible manner of her death as these effigies of the creatures that actually shared it. The man in the last struggle has thrown himself upon his back and taken his doom sturdily--there is a sublime calm in his rigid figure. The women lie upon their faces, their limbs tossed and distorted, their drapery tangled and heaped about them, and in every fibre you see how hard they died. One presses her face into her handkerchief to draw one last breath unmixed with scalding steam; another's arms are wildly thrown abroad to clutch at help; another's hand is appealingly raised, and on her slight fingers you see the silver hoops with which her poor dead vanity adorned them.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a control}} {{approach}} called Artificial Neural Tissue (ANT) {{is applied to}} multirobot excavation for lunar base preparation tasks including clearing landing pads and burying of habitat modules. We show for the first time, a team of autonomous robots excavating a terrain to match a given 3 D blueprint. Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical shielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules under 0. 5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding and maintain temperatures of - 25 $^{o}$C. This minimizes base life-support complexity and reduces launch mass. ANT is compelling for a lunar mission because it doesn't require a team of astronauts for excavation and it requires minimal supervision. The robot teams are shown to autonomously interpret blueprints, excavate and prepare sites for a lunar base. Because little pre-programmed knowledge is provided, the controllers discover creative techniques. ANT evolves techniques such as slot-dozing that would otherwise require excavation experts. This is critical in <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> mission feasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers evolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters. These and other techniques such as concurrent evolution of the controller and team size are shown to tackle problem of antagonism, when too many robots interfere reducing the overall efficiency or worse, resulting in gridlock. While many challenges remain with this technology our work shows a compelling pathway for field testing this approach.

60|$|A man {{never knows}} what tiny thing will startle him to such ancestral and impersonal tears. Piles of superb masonry will often pass like a common panorama; {{and on this}} grey and silver morning the ruined towers of the cathedral stood about me {{somewhat}} vaguely like grey clouds. But down in a hollow where the local antiquaries are <b>making</b> <b>a</b> fruitful <b>excavation,</b> <b>a</b> magnificent old ruffian with a pickaxe (whom I believe to have been St. Joseph of Arimathea) showed me a fragment of the old vaulted roof which he had found in the earth; and on the whitish grey stone {{there was just a}} faint brush of gold. There seemed a piercing and swordlike pathos, an unexpected fragrance of all forgotten or desecrated things, in the bare survival of that poor little pigment upon the imperishable rock. To the strong shapes of the Roman and the Gothic I had grown accustomed; but that weak touch of colour was at once tawdry and tender, like some popular keepsake. Then I knew that all my fathers were men like me; for the columns and arches were grave, and told of the gravity of the builders; but here was one touch of their gaiety. I almost expected it to fade from the stone as I stared. It was as if men had been able to preserve a fragment of a sunset.|$|R
60|$|Another half-hour placed {{before us}} Bathurst in full view. The first salient {{point is the}} graveyard, where the station began and where the {{stationed}} end. Wags declare that the first question is, 'Have you seen our burial-ground?' A few tomb-stones, mostly without inscriptions, are scattered so near the shore that corpses and coffins have been washed away by the waves. If New Orleans be a normal 'wet grave,' this everywhere save near the sea is dry with a witness, the depth and looseness of the sand <b>making</b> the <b>excavation</b> <b>a</b> crumbling hole. Four governors, a list greatly to be prolonged, 'lie here interred.' But matters of climate are becoming too serious for over-attention to such places or subjects.|$|R
