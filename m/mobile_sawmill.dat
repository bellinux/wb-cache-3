40|$|Emergency relief project TCP/THA/ 0052 (E) {{addressed}} the disastrous situation after Typhoon "Gay" struck {{the south of}} Thailand in 1989. It was intended to rehabilitate land {{in the areas of}} Thae Sae and Pathiu districts of Chumporn province in southern Thailand and identify short-term cash income possibilities for farmers. It aimed at producing fast-growing trees for windbreaks and to promote sericulture. The project was able to buy seedlings for windbreak establishment; purchase spare parts for a <b>mobile</b> <b>sawmill,</b> and construction material for silkworm-rearing houses; train farmers, carpenters, sawmillers, forestry technicians; and train target beneficiaries in sericulture development. Given the interest shown by the farmers in fruit and other fast-growing trees for windbreaks, it is recommended that the Department of Agriculture Extension (DOAE) review the policy of fruit-tree propagation. Seedlings could be produced, even on a contractual basis, by small, low-cost village or private nurseries. The delegation of seedling production to the rural people themselves will create a consciousness for tree establishment that will contribute to rural income-generation and diversification. DOAE's role should be defined to monitor these small-scale nurseries and to train "nursery managers" in the propagation of fruit and forest trees. The nurseries established under the project and those expected to be built in Chumporn province by the DOAE provincial office, could be utilized both for delegated seedling production and as training facilities for private or communal nursery enterprises. Large-scale use of Acacia mangium for the establishment of windbreaks should only be attempted after further work on the selection of the most suitable provenance has been carried out. In this regard the Government may wish to contact CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), Division of the Institute of Plant Production and Processing in Australia, taking advantage of existing contacts with CSIRO and RFD. Windbreaks should not be confined to one row of uniform trees. A horizontal multi-layered, wide belt, consisting of a mixture of species is much more effective and minimizes the risk of total loss of wind protection through disease or natural disasters...|$|E
40|$|The Authors {{tested a}} <b>mobile</b> small-log <b>sawmill</b> {{system that could}} produce cants and boards of {{variable}} size, according {{to the needs and}} specifications of each property owner. The unit was deployed as part of a comprehensive mechanical fuel reduction operation, aimed at thinning small properties around homesteads. Working on conifer small logs, the mill proved very efficient, with a processing productivity between 0. 3 and 2. 8 m 3 of lumber per working hour and a recovery rate of 50 % for boards, and 67 % for cants. The mill could be set up and dismantled in a few hours and was easy to move around. However, the exceedingly small amount of logs available at each site entailed a low utilization of the mill (about 25 % of the time) and a consequently high processing cost. Under the conditions of the study, milling cost can be contained below 150 US dollars per m 3 of lumber only if the single site offers at least 50 m 3 of logs, already sorted during harvesting. Hence the suggestion of pooling the wood obtained from small parcel fuel reduction treatments in satellite yards and milling it only when a large enough amount has been accumulated. In turn, satellite yards could be organized into an integrated network complementary-rather than alternative-to stationary mills. Â© 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R
