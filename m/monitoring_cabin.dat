40|$|Public {{means of}} {{transport}} have been the object of numerous terrorist attacks, {{mainly because of the}} high concentration of passengers, the criticality of mobility in modern society and the difficulties in applying effective screening or other protection measures. Video surveillance {{is one of the major}} instruments to increase security. However, in the case of managing emergencies following major accidents or security events, classical CCTV based surveillance is of little use, apart from forensic investigations. The main issues are related to: • The time and resources needed to process the huge amounts of information accumulated during the 24 / 7 CCTV operations. • The cost of maintaining such centralised infrastructures. • The threat (or perception of threat) to personal data and privacy from the continuous acquisition, transmission and storage of video streams. ASPIS is a novel smart surveillance system that was conceived soon after the London bombing events in order to answer the above issues. It is a scalable, modular, surveillance / alarm system designed to provide prompt, complete, pertinent information for the management of emergency situations in public {{means of transport}} without compromising citizen’s right to privacy. In fact, it records and transmits information only on the occurrence of an emergency event. Three operational scenarios have been developed and tested: 1. Underground metro / suburban rail: on-board surveillance, on-board explosion / gunshots 2. Ferry or cruise vessel: <b>monitoring</b> <b>cabin</b> occupancy under vessel evacuation conditions 3. Ferry or cruise vessel: monitoring doors / accesses to sensitive rooms / spaces The ASPIS project, financed from the EC under the FP 7 -SST scheme, started on June 2008 and concluded on March 2012. It has been coordinated by THALES Security Systems. A prototype system was tested in the Paris underground and on board of a large ferry vessel. JRC. E. 3 -Cyber and Digital Citizens' Securit...|$|E

40|$|To <b>monitor</b> <b>cabin</b> air quality, {{infectious}} disease transmission, and intentional airborne contaminant releases in commercial aircraft cabins, {{it is necessary}} to place contaminant sensors in the cabins. Such sensors are often expensive, heavy, and bulky so they cannot be deployed in large quantity. This study used a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program to study how limited amount of sensors should be placed in an airliner cabin. This investigation first validated the CFD program with the experimental data of an airborne contaminant simulated by a tracer gas, air velocity and air temperature distribution obtained from a mockup of a twin-aisle aircraft cabin. Then the validated CFD program was used to study contaminant transport in a nine-row section of a Boeing 767 aircraft cabin with airborne contaminants released under different scenarios. By assuming different contaminant release rates and sensor sensitivities, the optimal sensor location and number were determined. It was found that the best location for a sensor {{is in the middle of}} the ceiling. The sensor detection capability depended on the contaminant source release rate and time as well as the sensor sensitivity. To detect contaminant effectively, this study also proposed a multiple-point sampler for each row...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric Revitalization (AR) is {{the term}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) uses to {{encompass}} the engineered systems that maintain a safe, breathable gaseous atmosphere inside a habitable space cabin. An AR subsystem is {{a key part of}} the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) system for habitable space cabins. The ultimate goal for AR subsystem designers is to 'close the loop', that is, to capture gaseous human metabolic products, specifically water vapor (H 2 O) and Carbon dioxide (CO 2), for maximal Oxygen (o 2) recovery and to make other useful resources from these products. The AR subsystem also removes trace chemical contaminants from the cabin atmosphere to preserve cabin atmospheric quality, provides O 2 and may include instrumentation to <b>monitor</b> <b>cabin</b> atmospheric quality. Long duration crewed space exploration missions require advancements in AR process technologies in order to reduce power consumption and mass and to increase reliability compared to those used for shorter duration missions that are typically limited to Low Earth Orbit. For example, current AR subsystems include separate processors and process air flow loops for removing metabolic CO 2 and volatile organic tract contaminants (TCs). Physical adsorbents contained in fixed, packed beds are employed in these processors. Still, isolated pockets of high carbon dioxide have been suggested as a trigger for crew headaches and concern persists about future cabin ammonia (NH 3) levels as compared with historical flights. Developers are already focused on certain potential advancements. ECLS systems engineers envision improving the AR subsystem by combining the functions of TC control and CO 2 removal into a single regenerable process and moving toward structured sorbents - monoliths - instead of granular material. Monoliths present a lower pressure drop and eliminate particle attrition problems that result from bed containment. New materials and configurations offer promise for lowering cabin levels of CO 2 and NH 3 as well as reducing power requirements and increasing reliability. This chapter summarizes the challenges faced by ECLS system engineers in pursuing these goals, and the promising materials developments that may be part of the technical solution for challenges of crewed space exploration beyond LEO...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the airline}} industry, {{expected}} safety behaviours are being increasingly {{used to assess}} or observe flight crew non-technical skills (CRM) performance. While safety and human factors programs are well established components of cabin crew training, airlines are yet to identify the non-technical skills required of cabin crew to successfully manage safety critical tasks and situations. In addition, {{there is a lack}} of data on how cabin crew deal with threats and avoid, recover and manage error. This paper describes a two-part research project being undertaken within Qantas Airways. Phase 1 involved the application of the Critical Decision Method protocol to identify successful decision making skills amongst experienced cabin crew. From a qualitative analysis of interviews with eighty Customer Service Managers (CSMs), expected safety behaviours were identified, and grouped under the following seven elements: situational awareness, information & resource management, operational understanding, passenger management, crew management, negotiation & influencing skills, and workplace safety. The use of these expected safety behaviours in training and performance planning is discussed. Phase 2 of the project involves the proposed implementation of a LOSA-type program within the Cabin Crew environment, utilising the expected safety behaviours developed in Phase 1. The applicability of LOSA for cabin operations as well as the logistical and practical challenges of planning and implementing normal operations <b>monitoring</b> for <b>cabin</b> crew is discussed.

He digs into that place and opens the coffin. To his utmost surprise, he discovers a girl buried alive in the coffin. He takes the girl and admits her to the hospital. Inspector Anton Varghese (Siddharth Kher), the officer-in-charge of the case, tells the doctor {{to let him know}} as soon as she regains consciousness and asks one of his officers to stay alert in case the girl is attacked again. Interestingly, that very officer {{turns out to be a}} dishonest one and calls an anonymous person informing him of the girl being alive. He, then, secretly enters her cabin for a second attempt to kill her and this time too, by suffocation. He presses a pillow on her face but she manages to press the alarm button. This causes the nurse to rush to her cabin. The officer goes out of the cabin pretending to be unaware of the attack. Now, that the girl has become conscious, the doctor calls Inspector Anton.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} cabin environment is unique {{due to the}} proximity of the passengers, the need for cabin pressurization, and the low humidity. All of these aspects are {{complicated by the fact that}} the aircraft is a semi-enclosed structure. There is an increased desire to <b>monitor</b> the aircraft <b>cabin</b> environment with various sensors for comfort and safety. However, the {{aircraft cabin}} environment is composed of a large number of factors. Some of these factors can include air quality, temperature, level of pressurization, and motion of the aircraft. Therefore, many types of sensors must be used to monitor aircraft environments. A variety of technology options are often available for each sensor. Consequently, a fair number of tradeoffs need to be carefully considered when designing a sensor monitoring system for the aircraft cabin environment. For instance, a system designer may need to decide if the increased accuracy of a sensor using a particular technology is worth the increased power consumption over a similar sensor employing a more efficient, less accurate technology. In order to achieve a good solution, a designer needs to understand the tradeoffs and general operation for all of the different sensor technologies that could be used in the design. The purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of the current sensor technology.

The Thermal Desktop model includes an Air Revitalization System (ARS Loop), a Suit Loop, a Cabin Loop, and Pressure Control System (PCS) for supplying make-up gas (N 2 and O 2) to the Cabin and Suit Loop. The ARS and PCS are designed to maintain air quality at acceptable O 2, CO 2 and humidity levels as well as internal pressures in the vehicle Cabin and during suited operations. This effort required development of a suite of Thermal Desktop Orion ECLSS models to address the need for various simulation capabilities regarding ECLSS performance. An initial highly detailed model of the ARS Loop was developed in order to simulate rapid pressure transients (water hammer effects) within the ARS Loop caused by events such as cycling of the Pressurized Swing Adsorption (PSA) Beds and required high temporal resolution (small time steps) in the model during simulation. A second ECLSS model was developed to simulate events which occur over {{longer periods of time}} (over 30 minutes) where O 2, CO 2 and humidity levels, as well as internal pressures needed to be <b>monitored</b> in the <b>cabin</b> and for suited operations.
