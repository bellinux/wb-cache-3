40|$|Background Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{the first}} manifestation of allergic disease in early life. Early interventions may prevent the development of allergy disease. Allergy trace cards {{have been used to}} identify the level of allergic risk, based on family atopy scores. Because environmental factors may also influence the development of atopic dermatitis, the usefulness of the allergy trace card needs to be reevaluated. Objective To compare the incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants aged 0 - 4 months with total family atopy scores of > 0 to those with scores of 0. Methods We conducted this cohort study from June 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 at Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. Family atopy score was tabulated from all pregnant woman in the Obstetric Outpatient Clinic and the <b>Maternity</b> <b>Room.</b> Subjects were divided into two groups based on their total family atopy score: those with scores > 0 and those with scores of 0. The appearance of atopic dermatitis symptoms in the infants were evaluated until they reached 4 months of age. The incidence of atopic dermatitis in two groups was compared using Chi-square test. Results The incidence of atopic dermatitis in this study was 10. 9 %. The group with total family atopy scores of 0 had a significantly higher incidence of atopic dermatitis than the group with scores > 0 (adjusted RR 22. 5; 95 %CI 8. 8 to 57. 0; P = 0. 001). Conclusion The incidence of atopic dermatitis is higher in infants with total family atopy score > 0 and this group has a 22. 5 times higher risk of atopic dermatitis compared to infants with total family atopy score of 0.

This research aimed to applicate management of non-invasive pain on post partum mother through the approach of evidence based practice.

Data were collected at <b>maternity</b> <b>room,</b> dr. Soebandi Regional General Hospital. Using interview, observation, and physical examination. Data analysis was conducted through a descriptive analysis. Result: Through a careful nursing, it is found out that pain location and spreading that generally spotted at the patient 2 ̆ 7 s back during the contraction in the uterus, occurred around the shoulders when evidence-base practice is applied. The basic principle of applying an intervention to non invasive pain based on evidence–base practice are: cutaneous stimulation and distraction, while massaging area was set on the face, while the distraction media was interaction with the baby. Evaluation on evidence –based practice showed that pain is reduced to scale 2, while face and mobilitation become more relaxed. Discussion: Massage was intended to stimulated the production of endorphine and dinorphine that play an important roke to block the pain transmission through the descendent control system. Interaction with the baby was intended to function as a distraction media to dominate the incoming impuls into the ascendant control system,which further may close the gate of the pain transmitter. Both of the interventions were axpected to work synergically in reducing pain, since post-partum pain can be relieved more quickly when more than one technique are applied. Thus, to reduce post-partum pain, facial massage and interaction with the baby as non–invasive treatments are of important, respectively...|$|E

40|$|In Tanzania, {{maternal}} mortality ratio (MMR), unmet need for emergency obstetric care and health inequities {{across the country}} are in a critical state, particularly in rural areas. This study was established to determine the feasibility and impact of decentralizing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC) services in underserved rural areas using associate clinicians. Ten health centres (HCs) were upgraded by constructing and equipping <b>maternity</b> blocks, operating <b>rooms,</b> laboratories, staff houses and installing solar panels, standby generators and water supply systems. Twenty-three assistant medical officers (advanced level associate clinicians), and forty-four nurse-midwives and clinical officers (associate clinicians) were trained in CEmONC and anaesthesia respectively. CEmONC services were launched between 2009 and 2012. Monthly supportive supervision and clinical audits of adverse pregnancy outcomes were introduced in 2011 in these HCs and their respective district hospitals. After launching CEmONC services from 2009 to 2014 institutional deliveries increased in all upgraded rural HCs. Mean numbers of monthly deliveries increased by 151 % and obstetric referrals decreased from 9 % to 3 % (p = 0. 03) in HCs. A total of 43, 846 deliveries and 2, 890 caesarean sections (CS) were performed in these HCs making the mean proportion of all births in EmONC facilities of 128 % and mean population-based CS rate of 9 %. There were 190 maternal deaths and 1, 198 intrapartum and very early neonatal deaths (IVEND) in all health facilities. Generally, health centres had statistically significantly lower {{maternal mortality}} ratios and IVEND rates than district hospitals (p < 0. 00 and < 0. 02 respectively).
