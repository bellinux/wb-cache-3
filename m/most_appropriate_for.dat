25|$|Public Health {{surveillance}} {{systems can}} be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed {{in order to identify}} a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.|$|E
25|$|An Auror is an {{employee}} of the Ministry whose mission is to pursue and apprehend Dark wizards. According to Minerva McGonagall, the Auror Office takes in new recruits with a minimum of 5 N.E.W.T.s (with marks no lower than “Exceeds Expectations”). She suggests that Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology N.E.W.T.s are the <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> someone who aspires to be admitted to the training program. (A potential recruit will also have to pass “...a series of character and aptitude tests.”) Nymphadora Tonks mentions that two of the program’s courses of study are “Concealment and Disguise” and “Stealth and Tracking”, and that the training is hard to pass with high marks (a requirement).|$|E
25|$|Music may be {{provided}} by DJs, by live bands, or by music left to play unattended on a sound system, depending on the local scene's conventions {{and the nature of}} that particular event. DJs and bands may play a range of music from the 1920s to today, tending to concentrate on big band music from the 1930s and 1940s. Live bands play a wide variety of music for lindy hoppers, from big band standards and blues to original compositions. There are ongoing debates about the types of music <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> lindy hop and other swing dances, with the discussions focusing on whether the music should be historically accurate (i.e. matching a dance style with the popular music of the day) or include other musical styles and forms.|$|E

Typically, the tourniquet instrument allows the perioperative staff {{to set the}} tourniquet pressure, inflate or deflate the tourniquet cuff, and adjust safety settings such as the maximum allowed pressure and time limits. The digital display and control buttons give the surgical staff a straightforward method of monitoring the tourniquet pressure and time, and for changing the various tourniquet settings. Personalized tourniquet instruments have non-volatile memory to enable surgical staff to store specialized settings <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> certain surgeries (e.g. paediatric and hand surgery), relevant data about significant surgical events related to tourniquet usage, and to enable a data printout or transfer to an operating room information network. In addition, personalized tourniquet instruments use intuitive audio-visual alarms to alert the surgical staff of events related to patient safety.|$|E
25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E
