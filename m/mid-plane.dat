50|$|Streaming instabilities {{form when}} the solid {{particles}} are moderately coupled to the gas, with Stokes numbers of 0.01 - 3; the local solid to gas ratio is near or larger than 1; and the vertically integrated solid to gas ratio {{is a few}} times Solar. The Stokes number {{is a measure of}} the relative influences of inertia and gas drag on a particle's motion. In this context it is the product of the timescale for the exponential decay of a particle's velocity due to drag and the angular frequency of its orbit. Small particles like dust are strongly coupled and move with the gas, large bodies such as planetesimals are weakly coupled and orbit largely unaffected by the gas. Moderately coupled solids, sometimes referred to as pebbles, range from roughly cm- to m-sized at asteroid belt distances and from mm- to dm-sized beyond 10 AU. These objects orbit through the gas like planetesimals but are slowed due to the headwind and undergo significant radial drift. The moderately coupled solids that participate in streaming instabilities are those dynamically affected by changes in the motions of gas on scales similar to those of the Coriolis effect, allowing them to be captured by regions of high pressure in a rotating disk. Moderately coupled solids also retain influence on the motion of the gas. If the local solid to gas ratio is near or above 1, this influence is strong enough to reinforce regions of high pressure and to increase the orbital velocity of the gas and slow radial drift. Reaching and maintaining this local solid to gas at the <b>mid-plane</b> requires an average solid to gas ratio in a vertical cross section of the disk that is a few times solar. When the average solid to gas ratio is 0.01, roughly that estimated from measurements of the current Solar System, turbulence at the <b>mid-plane</b> generates a wavelike pattern that puffs up the <b>mid-plane</b> layer of solids. This reduces the solid to gas ratio at the <b>mid-plane</b> to less than 1, suppressing the formation of dense clumps. At higher average solid to gas ratios the mass of solids dampens this turbulence allowing a thin <b>mid-plane</b> layer to form. Stars with higher metallicities are more likely to reach the minimum solid to gas ratio making them favorable locations for planetesimal and planet formation.|$|E

The IRS spectrum {{is combined with}} ground-based 3 - 5 micron spectroscopy to obtain a complete inventory of solid state material present {{along the line of}} sight toward the source. We model the object with a 2 D axisymmetric (effectively 3 D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. It is found that the model disk, assuming a standard flaring structure, is too warm to contain the very large observed column density of pure CO ice, but is possibly responsible for up to 50 % of the water, CO 2 and minor ice species. In particular the 6. 85 micron band, tentatively due to NH 4 +, exhibits a prominent red wing, indicating a significant contribution from warm ice in the disk. It is argued that the pure CO ice is located in the dense core Oph-F in front of the source seen in the submillimeter imaging, with the CO gas in the core highly depleted. The model is used to predict which circumstances are most favourable for direct observations of ices in edge-on circumstellar disks. Ice bands will in general be deepest for inclinations similar to the disk opening angle, i. e. ~ 70 degrees. Due to the high optical depths of typical disk <b>mid-planes,</b> ice absorption bands will often probe warmer ice located in the upper layers of nearly edge-on disks. The ratios between different ice bands are found to vary by up to an order of magnitude depending on disk inclination due to radiative transfer effects caused by the 2 D structure of the disk. Ratios between ice bands of the same species can therefore be used to constrain the location of the ices in a circumstellar disk. [Abstract abridged...|$|R
40|$|Most star {{formation}} in the Galaxy takes place in clusters, where the most massive members can affect the properties of other constituent solar systems. This paper considers how clusters influence {{star formation}} and forming planetary systems through nuclear enrichment from supernova explosions, where massive stars deliver short-lived radioactive nuclei (SLRs) to their local environment. The decay of these nuclei leads to both heating and ionization, and thereby affects disk evolution, disk chemistry, and the accompanying process of planet formation. Nuclear enrichment can take place on two spatial scales: [1] Within the cluster itself (ℓ∼ 1 pc), the SLRs are delivered to the circumstellar disks associated with other cluster members. [2] On the next larger scale (ℓ∼ 2 - 10 pc), SLRs are injected into the background molecular cloud; these nuclei provide heating and ionization to nearby star-forming regions, and {{to the next generation}} of disks. For the first scenario, we construct the expected distributions of radioactive enrichment levels provided by embedded clusters. Clusters can account for the SLR mass fractions inferred for the early Solar Nebula, but typical SLR abundances are lower by a factor of ∼ 10. For the second scenario, we find that distributed enrichment of SLRs in molecular clouds leads to comparable abundances. For both the direct and distributed enrichment processes, the masses of ^ 26 Al and ^ 60 Fe delivered to individual circumstellar disks typically fall in the range 10 - 100 pM_ (where 1 pM_= 10 ^- 12 M_). The corresponding ionization rate due to SLRs typically falls in the range ζ_SLR∼ 1 - 5 × 10 ^- 19 sec^- 1. This ionization rate is smaller than that due to cosmic rays, ζ_CR∼ 10 ^- 17 sec^- 1, but will be important in regions where cosmic rays are attenuated (e. g., disk <b>mid-planes).</b> Comment: 52 pages, 13 figures, accepted to The Astrophysical Journa...|$|R

We decompose the axial surface brightness profiles of galaxies to model the central mass concentration - described by a Sérsic function - and the disc - described by a broken exponential disc.

In addition, the possibility of co-desorption in mixed and layered CO:N 2 ices is explored. The ice photodesorption is studied experimentally under ultra high vacuum conditions and at 15 - 60 K using a hydrogen discharge lamp (7 - 10. 5 eV). The ice desorption during irradiation is monitored by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry of the desorbed molecules. Both the UV photodesorption yields per incident photon and the photodesorption mechanisms are molecule specific. CO photodesorbs without dissociation from the surface layer of the ice. N 2, which lacks an electronic transition in this wavelength range, has a photodesorption yield {{that is more than}} an order of magnitude lower. This yield increases significantly due to co-desorption when N 2 is mixed in with or layered on top of CO ice. CO 2 photodesorbs through dissociation and subsequent recombination from the top 10 layers of the ice. At low temperatures (15 - 18 K) the derived photodesorption yields are 2. 7 x 10 ^- 3 and < 2 x 10 ^- 4 molecules photon- 1 for pure CO and N 2, respectively.

40|$|The {{development}} of efficient algorithms to understand implosion dynamics presents {{a number of}} challenges. The foremost challenge is to efficiently represent the coupled compressible fluid dynamics of internal air and surrounding water. Secondly, the method must allow one to accurately detect or follow the interface between the phases. Finally, it must be capable of resolving any shock waves which may be created in air or water during {{the final stage of}} the collapse. We present a fully Lagrangian compressible numerical framework for the simulation of underwater implosion. Both air and water are considered compressible and the equations for the Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics are stabilized via a variationally consistent multiscale method. A nodally perfect matched definition of the interface is used and then the kinetic variables, pressure and density, are duplicated at the interface level. An adaptive mesh generation procedure, which respects the interface connectivities, is applied to provide enough refinement at the interface level. This framework is then used to simulate the underwater implosion of a large cylindrical bubble, with a size in the order of cm. Rapid collapse and growth of the bubble occurred on very small spatial (0. 3 mm), and time (0. 1 ms) scales followed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the interface, in addition to the shock waves traveling in the fluid domains are among the phenomena that are observed in the simulation. We then extend our framework to model the underwater implosion of a cylindrical aluminum container considering a monolithic fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The aluminum cylinder, which separates the internal atmospheric-pressure air from the external high-pressure water, is modeled by a three node rotation-free shell element. The cylinder undergoes fast transient deformations, large enough to produce self-contact along it.
