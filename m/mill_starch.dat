40|$|Four {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} evaluated {{the effects of}} ruminal fluid inoculum:artificial saliva ratios, grinder type, grind size, and diet of ruminal fluid donor on in vitro starch disappearance. Experiment 1 examined rates of starch disappearance and coefficients of determination obtained by linear regression of starch disappearance using five grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolur (L.) Moench) lines, a corn (Zeu muys L.) control, and a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) control. Grains were incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h with inoculum varying in proportion of ruminal fluid and artificial saliva (l:l, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4). In vitro rates of starch disappearance and coefficients of determination were similar for the 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4 inoculum dilutions and were higher (quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than the 1 : 1 dilution. As the proportion of artificial saliva in the inoculum increased, in vitro pH increased (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 01). In Experiment 2, six grain sorghum lines and a corn control were ground through a l-mm screen in a Udy (cyclone type) or Wiley <b>mill.</b> <b>Starch</b> disappearance for samples ground using a Udy mill were higher (P 0. 10) by grain type fed; however, absolute rates of digestion varied among inoculate sources. Grinder, grind size, and ruminal fluid inoculum:artificial saliva ratios affected rate of starch disappearance in samples digested in vitro. Diet of ruminal fluid donor affected the rate of starch digestion, but not the relative ranking of the grains. If rates are to be compared across in vitro runs for different grains, these processing and dietary factors must be kept constant...|$|E
40|$|Commercial starch pearls {{manufactured}} from sago, tapioca, {{sweet potato}} or other starches from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore were characterized.

40|$|Four {{commercial}} starches, {{potato starch}} (PS), maize starch (MS), and two high amylose maize starches (HAMS), were cryo-milled, {{with and without}} hydration, for 20 min to study the effect of milling on physicochemical properties and enzyme digestibility. There was {{a significant increase in}} cold water soluble and damaged starch in cryo-milled samples in the order PS > MS > HAMS. Viscosity parameters of <b>milled</b> <b>starches</b> were significantly lower than for native starches, although changes in pasting temperature were not significant. In vitro digestion of native starches showed that enzyme resistance followed the order PS > HAMS > MS. A significant increase in enzyme digestion rate was observed after cryo-milling PS and HAMS but not MS. However, cryo-milled PS and HAMS were still less rapidly-digested than native MS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of native, <b>milled</b> and digested <b>starches</b> showed a uniform ‘inside-out’ digestion pattern for MS, whereas a heterogeneous and nonspecific pattern was observed for PS and HAMS. This study suggests that milling has predominantly mechanical rather than thermal effects on starches and that the relative enzyme resistance of PS and HAMS granules compared with MS is due to the absence of the structural features of MS granules that allow internal access of enzymes.

40|$|In recent decades, the {{expansion}} of alternative fuels production from crops traditionally used for food and animal feed has led to {{significant changes in the}} field of energy production, agriculture and food industry. Starch and sugar feedstocks for ethanol production (corn, wheat, sugar beet, sugar cane, etc.) require increasing arable land to meet market demands for the biofuel production. Although intensive studies are being carried out in order to identify improved and more cost-effective methods for the utilization of lignocellulosic and communal waste in the production of alcohol fuel, the possibility of using dry distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS), by-product of bioethanol production from corn and wheat as well as alcoholic beverages industry, is now in focus. Application of DDGS in livestock and poultry diets in concentrations greater than traditional could positively affect the economic viability of this biofuel production, but also stabilize the current imbalance in the food and animal feed market. However, DDGS feedstuff should not be treated as a perfect substitute for corn because the complexity of ration formulation determined at the farm or feedlot level is driven by energy and protein and other nutrient requirements, as well as their relative costs in the ration. Nevertheless, processing of corn by wet milling provides a multitude of co-products suitable for feedstuffs, food industry, pharmaceuticals, chemistry etc. Some of the most important wet milling co-products that have their use in feedstuffs are corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal. The use of DDGS as a substitute for traditional feed could prevent indirect land-use changes associated with biofuel production, and therefore preserve the environmental destruction by saving the forests and permanent pastures. The use of distiller’s grains can be beneficial to biofuel growth as this is an additional, the second largest, source of income accounting of 10 - 20 % total income. In this paper, the possibilities of by-products from corn grain bioethanol and alcoholic beverages production are represented. Emphasis is placed on the dry distillers' grains with solubles, which is the most abundant and for researchers currently the most attractive co-product of bioethanol industry. Co-products from wet <b>milling</b> <b>starch</b> and ethanol production have not yet been thoroughly investigated and therefore represent an interesting subject for further research...|$|R
