40|$|One {{hundred and}} one {{isolates}} of Enterococcus species isolated recently from hospitalized patients were evaluated in vitro for antibiotic susceptibility. Teicoplanin and <b>mideplanin</b> {{were the most}} active agents, followed by ramoplanin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and imipenem. High-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC > 500 micrograms/ml) and/or streptomycin (MIC > 2, 000 micrograms/ml) was found in 60 isolates. High-level resistance to ampicillin (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml) was found in 17 isolates. MBC studies revealed that ramoplanin possesses significant bactericidal activity...|$|E
40|$|MDL 63, 246 is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring glycopeptide antibiotic MDL 62, 476 (A 40926). It was {{more active in}} vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci than MDL 62, 476, teicoplanin, and vancomycin and was more active than <b>mideplanin</b> (MDL 62, 873) against some isolates. MDL 63, 246 had excellent activity against streptococci and teicoplanin-susceptible enterococci, and it also had in vitro activity against some VanA enterococcal isolates. It was more active than teicoplanin and vancomycin against acute staphylococcal, streptococcal, and enterococcal septicemia in immunocompetent and neutropenic mice. It was highly efficacious in reducing the bacterial load {{in the hearts of}} rats in staphylococcal endocarditis experiments and the bacterial load of Staphylococcus epidermis in a high infection model in neutropenic mice. The excellent in vivo activity of MDL 63, 246 appears to correlate both with its in vitro antibacterial activity and with its long half-life in rodents...|$|E
40|$|Glycopeptide antibiotics, such as {{vancomycin}} and teicoplanin, {{are used}} to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. They inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala C-terminus of peptidoglycan precursors. Vancomycin-resistant bacteria replace the dipeptide with the D-Ala-D-Lac depsipeptide, thus reducing the binding affinity of the antibiotics with their molecular targets. Herein, studies of the interaction of teicoplanin, teicoplanin-like A 40926, and of their semisynthetic derivatives (<b>mideplanin,</b> MDL 63, 246, dalbavancin) with peptide analogues of cell-wall precursors by NMR spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are reported. NMR spectroscopy revealed the existence of two different complexes in solution, when the different glycopeptides interact with Ac 2 KdAlaDAlaOH. Despite the NMR experimental conditions, which {{are different from those}} employed for the SPR measurements, the NMR spectroscopy results parallel those deduced in the chip with respect to the drastic binding difference existing between the D-Ala and the D-Lac terminating analogues, confirming that all these antibiotics share the same primary molecular mechanism of action and resistance. Kinetic analysis of the interaction between the glycopeptide antibiotics and immobilized AcKdAlaDAlaOH by SPR suggest a dimerization process that was not observed by NMR spectroscopy in DMSO solution. Moreover, in SPR, all glycopeptides with a hydrophobic acyl chain present stronger binding with a hydrophobic surface than vancomycin, indicating that additional interactions through the employed surface are involved. In conclusion, SPR provides a tool to differentiate between vancomycin and other glycopeptides, and the calculated binding affinities at the surface seem to be more relevant to in vitro antimicrobial activity than the estimations from NMR spectroscopy analysis...|$|E
