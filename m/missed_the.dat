5|$|The 2015 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Crusaders, who <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs {{for the first time}} since 2001.

Despite the poor record the Crusaders (46) had more points than the Stormers (45), but owing to the playoff structure <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. The Crusaders fare-welled Crusaders and All Black legends Richie McCaw and Dan Carter at the seasons end.|$|E

5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

While blocking a shot in the fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger.

In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, facilitated by the Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E
