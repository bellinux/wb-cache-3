40|$|KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED What are {{the best}} ways to {{organize}} payment systems to reward quality care for high-need, high-cost patients? What are the challenges to implementing such a payment system? KEY THEMES AND TAKEAWAYS This resource reviews emerging payer and provider partnerships that incentivize value-based payment models. Key points and recommendations include: The highest-need, highest-cost population is ever-changing. Payment systems should focus on identifying the population that will benefit most from care management services. Models must periodically re-evaluate this population. Provider incentives must be based on Triple Aim outcomes [...] better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower costs. If per-member-per-month incentive payments are used, there should be metrics that are evaluated to ensure that the Triple Aim is <b>met.</b> <b>Providers</b> face financial "barriers to entry" to make initial programmatic and infrastructure investments. Preventing inappropriate and/or avoidable use of care requires upfront investments such as information technology, social supports, and expansion of primary care services. Programs are most effective when they partner with patients, empowering them to {{take an active role in}} their own care management. A form of sustainable payment is a per-member-per-month care management fee based on Triple Aim outcomes for high-risk patients, plus shared savings. Providers with existing care management programs for high-need, high-cost patients prefer full-risk capitation payments...|$|E
40|$|As {{it stands}} STCW 2010 changes looks quite clear and in detail when {{reviewing}} the major changes introduced in June 2010. Examples of such clarity are in competence tables within STCW 2010 for marine engineering at operational and management. It is commonly accepted by MET organisations that applying the IMO model courses as programmes (Deck and Engineering) of MET for seafaring officers or as guidelines in their institution are sensible and a safe option {{of ensuring that}} their MET programmes {{are in line with}} IMO requirements/standards. The problem is that IMO model courses) for all ranks and types of ship officers) are not ready as yet. IMO declared in the recent STW 43 committee meeting in London that the model courses will be available soon. Since they are not ready, at the time this paper is being written, what this implies is that all MET institutions have to interpret the changes as best as they can. Many <b>MET</b> <b>providers</b> are of the view that has the resources to correctly implement the changes and integrate them within the MET Programmes. For institutions with fewer resources, lack of access to the latest IMO model courses has created some uncertainty, and this in term has and will lead to variability in th...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the weakest link in Maritime Education and Training (MET) is the {{identification}} of the communication problems due to lack of standards for Maritime English. Communication failures have caused many accidents and incidents in the past. There have been many attempts to reduce communication failures and improve both the content and delivery of Maritime English. A recent EU Leonardo Project MarEng considered a great success in enhancing the current efforts in improving content and delivery of English Courses by <b>MET</b> <b>providers.</b> However, there are no international or European standards yet for the evaluation, assessment and testing in Maritime English to measure students ’ competence and performance in this very important subject. To address this deficiency, MarEdu (TUDEV–CFF Partnership) with support from several EU member states as well as Norway instigated a major Leonardo Project known as MarTEL (Maritime Test of English Language) in 2007. The first phase of the project is near completion and final report to EU is expected in October 2009. MarTEL {{is expected to be a}} unique solution to improving the Maritime English competency of seafarers. MarTEL solution contains a series of study units supplemented by a set of tests in Maritime English. Pilot studies on MarTEL have shown to motivate cadets to learn English as MarTEL study units encourage learning English in the context of the maritime profession. This new and standardized method of delivery and assessment of Maritime English competency is expected to reduce the extremely high percentage number of accidents and incidents at sea and in ports, and save many lives...|$|E

To receive such payments, providers must meet both (1) eligibility requirements that specify the types of providers eligible to participate in the programs and (2) reporting requirements that specify the information providers must report to CMS or the states, including measures that demonstrate meaningful use of an EHR system and measures of clinical quality. For the Medicare EHR program, CMS has implemented prepayment processes to verify whether <b>providers</b> have <b>met</b> all of the eligibility requirements and one of the reporting requirements. Beginning in 2012, the agency also has plans to implement a risk-based audit strategy to verify on a postpayment basis that a sample of <b>providers</b> <b>met</b> the remaining reporting requirements. For the Medicaid EHR Program, the four states GAO reviewed have implemented primarily prepayment processes to verify whether <b>providers</b> <b>met</b> all eligibility requirements. To verify the reporting requirement, all four states implemented prepayment processes, postpayment processes, or both. CMS officials stated that the agency intends to evaluate how effectively its Medicare EHR program audit strategy reduces the risk of improper EHR incentive payments, though the agency has not yet established corresponding timelines for doing this work. Such an evaluation could help CMS determine whether it should revise its verification processes by, for example, implementing additional prepayment processes, which GAO has shown may reduce the risk of improper payments. In addition, CMS has opportunities to improve the efficiency of verification processes by, for example, collecting certain data on states behalf. ...|$|R

Most larger jails provide some level of mental health care such as suicide screening and psychopharmacological treatment, but services such as psychotherapy, counseling, and behavioral treatment are less frequently available. This article outlines a systems approach employed at one large jail that used managed care methods to contain costs while delivering a high quality of mental health care. Managed care strategies utilized include medication formularies, medical necessity and level-of-care guidelines, preauthorization, provider profiling, treatment algo-rithms, and case management for challenging inmates.

The obligation to compensate may represent a significant risk for the service provider, if the SLA is repeatedly violated. In this paper we evaluate {{the probability that a}} SLA commitment on the service availability is violated, when the service restoration time follows an exponential, Weibull, or lognormal distribution. For a two state model, where the service alternates between availability and unavailability periods, we show that such probability decreases as the variance of the restoration time grows, and that lengthening the time interval over which the service availability is evaluated reduces the risk for the service provider just if the compensation grows quite less than the length of that time interval.

Purchasers of health care are already responsible for assessing health needs and evaluating services, and the process of monitoring equity is a logical extension of these activities. Routine data sources used to collect activity data in both primary and secondary care can be used to assess needs for care and monitor how well these needs are <b>met.</b> Purchasers and <b>providers</b> should collaborate to improve the usefulness of these routine data and to develop a framework for monitoring and promoting equity more systematically...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In some cases, Medicare pays significantly more for covered outpatient drugs than the actual costs to the physicians and pharmacy suppliers. Attempts to reduce these payments have been <b>met</b> with <b>provider</b> claims that overpayments for the drugs are needed to cover underpayments for administering or delivering them. Medicare's method for establishing drug payments is flawed. Medicare pays 95 percent of the average wholesale price (AWP), which, despite its name, is neither an average nor a price that wholesalers charge. Instead, it is a number that manufacturers derive using their own criteria. There are no requirements or conventions that AWP reflect the price of actual drug sales. Widely available purchase prices for drugs in 2001 were substantially below AWP. For both physician-billed drugs and pharmacy supplier-billed drugs, Medicare payments often far exceeded widely available prices. Physicians and pharmacy suppliers contend that the excess payments for covered drugs are necessary to offset what they claim are inappropriately low Medicare payments or no such payments for services related to the administration or delivery of these drugs. Although physicians receive an explicit payment for administering drugs, Medicare's payment policies for delivering pharmacy supplier-billed drugs and related equipment are uneven. Pharmacy suppliers billing Medicare receive a dispensing fee for one drug type [...] inhalation therapy drugs [...] but not for other covered drugs, such as infusion therapy or covered oral drugs. Other payers and purchasers, such as private health plans and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), use different approaches to pay for or buy drugs that may be instructive for Medicare. In particular, VA uses the leverage from the volume of federal drug purchases to secure verifiable data on actual market transactions, and it uses the prices paid by manufacturers' best customers to set Federal Supply Schedule prices. ...|$|R

The New Zealand-Pacific Remittance Project, for example, was a collaboration between key organizations in New Zealand and abroad, conducted by the World Bank’s Pacific office (Abel and Hailwood 2012).

However, the project emphasized the views of the participating high-level organizations, with little input from the end users—the migrant senders—or consideration for aspects other than fees that may strengthen remittances for DRM. Yet, integrating the viewpoints of the migrants who send remittances is critical to designing policies that appropriately support DRM.|$|R

In 2006, Pallium India assembled a working group {{at the national level}} to develop minimum standards. The standards were to be evaluated by palliative care services in the country. Materials and Methods: The working group prepared a "standards" document, which had two parts - the first composed of eight "essential" components and the second, 22 "desirable" components. The working group sent the document to 86 hospice and palliative care providers nationwide, requesting them to self-evaluate their palliative care services based on the standards document, on a modified Likert scale. Results: Forty-nine (57 %) palliative care organizations responded, and their self-evaluation of services based on the standards tool was analyzed. The majority of the palliative care <b>providers</b> <b>met</b> most of the standards identified as essential by the working group.

This article presents a case study on the perceptions held by a teacher and his students {{on the use of}} E-textbooks in a primary education classroom.

In the analysis of the data generated, the classroom is considered a multimodal learning space, where virtual, physical and cognitive environments overlap, allowing students to negotiate meaning across multiple contexts and reflect upon it. Results show that e-textbook users’ perceptions greatly depend on the institutional culture in which they are embedded. While the adoption of E-textbooks does not necessarily mean a transition from traditional textbooks to E-textbooks, students and teachers may develop a more demanding range of criteria which must be <b>met</b> by e-textbook <b>providers.</b> By doing this, e-books become a real alternative to free internet resources.

40|$|UK {{policy makers}} and {{practitioners}} have to address identity categories {{in a number of}} ways. Policy documents relating to the statutory sector, for example health and social care, have routinely included performance measurement indicators which address {{the extent to which the}} needs of different populations are <b>met</b> by service <b>providers.</b> The raft of equalities-related legislation which has been introduced over the past few years in the UK has driven this agenda, and statutory sector agencies have responded by developing complex mechanisms for assessing the impact of their activities on different social groups. This paper addresses a key debate within intersectionality studies, and scholarship in the field of sexuality and gender; the debate around categorisation and anti-categorisation. It does so via the prism of LGBT equalities initiatives in local government. Local government work forms a useful means of addressing this debate, because policy makers are forced to amalgamate individual members of their populations into groups, in order to develop group-based interventions. However, grouping people on the basis of particular social characteristics, such as sexuality, risks erasing the intersectional nature of their identities. We explore the ways in which policy makers grapple with the complexities of LGBT and heterosexual identities, in the context of broader social forces such as heterosexism, biphobia and transphobia, as well as the constraints of the current economic climate. The paper draws on empirical material from a large ESRC funded project...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{delivering}} {{quality health care}} at a lower overall cost through accountable care organizations (ACO) as described {{as part of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) has gained momentum among payers, providers, and the public. The concept includes developing an organization that provides incentives for quality care while lowering the overall cost of the care. If the goals are <b>met,</b> then both <b>providers</b> and payers would be able to share in the financial savings produced by the lower health care costs achieved while improving the quality of care delivered. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has further defined ACOs in the proposal rule released March 31, 2011, in the Medicare Shared Savings Program: Accountable Care Organizations. Medicare has projected that, over the first 3 years, there will be 75 - 150 ACOs developed, resulting in coverage of 1. 5 - 4. 0 million Medicare beneficiaries. This initial phase has been projected to save Medicare 510 - 800 million in health care costs [1, 2]. Regardless of whether or not this initial model of ACOs will have long-term validity, it is likely that components of the model will be included in future health care reform; therefore, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM 2 ̆ 6 R) providers will have to decide how they will respond to these future changes.
