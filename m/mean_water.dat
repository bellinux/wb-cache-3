5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the <b>mean</b> <b>water</b> line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Doria {{produced}} moderate winds in New York City with gusts to 48mph (77km/h). The storm tide reached 3.8feet (1.2m) {{above normal}} at Battery Park, and rainfall peaked at 5.96inches (151mm). LaGuardia Airport recorded 2.29inches (58mm) {{of rain in}} a one-hour period. The threat of the storm cancelled a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets. Heavy rainfall flooded streets and subways in New York. In Connecticut, Doria produced up to 3.12inches (79mm) of rain and wind gusts peaking at 48mph (77km/h) in Hartford. Doria dropped light rain in Rhode Island, including a report of 0.97inches (25mm) in Providence. The storm also produced wind gusts of up to 61mph (98km/h) and a storm tide of 5.9feet (1.8m) above <b>mean</b> <b>water</b> level. In Boston, rainfall totaled to 0.83inches (21mm), while wind gusts peaked at 80mph (130km/h) at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory. Two people drowned in Marblehead when they were swept away by surf from the storm.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the determination of the}} precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860. This height survey was completely independent of the position survey, in contrast to modern GPS fixes which give both. The report of the levelling in Ireland had been published in 1855, and it fell to Clarke to prepare the reports for England and Scotland. For England this involved a least squares analysis for the 62 lines of primary levelling with 91 fundamental benchmarks at the end points and at points of intersection. The reference level was the height of <b>Mean</b> <b>Water</b> at Liverpool. 32 end points were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of <b>mean</b> <b>water</b> around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other trig point altitudes were measured by trigonometric levelling. The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.|$|E
25|$|In May 1964, the US {{government}} {{established the}} Miyakojima water supply agency, {{but it was}} abolished by the inhabitants. On July 1, 1965, a Miyakojima water supply and sewage organization was established Due {{to the increase in}} the demand of water, investigations on the situation of ground water were started in 1962. On July 15, 1965, Miyakojima ground water control regulations were determined; which were renewed on May 23, 1987. In 1973, there was a considerable drought in Miyakojima; leading to the investigation for new water sources. Projects for an underground dam and the conversion of Yonaha Bay into a fresh water lake were considered. The Yonaha Bay project met an opposition campaign in 1981 and was cancelled in 1983. The underground dam project continued and the Fukuzato underground dam and Sunakawa underground dam were completed in 1998. In 1993, rainfall dropped to two-thirds of the annual <b>mean.</b> <b>Water</b> restrictions continued from January 21 to April 1.|$|E

25|$|The railway {{line between}} Åby and Nyköping had been opened exactly five years before, on 1 October 1913. In {{conjunction}} {{with the construction of}} the stretch between Åby and Krokek, geological surveys had been carried out since an existing geological fault in the area posed a risk of the ground collapsing from underneath it down towards the shore of Bråviken Bay. The spring of 1918 had been dry, causing the <b>mean</b> <b>water</b> level of Bråviken to have dropped and the ground to have dried out, which in turn caused the ground to crack. September was, on the other hand, unusually rainy, enough so that the ground was saturated. The embankment was built on top of layers of clay, whose bearing capacity had been diminished due to the rains as the ground grew heavier. On 1 October 1918, the ground started to collapse when a layer of surge gravel started to slip against a layer of clay. The railway embankment collapsed, taking the road below with it. This caused the underlying layers to be pushed up, raising up the floor of the bay and causing a small peninsula to be formed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shutter-speed model {{analysis}} of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows estimation of <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (a measure of cellular energy metabolism) and volume transfer constant (a measure of hemodynamics). The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the prognostic utility of pretreatment <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant in predicting overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to stratify p 16 -positive patients based upon survival outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before treatment. Median, <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant values from metastatic nodes were computed from each patient. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to associate <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant and their combination with overall survival for the first 2 years, 5 years, and beyond (median duration, > 7 years). RESULTS: By the last date of observation, 18 patients had died, and median follow-up for surviving patients (n = 42) was 8. 32 years. Patients with high <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 01) prolonged overall survival by 5 years compared with those with low <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (13 deaths). Similarly, patients with high <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 006) longer overall survival at long-term duration than those with low <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (14 deaths). However, volume transfer constant was a significant predictor for only the 5 -year follow-up period. There was some evidence (P <. 10) to suggest that <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant were associated with overall survival for the first 2 years. Patients with high <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant were associated with significantly (P <. 01) longer overall survival compared with other groups for all follow-up periods. In addition, p 16 -positive patients with high <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant demonstrated a trend toward the longest overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combined {{analysis of}} <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant provided the best model to predict overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck...|$|R
