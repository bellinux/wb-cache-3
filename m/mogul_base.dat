50|$|The {{bulb socket}} {{in the center}} has a larger {{diameter}} (an E39 or E40 <b>mogul</b> <b>base)</b> than a regular E26 or E27 Edison screw light socket, and is typically made of cast porcelain for the higher temperatures. Mogul-base lamps are available for industrial use in larger power ratings (250-1500) and in halogen, mercury vapor, high-pressure sodium and Metal-halide lamp configurations. Compact fluorescent mogul-base bulbs are also available, as are adaptors to allow medium-base bulbs {{to be used in}} mogul sockets.|$|E

It {{turned out to be}} one of the biggest box-office hits of 1964.|$|R

25|$|In the {{business}} world, while Jewish Americans only constitute less than 2.5 {{percent of the}} U.S. population, they occupied 7.7 percent of board seats at various U.S. corporations. In New York real estate, 18 of the top 20 richest real estate <b>moguls</b> <b>based</b> in New York City are of Jewish extraction. American Jews also have a strong presence in NBA ownership. Of the 30 teams in the NBA, there are 14 Jewish principal owners. Several Jews have served as NBA commissioners including prior NBA commissioner David Stern and current commissioner Adam Silver.|$|R
50|$|MiND {{launched}} {{on the web}} on April 28, 2008. MiND {{launched on}} television on May 15, 2008, in the Philadelphia market. The first program shown on MiND TV was The Pepper Pot: Curry Chicken, produced by MiND's first member, Janet Davis. The first hour of MiND on television also included Fiddler: Overdubbing (featuring PA's 9-year old champion fiddler, Julia Voris), Quench (about Maasai women and their struggle to attain clean drinking water), Lubinville (biography of the first film <b>mogul,</b> <b>based</b> in Philadelphia), and Alix Olson: Pirates (spoken word performance about injustice, politics, and taking back the media).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a <b>mogul</b> screw <b>base</b> and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 Aba {{became the}} {{executive}} director of the charitable foundation that had recently been set up by William Stern, a property <b>mogul</b> and philanthropist <b>based</b> in London, and in this role he was responsible for the allocation of large amounts of charity funds to numerous Jewish causes across the world. He combined this with his work for Agudat Israel, until 1972, when he began working for Stern full-time, both in his charitable endeavours, and in his commercial endeavours. During the 1980s Aba began to work in West Africa, exporting consumer goods and industrial machinery to countries such as Nigeria, Gabon and Togo.|$|R
40|$|Manifold Ranking is a {{graph-based}} ranking algorithm be-ing successfully {{applied to}} retrieve images from multimedia databases. Given a query image, Manifold Ranking com-putes the ranking scores of {{images in the}} database by ex-ploiting the relationships among them expressed {{in the form of}} a graph. Since Manifold Ranking effectively utilizes the global structure of the graph, it is significantly better at finding intuitive results compared with current approaches. Fundamentally, Manifold Ranking requires an inverse ma-trix to compute ranking scores and so needs O(n 3) time, where n is the number of images. Manifold Ranking, un-fortunately, does not scale to support databases with large numbers of images. Our solution, <b>Mogul,</b> is <b>based</b> on two ideas: (1) It efficiently computes ranking scores by sparse matrices, and (2) It skips unnecessary score computations by estimating upper bounding scores. These two ideas re-duce the time complexity of Mogul to O(n) from O(n 3) of the inverse matrix approach. Experiments show that Mogul is much faster and gives significantly better retrieval quality than a state-of-the-art approximation approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|The 2 -hydroxy- 4, 6 -dimethoxyacetophenone was {{isolated}} from {{the leaves of the}} Peperomia glabella (Piperaceae family). The molecule crystallizes in the space group P 1 with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structural analysis reveals an infinite two-dimensional network in the (011) plane, stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds along [100] and van der Waals interactions along [011]. The molecules present strong intra-molecular hydrogen bonds [O 1 -HO 1 [...] . O 4 = 1. 53 (2) Å and O 5 -HO 5 [...] . O 8 = 1. 38 (2) Å]. The molecular conformation was analyzed using the <b>MOGUL,</b> a knowledge <b>base</b> of molecular geometry derived from the CSD (Cambridge Structural Database) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{company is}} {{preparing}} to go public on the NYSE. However, Lucious must contend with his ex-wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) upon her release from prison as she demands her piece of the company. He also struggles with Jamal's sexuality and Hakeem's inability {{to step up to}} the plate and show maturity as an artist. At the same time, Lucious neglects Andre seemingly due to his lack of musical ability. Lucious and Cookie's love for each other further complicates his existing relationship with his head of A&R, Anika Calhoun (Grace Gealey). The character of Lucious who starts out selling drugs as a teenager and develops into a well respected rapper and music <b>mogul</b> is loosely <b>based</b> on several real life figures from rappers, record producers, to politicians with a criminal past.|$|R
5000|$|Modules {{are only}} {{somewhat}} generic in structure; {{the rest is}} very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of working memory as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: {{it is part of}} the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory [...] "surface" [...] within the same store. In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from - and independent of - for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a <b>MOGUL</b> module (<b>based</b> on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see [...] "MOGUL architecture in a nutshell" [...] below).|$|R
