40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of EPC adoption has spurred {{not only the}} development of the RFID technology but also fostered the development of software that ensures functioning of the net ecosystem. This adds to importance of Object Code Mapping Service (OCMS). The existing approaches to OCMS implementation fail to provide for global scalability. This paper tackles the issue of direct and reverse search in an OCMS system. A problem of enabling <b>multipoint</b> <b>access</b> and global scalability is described.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of multiplexing techniques used in Microwave Photonics to Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems bring important advantages enabling the simultaneous and parallel delivery of multiple keys between a central station and different end-users {{in the context}} of <b>multipoint</b> <b>access</b> and metropolitan networks, or by providing higher key distribution rates in point to point links by suitably linking the parallel distributed keys. It also allows the coexistence of classical information and quantum key distribution channels over a single optical fibre infrastructure. Here we show, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, the successful operation of a two domain (subcarrier and wavelength division) multiplexed strong reference BB 84 quantum key distribution system. A four independent channel QKD system featuring 10 kb/s/channel over an 11 km link with Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) < 2 % is reported. These results open the way for multi-quantum key distribution over optical fiber networks. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The IEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} specifies the {{air interface}} of the fixed {{broadband wireless access}} (BWA) including the Media Access Control (MAC) layer supporting primarily Point to Multi Point PMP and optional MESH mode. The MAC is structured to support multiple physical specifications, each suits a different operational band. For 10 - 66 a direct line of sight is required between the BS and the Costumer Premises Equipment CPE with a single carrier. For the band lower than the 11 GHz, near line of sight or non line of sight is enough using three physical layer specifications: single carrier,OFDM, OFDMA. The MAC layer consists of three sublayers : the Convergence Sublayer {{which is responsible for}} mapping the different services to the specific MAC service data units (SDUs). The Common Part Sublayer is core of the MAC layer. It is responsible for packet scheduling according to the QoS requirements. The lowest sublayer is the Security Sublayer which is responsible for the key exchange and encryption. The standard revises are the IEEE 802. 16, IEEE 802. 16 a,IEEE 802. 16 c and IEEE 802. 16 d. This project simulates and evaluate IEEE 802. 16 a concentrating on the physical layer and the three MAC sublayers using the point to <b>multipoint</b> <b>access,</b> the OFDM mode which is suitable for the license exempt bands. The Encryption algorithm used is the double keys triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) with, EBC mode,FIPS 81. Assuming packet by packet processing, a 128 bytes packet needs 16 rounds of encryption using the same keys. MATLAB version 7 simulation was built {{for the sake of the}} performance analysis. All mandatory blocks in the IEEE 802. 16 a specification are included : Scheduler, Encryption, randomizer, Forward Error Correction (FEC) which includes Reed Solomon encoder, Convolutional Encoder, Interleaver and the Mapper, OFDM was simulated using 256 FFT. The channel was assumed to be Rican channel,the channel estimator. To enhance the BER, diversity technique with maximal ration combining is also simulated. The rate ID was chosen according to the SNR,and the number of packets that can be sent in one time slot are 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 packets as the rate ID increases. The so called the Unsolicited Grant Services are assigned a constant number of time slots. The scheduler chooses the connection having the highest priority function which is determined by the type of the connection and the ii state of the channel. If the satisfaction delay in the case of the real time services and the rate satisfaction in the case of the non real time services is not satisfied, the priority function is set to the maximum value. A desirable property of any encryption algorithm is that a small change in either the plain text or the key produces significant change in the cipher text. In particular, a change in one bit of the plain text or one bit in the key should produce a change in many bits of the cipher text. Avalanche effect test shows a change in a single bit produces difference in about half the ciphered block. The diversity results shows that the BER is enhanced dramatically by using the diversity technique. The BER is also increased as the Rate ID increases. However, when the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is used,the BER is set to the prescribed value 10 - 1. The results shows that CP also enhances the BER performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{improved}} performance in cellular radio networks led to the investigation of novel techniques able to cope for these needs. One of the most promising, currently evaluated {{in the framework of}} standardization bodies following ITU-R process for IMT-Advanced, is the so-called Coordinated <b>MultiPoint</b> (CoMP) <b>access</b> network architecture and related approaches and algorithms. CoMP {{is one of the most}} extensively studied topics in the context of Winner+ CELTIC European project. CoMP brings forward the concept of Advanced Antenna systems, introducing a degree of collaboration among a multiplicity of nodes exchanging information among them. Consequently, CoMP aims to exploit concurrently signals coming from all the nodes, transforming inter-cell interfering signals in useful ones, especially for cell-border users. In this paper some possible CoMP architectures are listed and the first results of simulations on CoMP systems, starting from ideal assumptions, are reported...|$|R
