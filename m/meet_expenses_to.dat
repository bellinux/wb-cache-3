50|$|The {{financial}} crunch due to {{the situations}} put C. V. Raman Pillai in a difficulty {{that he could not}} <b>meet</b> the <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> complete the printing of the remaining chapters as intended; so, he made a concise version and got it printed as part of twenty-sixth chapter, which thus became the final chapter of the novel. P. K. Parameswaran Nair states that there were three more chapters after the twenty-sixth chapter by referring to a letter from N. Raman Pillai, who came to know about the concise narration only after getting the printed copy as he had left to Thiruvananthapuram before the completion of printing, criticized the author regarding the same. According to N. Balakrishnan Nair, the concise version included in twenty-sixth chapter is an abridgement of two intended chapters. C. V. Raman Pillai states in the preamble that he wanted to have an annexure {{at the end of the}} novel.|$|R
50|$|In {{his letter}} to the Reverend Thomas Wilson written in 1788, Cunningham {{referred}} to ‘the former variegated and adversely shaded part of my life’ before taking the curacy at Eyam, which replicates his mention of earlier misfortune and hardship in his first letter to Seward. But now, he continues, ‘I have thoroughly reconciled myself to the obscurity and sequestered nature of my situation’. After the publication of The Naval Triumph, George Rodney had offered to help find him a situation in Ireland but he had refused this, as he did initially an offer of the chaplaincy to the British factory at Smyrna {{so long as there}} was still the possibility of staying on at Eyam after Seward gave up the rectorship. Forced at last to accept the chaplaincy, he left for Smyrna in 1790 and in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>expenses</b> had <b>to</b> sell his books and other possessions. During the years he spent in Turkey he nearly lost his life in a shipwreck, and then in a fire on land which destroyed all his papers. Reduced once more to the utmost poverty, he set out to walk back to Britain across Turkish territory, until he discovered a timely gift of money left in a book of poems with which he had been presented on leaving.|$|R
50|$|During {{this period}} {{the island was}} {{strongly}} garrisoned by regular British regimental troops and by the local St Helena Regiment, with Royal Navy ships circling the island. Agreement was reached that St Helena would {{be placed in the}} hands of a general officer of His Majesty's service during Napoleon's confinement. The British government would <b>meet</b> all <b>expenses</b> relating <b>to</b> the prisoner and would be responsible for both his and the island's security. Sir Hudson Lowe (1816-1821), was duly appointed reporting to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies through the EIC's Secret Committee in London. Brisk business was enjoyed catering for the additional 2,000 troops and personnel on the island over the six-year period, although restrictions placed against ships landing during this period posed a challenge for local traders to import the necessary goods.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{marriage}} in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him {{money and the}} Governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace {{for the next three}} years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could <b>meet</b> increased <b>expenses</b> due <b>to</b> his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.|$|R

50|$|Particularly in {{the case}} of single-parent households, it can be helpful for {{extended}} family members to share a single household in order to share the burden of meeting expenses.

40|$|Excerpt] In May 2001, 7. 8 million persons worked {{multiple}} {{jobs in the}} United States, {{a figure}} representing 5. 7 percent of all workers. Why did these persons choose to work more than one job? To answer this question, the May 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) asked multiple jobholders: 2 ̆ 2 What is the MAIN reason you worked at more than one job? 2 ̆ 2 Respondents were asked to choose among the following response options: <b>Meet</b> <b>expenses</b> or pay off debt, earn extra money, build a business or get experience in a different job, enjoy the second job, or some other reason. Results from the May 2001 supplement reveal that more than 1 in 3 moonlighters worked multiple jobs in order to earn extra money, a category that could include saving for the future or getting extra money to buy something special. An additional 27. 8 percent moonlighted in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>expenses</b> or pay off debt.
