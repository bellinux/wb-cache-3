40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} is to compare {{complete}} genomes to identify preserved large DNA fragments in order to analyse evolution process. For this purpose, we propose an efficient method to identify conserved regions between multiple genomes. We first transform each complete genome into a permutation of Maximal Unique Matches (<b>MUMs).</b> Secondly, we compute the longest common sequence of <b>MUMs</b> in the same order in all the genomes. This permits to define conserved genome segments as long DNA fragments having <b>MUMs</b> in the same order and to analyse evolution events as reversal or transposition of this fragments. Finally, we propose some genomic distances based on <b>MUMs</b> and conserved genome segments length and number. 2. More on <b>MUMs</b> and LCCCs Recently, closely related bacterial genomes have been made available. Comparing these genomes reveals some large scale rearrangements. In particular, chromosomal inversion centered at the origin of replication is an important mechanism involve...|$|R

40|$|On Boxing Day, the {{day after}} Christmas, the village of Marshfield, {{southwest}} England, is, as Nina Lewis says, 2 ̆ 2 Alive with <b>mumming.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The streets are filled with people, {{many of whom are}} strangers. The Marshfield Paper Boys perform an eight minute <b>mumming</b> play at least five times along the village streets at points of historic significance. The crowd follows them to each venue. ^ Scholars often consider British folk drama to be 2 ̆ 2 fragments 2 ̆ 2 of 2 ̆ 2 primitive 2 ̆ 2 religious practices that have 2 ̆ 2 survived. 2 ̆ 2 They believe the performers have little understanding of what the performance of the play means. ^ This is a contextual study of an extant Hero-Combat <b>mumming</b> play as a contemporary event. The <b>mumming</b> tradition is seen as a process in which the <b>mumming</b> play exists. The <b>mumming</b> tradition is one context for the <b>mumming</b> play. Context also includes where the play is performed, why it is performed there, who performs it, who watches it. The history of the play is orally transmitted through the metafolklore or stories told about the play. Through these, the mummers transmit their aesthetics, concept of tradition, and raison d 2 ̆ 7 etre of performance. ^ The gardener 2 ̆ 7 s story tells how public troupe performance of the play lapsed in the 18802 ̆ 7 s. Vicar Alford overheard his gardener performing the play to himself, in the early 19302 ̆ 7 s. His sister, Violet Alford, the folklorist, talked to elderly villagers about the <b>mumming,</b> and public troupe performance was resumed. ^ Part One of the dissertation provides ethnographic information and analysis of the performance of the <b>mumming</b> play. It includes: a socio-economic description of Marshfield; description of the <b>mumming</b> event; discussion {{of the structure of the}} event, audience, the collection, celebration of the <b>mumming,</b> and the significance of the acting sites. Disguise enables villagers to change their role to become mummers. How is this illusion wrought?^ Part Two begins with an ethnographic analysis of the metafolklore. The relationship between text and action is analysed. How do the words fit the drama and who are the characters? The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the Marshfield play in the context of the village community, its repertoire of ritualistic celebration and the political implication of the message. ...|$|R

The first Cascading <b>Mums</b> Display was held on November 3, 1963. On that day, the garden admission fee was waived, and over 14,727 visitors flocked to the Gardens. Stock plants for the cascade <b>mums</b> were obtained from Longwood Gardens in Kennent Square, Penn.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} how the {{tradition}} of <b>mumming</b> in County Fermanagh is defined. Several factors {{have contributed to the}} processes of redefinition <b>mumming</b> has been subjected to. The violent conflict, which is agreed to have erupted in the province of Ulster in 1969, played an integral role in the severe decline of <b>mumming</b> around this period. In the 1980 s, it was revived and <b>mumming</b> groups became a common sight around Christmas time, in local towns and villages. This continued until the 2000 s. However, at present there remains only one <b>mumming</b> group practicing the tradition in Fermanagh: The Aughakillymaude (ACK-LAMAD) Mummers. This thesis explores how <b>mumming</b> has been redefined by both the mummers and the audience. Throughout the thesis, it is argued that while social practices are viewed as possessing longevity and immutability both time and context act to change and define them. <b>mumming</b> exists on the margins of Irish cultural activity. There are no academic departments established to study it, no dedicated archives to store its history, nor are there rules or regulations to bind its existence. Its continuation depends on those involved redefining the tradition. The mummers eke out a space for it through touristic and non-touristic avenues, by framing the tradition as unconventional and marginal. The study challenges notions of the audience, the commodification of tradition, masking, the ability to speak about conflict, reviving a tradition, and the musician. By doing this, it examines how a tradition which exists without any formalities to govern it continues to be redefined and practiced on the margins of Irish cultural activity...|$|R
