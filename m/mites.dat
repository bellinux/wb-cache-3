Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. <b>Mites</b> cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. <b>Mites</b> are also significant crop pests, although predatory <b>mites</b> {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa <b>mites</b> also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa <b>mites</b> within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa <b>mites</b> also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa <b>mites</b> have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these <b>mites.</b>|$|E

40|$|Breeding {{honey bees}} for {{specific}} defined characteristics to obtain varroa <b>mite</b> tolerant bees {{appears to be}} difficult.

40|$|The {{reproduction}} of the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, is inhibited by a sexually transmitted ectoparasitic <b>mite</b> Coccipolipus hippodamiae that sterilizes female hosts, {{and a range of}} heritable microbes that kill male hosts during embryogenesis for instance Spiroplasma. Historical sampling indicated these two parasites were present commonly in A. bipunctata in the south of Sweden but were absent or rare in northern populations. In this thesis, I first established that the distribution of the <b>mite</b> was still stable over time, with a boundary to <b>mite</b> presence at 61 ˚N, as found 10 years previously. The incidence of male-killing Spiroplasma, in contrast, showed a small northward shift in its presence. I then examined the causes of <b>mite</b> presence/absence, and concluded ladybirds from northern populations were competent to carry and transmit <b>mite</b> infection, but that host phenology prevented its persistence in natural populations. I then explored the hypothesis that <b>mite</b> presence might select for increased reluctance of females to mate by comparing mating behaviour between <b>mite</b> present/mite absent populations. I observed that whilst rejection behaviour was protective against <b>mite</b> transmission, it was not more commonly observed in ladybirds derived from <b>mite</b> present populations. Finally, I examined whether the presence of male-killing Spiroplasma might affect <b>mite</b> epidemiology, and whether the <b>mite</b> itself might impact on the dynamics of the male-killing Spiroplasma. I observed that Spiroplasma did not affect individual competence to acquire and transmit <b>mite</b> infection, and did not protect its host against <b>mite</b> induced sterility. However, Spiroplasma was observed to mildly prolong host longevity, which may enhance the capacity of the <b>mite</b> to pass from overwintered to new generation cohorts of its host. Further, population sex ratio biases induced by Spiroplasma were predicted to influence <b>mite</b> epidemiology, through altering mating rate and per contact <b>mite</b> transmission probability. I therefore conclude first that <b>mite</b> incidence can be explained through host phenological variation, and that sex ratio distorting symbionts may impact on the dynamics of the <b>mite</b> infection. Future studies should explore the causes of high prevalence Spiroplasma infection in A. bipunctata in southern Sweden, and the features that prevent the establishment of infection in the north of the country...|$|R
