5000|$|Prior to 2013, {{access to}} ALEC <b>model</b> <b>bills</b> was restricted, and its website {{required}} a password to access them. On July 13, 2011, the Center for Media and Democracy, {{in cooperation with}} The Nation, posted 850 <b>model</b> <b>bills</b> created during a 30-year period, and created a web project, ALEC Exposed, to host these <b>model</b> <b>bills.</b> The leak has been credited with triggering critical coverage about ALEC in both left-wing and mainstream media outlets. ALEC subsequently published its <b>model</b> <b>bills</b> on its website, although the Brookings Institution wrote in 2013 that there was [...] "reason to believe" [...] its list was incomplete.|$|R

I understand that the Victorian Government has agreed to follow several provisions of the <b>model</b> <b>Bill.</b> But there are other parts of the <b>model</b> <b>Bill</b> that the minister has not seen fit to follow. This has all the hallmarks of the Victorian Government trying to take the agenda away from the National Transport Commission, putting in place a process and trying to drive the agenda from that point forward." ...|$|E
5000|$|ALEC has {{promoted}} a <b>model</b> <b>bill</b> that called plans in 2011 {{by the federal}} Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, a [...] "train wreck" [...] that would harm the economy, and it has supported efforts by various states to withdraw from regional climate change compacts. In 2013, their resolution stated [...] "Alec is {{very concerned about the}} potential economic impact of greenhouse gas regulation on electricity prices and the harm EPA regulations may have on the economic recovery".

50|$|ALEC {{provides}} {{a forum for}} state legislators and private sector members to collaborate on model bills—draft legislation that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures. ALEC has produced <b>model</b> <b>bills</b> on {{a broad range of}} issues, such as reducing regulation and individual and corporate taxation, combating illegal immigration, loosening environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, weakening labor unions, and opposing gun control. Some of these bills dominate legislative agendas in states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Maine. Approximately 200 <b>model</b> <b>bills</b> become law each year. ALEC also serves as a networking tool among certain state legislators, allowing them to research conservative policies implemented in other states. Many ALEC legislators say the organization converts campaign rhetoric and nascent policy ideas into legislative language.|$|R

5000|$|ALEC {{does not}} {{disclose}} its membership list nor {{the origins of}} its <b>model</b> <b>bills.</b> Lawmakers generally propose ALEC-drafted bills in their states without disclosing the ALEC authorship.

The connections were based [...] "not on similarity of broad ideas, but on specific numbers, time frames, benchmarks and language". Legislative staffers in the Christie administration had [...] "mined ALEC for advice on budgetary matters, Medicaid changes and privatizing government services...beginning in {{the earliest days of}} Christie's governorship". William Schluter, vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said there was a [...] "clear connection between ALEC and the proposed New Jersey legislation".
