25|$|All processes—chemical, biological, <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> functioning, human {{perception}} {{involving the}} eye and brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light. There is clock functioning at every level, dependent on light speed and the inherent delay at even the atomic level. Biological aging, therefore, {{is in no way}} different from clock time-keeping. This means that biological aging would be slowed {{in the same manner as}} a clock.|$|E
25|$|In Everett's formulation, a <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> M and {{an object}} system S form a {{composite}} system, {{each of which}} prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing M and S to interact. After S interacts with M, {{it is no longer}} possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of S given the state of M or the relative state of M given the state of S. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of S after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of S.|$|E

25|$|His first {{aerodynamic}} experiments, {{an investigation}} of the air resistance of surfaces, was carried out by dropping the surface to be investigated together with a <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> down a vertical cable stretched between the second level of the Eiffel Tower and the ground. Using this Eiffel definitely established that the air resistance of a body was very closely related to the square of the airspeed. He then built a laboratory on the Champ de Mars {{at the foot of the}} tower in 1905, building his first wind tunnel there in 1909. The wind tunnel was used to investigate the characteristics of the airfoil sections used by the early pioneers of aviation such as the Wright Brothers, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot. Eiffel established that the lift produced by an airfoil was the result of a reduction of air pressure above the wing rather than an increase of pressure acting on the under surface. Following complaints about noise from people living nearby, he moved his experiments to a new establishment at Auteuil in 1912. Here it was possible to build a larger wind tunnel, and Eiffel began to make tests using scale models of aircraft designs.|$|E
2500|$|The inequalities above {{focus on}} the {{statistical}} imprecision of observables as quantified by the standard deviation [...] Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the systematic error, a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus,</b> i.e., an observer effect.|$|E
2500|$|Everett's Ph.D. work {{provided}} such {{an alternative}} interpretation. Everett stated {{that for a}} composite system [...] for example a subject (the [...] "observer" [...] or <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus)</b> observing an object (the [...] "observed" [...] system, such as a particle) [...] the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled; we can only specify the state of one relative to the other, i.e., {{the state of the}} observer and the observed are correlated after the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a relativity of states.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of performing simultaneous measurements in {{quantum mechanics is}} investigated {{in the context of}} the Curie-Weiss model for a projective measurement. Concretely, we consider a spin- 1 / 2 system simultaneously interacting with two magnets, which act as <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses</b> of two different spin components. We work out the dynamics of this process and determine the final state of the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses,</b> from which we can find the probabilities of the four possible outcomes of the measurements. The measurement is found to be non-ideal, as (i) the joint statistics do not coincide with the one obtained by separately measuring each spin component, and (ii) the density matrix of the spin does not collapse in either of the measured observables. However, we give an operational interpretation of the process as a generalised quantum measurement, and show that it is fully informative: The expected value of the measured spin components can be found with arbitrary precision for sufficiently many runs of the experiment.

2500|$|The {{probabilistic}} {{nature of}} quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This {{is one of the}} most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr–Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the formulation {{of quantum mechanics}}, the question of what constitutes a [...] "measurement" [...] has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of [...] "wave function collapse" [...] (see, for example, the relative state interpretation). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus,</b> their respective wave functions become entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|The Everett many-worlds interpretation, {{formulated}} in 1956, holds {{that all the}} possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. This is not accomplished by introducing some [...] "new axiom" [...] to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by removing the axiom {{of the collapse of}} the wave packet. All of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum superposition. Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these [...] "parallel universes" [...] will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away {{at the speed of light}} towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory). In light of these Bell tests, Cramer (1986) formulated his transactional interpretation. Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the Copenhagen Interpretation.|$|E

40|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} relation for measurement {{noise and}} disturbance states that any position measurement with noise epsilon brings the momentum disturbance {{not less than}} hbar/ 2 epsilon. This relation holds only for restricted class of <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Here, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation is generalized to a relation that holds for all the possible quantum measurements, from which conditions are obtained for <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses</b> to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. In particular, every apparatus with the noise and the disturbance statistically independent from the measured object is proven to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. For this purpose, all the possible quantum measurements are characterized by naturally acceptable axioms. Then, a mathematical notion of the distance between probability operator valued measures and observables is introduced and the basic properties are explored. Based on this notion, the measurement noise and disturbance are naturally defined for any quantum measurements in a model independent formulation. Under this formulation, various uncertainty relations are also derived for apparatuses with independent noise, independent disturbance, unbiased noise, and unbiased disturbance as well as noiseless apparatuses and nondisturbing apparatuses. Two models of position measurements are discussed to show that Heisenberg's relation can be violated even by approximately repeatable position measurements. Comment: 35 pages, revte...|$|R
