5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground in respect to Henry, capitalising on {{his reputation as a}} crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not at the apex of the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E
5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E
25|$|Writers {{turned to}} poetry and fiction to {{continue}} a debate which had been started centuries earlier by Guanzi and the Han dynasty Discourses on Salt and Iron: practical men argued that monopoly revenues helped the state {{to carry out its}} mission while Confucian critics argued that government monopolies made some groups rich and left others poor and exploited, and that salt taxes afflicted the people and encouraged expansionary wars which would doom the empire. Each side claimed the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground.|$|E

In response, Vitaly Churkin, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN, attacked the U.S. claim to <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground by recalling its invasion of Iraq in 2003. Others accused the United States of hypocrisy, citing its support of the violation of Serbian territorial integrity when it recognised the independence of Kosovo in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Students {{began the}} hunger strike on 13 May, two {{days prior to}} the highly publicized state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Knowing that the {{welcoming}} ceremony for Gorbachev {{was scheduled to be}} held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there as a bargaining chip to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground that it sought. By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.|$|E
25|$|Aderca's take on fascism {{was more}} {{ambiguous}} than his stance on antisemitism. In {{addition to the}} retrospective parable in Muzică de balet, {{a number of his}} earlier texts feature more or less explicit anti-fascist tropes. This is the case of 1916, with its grim prognosis of radical nationalism, and Oameni excepționali, where Nazism appears as a heterogeneous ideology. Aderca saw Adolf Hitler as a pale copy of Stalin and a reluctant follower of Marxian economics, propelled into high office by the inconsistencies of the German Communist Party. According to Zalis, anti-fascistm is even present in the 1940 study of Peter the Great: Hitler was destroying a Europe that Peter had once helped civilize. In the late 1940s, investigating the wartime antisemitic crimes, Aderca objected to violent retribution, noting that victims had gained the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Ji Yan (died 224), {{courtesy}} name Zixiu, was {{an official}} of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. An impulsive and impetuous man, he thought highly of himself and liked to assume the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground to criticise and disparage others. While serving in the selection bureau (the equivalent of a present-day human resources department), he came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy by demoting or dismissing officials based on assessments of their moral character. His ideas proved to be highly unpopular as he incurred much resentment from his colleagues, who accused him of being unprofessional and biased. When his colleagues Lu Xun, Lu Mao and Zhu Ju advised him to change his offensive behaviour, he ignored their well-meaning advice. In 224, he committed suicide after he was removed from office on allegations of unprofessional conduct.|$|E

500|$|After {{nearly a}} year of intense {{activism}} with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a [...] "Day of Penance" [...] to promote nonviolence and maintain the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement, the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.|$|E
500|$|Dredd used various [...] "dirty tricks" [...] to {{undermine}} the March. He blackmailed the organisers by fabricating evidence against them and threatening to leak it to the press. He told Gort Hyman {{that if he did}} not withdraw he would conscript his children into the Academy of Law to be trained as cadet judges (the Academy does not require parental consent). He arrested an elderly leader on a trumped-up charge and made him stand all night without sleep or food, before releasing him minutes before the March was due to start, so that he would collapse from exhaustion along the way, undermining morale. Dredd ordered Weather Control to produce rain to reduce attendance. By the time the March started, numbers were well below the expected turnout. Undercover judges planted as agitators in the crowd first undermined morale by defeatist talk, and then incited violence by throwing things at uniformed judges, giving Dredd the excuse he needed to send in riot squads to break up the March and make arrests. The organisers were sentenced to significant terms of incarceration. Yet publicly, the Judges appeared to have the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground.|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} {{mounting}} political opposition against Chancellor Jia Sidao. Jia had purged several dissident officials who {{were opposed to}} his reforms aimed at limiting official corruption and personal profiteering. When he replaced some of these officials with his own cronies, however, political conditions were ripe for a schism at court and within the gentry class that would be favorable to a strong, unified force led by Kublai. Kublai used various ploys and gestures in order to entice defectors from the Southern Song to his side. Kublai Khan established Dadu (Beijing) as his new capital in 1264, catering {{to the likes of}} the Chinese with his advisor Liu Bingzhong and the naming of his dynasty with the Chinese word for [...] "primal" [...] ("Yuan"). He made it a policy to grant land, clothing, and oxen to Song Chinese who defected to his side. Kublai Khan chose the <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground of releasing Song captives and prisoners while Jia Sidao refused to release Kublai's emissary Hao Jing. In 1261 Kublai personally released seventy-five Song merchants captured at the border; in 1263 he released fifty-seven merchants; in 1269 he released forty-five merchants. In 1264 he publicly reprimanded his own officers for executing two Song generals without trial or investigation. With these acts his reputation and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} Chinese were greatly enhanced.|$|E
