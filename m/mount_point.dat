50|$|A <b>mount</b> <b>point,</b> in {{streaming}} media systems, {{is a virtual}} resource which references live or on-demand content within a multimedia media server system. Mount points are used to allow multimedia servers {{the ability to control}} multiple content sources and/or types on the same server instance. The <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> name is typically determined in the path location portion of a URI. Channel content and attributes can be stored with <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> definitions and kept separate of global and other <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> settings and limits. This term in {{streaming media}} was popularized by the Icecast server and is used in many software products that support it and others like it.|$|E

40|$|Up to now the {{calculation}} of the speed limit of <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> is carried out {{on the base of}} EN 13236 using a simple analytical method. The results are correct for <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> with shanks of a constant diameter. However results for shouldered shanks reveal considerable derivations compared to finite element analyses (FEA) or measured results. As a consequence the real speed limit is not clear and the <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> cannot be used up to their objective limit of performance. FEA software and test devices for a reliable estimation of the failure speed limit are not available to all manufacturers and users of <b>mounted</b> <b>points.</b> Therefore a new analytical model has been developed. In an associated computer program the results of FEA as well as notch effects and the surface quality are taken into consideration. In order to validate the computed results a test method for <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> has been developed. First tests have been carried out with good results...|$|R

50|$|The mount command instructs the {{operating}} system that a file system is ready to use, and associates it with a particular point in the overall file system hierarchy (its <b>mount</b> <b>point)</b> and sets options relating to its access. Mounting makes file systems, files, directories, devices and special files available for use and available to the user. Its counterpart umount instructs {{the operating}} system that the file system should be disassociated from its <b>mount</b> <b>point,</b> making it no longer accessible and may {{be removed from the}} computer. It is important to umount a device before removing it since changes to files may have only partially been written and are completed as part of the umount.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{need for}} special {{configuration}} files; the setup is as simple as one mount command (or one line in fstab). There is no specific communication protocol, at mount time the invoking parameters indicate two or more paths to directories which will be the replicated underlying filesystems (they must be already in sync). This allows the client to use any kind of underlying filesystems such as Ext3, NFS or SSHFS and even mix them. Every write in the Chiron FS <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> subtree will be echoed to the underlying filesystems.
