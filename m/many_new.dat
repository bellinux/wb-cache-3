5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in Lazio. While a relative moderate among House Republicans, Lazio had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among <b>many</b> <b>New</b> Yorkers. Lazio did {{bring to the}} table an ethnic suburban background familiar to <b>many</b> <b>New</b> Yorkers, and had a reputation as an energetic campaigner.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, <b>many</b> <b>new</b> food {{products}} became {{available to the}} typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw <b>many</b> <b>new</b> kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E

5|$|A 2003 study {{claimed the}} Stanley's {{renovation}} brought positive economic effects to the theatre's local area, bounded by 8th Street and 17th between Fir and Hemlock.

Business respondents also reportedly had a positive view of the theatre's effects.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} <b>many</b> <b>new</b> transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

Expeditions involving Japanese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, {{as well as}} private expeditions hosted by Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie {{around the turn of}} the 21st century, discovered and collected further Tarbosaurus material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 skulls and several complete postcranial skeletons.|$|E

5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and <b>many</b> <b>new</b> immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates <b>many</b> <b>new</b> elements.|$|E
