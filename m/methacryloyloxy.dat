The diblock copolymer vesicles described herein are based on poly(2 - (<b>methacryloyloxy)</b> ethyl phosphorylcholine-block- 2 - (diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) [PMPC-PDPA]: the biomimetic PMPC block is known to facilitate rapid cell uptake {{for a wide range of}} cell lines, while the PDPA block constitutes the pH-responsive component that enables facile vesicle self-assembly in aqueous solution.

Parameters including polymerization time, temperature, and ELD conditions are studied to optimize the whole fabrication process. The as-made conductive textiles exhibit sheet resistance as low as 0. 2 Omega sq(- 1), which makes them highly suitable for use as conductive wires and interconnects in flexible and wearable electronic devices.

The core of the nanowires consists of a silsesquioxane network synthesized through a precursor route. The shell consists of a dense layer of poly N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate PDMAEMA. The hybrid nanowires exhibit pH responsive behavior, because of the weak polyelectrolyte nature of the PDMAEMA shell.

Poly(dimethyl(methacryloyloxy) methyl phosphonate) (PMAPC 1) was synthesized in DMF at 70 C with a good control over the molecular weight, the latter ranging from 8000 to 24 000 g mol 1. Polymers were characterized by 1 H and 31 P NMR, and size exclusion chromatography using both refractive index and triple detection. The effect of the solvent was also investigated. We demonstrated that polarity had an effect on the control of the polymerization as low polarity led to low polymerization rate and termination reactions whereas very high polarity resulted in high polymerization rate but also transfer reactions. Additionally, we showed that it was possible to restart the RAFT polymerization from a PMAPC 1 macrochain transfer agent.

Above 5 Â°C aqueous multilamellar dispersions of 1, 2, and 3 show a broad-phase transition, no phase change, and a sharp transition, respectively. Polymerization of the methacrylate group causes a decrease in membrane fluidity in each case {{and an increase in}} the temperature of the gross phase change for 1 and 3. Membrane fluidity in copolymerized vesicles of 1 and 2 decreases linearly with the mole fraction of 2 used.

Fluidity gradients are also present in membranes of 1, 2, and 3 above 20 Â°C. Polymerization alters the fluidity gradients in a manner which is comparable to lowering the temperature; it also reduces the ability of each membrane to bind [^(15) N]perdeuteriotempone.

40|$|In molecularly {{imprinted}} polymers (MIPs) a {{high level}} of cross-linking is usually important for preserving the receptor structure. We propose here an alternative approach for stabilising binding sites, which involves the use of an immobilised template. The idea {{is based on the assumption}} that an immobilised template will ââholdââ polymeric chains and complementary functionalities together, preventing the collapsing of the binding sites. To test this postulate, a range of polymers was prepared using polymerisable (2, 4 -diamino- 6 - (<b>methacryloyloxy)</b> ethyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) and non-polymerisable (or extractable) (2, 4 -diamino- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) templates, methacrylic acid as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker. The level of cross- linking was varied from 12 to 80 %. Polymerisations were performed in acetonitrile using UV initiation. Binding properties of the synthesised materials were characterised both by HPLC and equilibrium batch binding experiments followed by HPLC-MS or UV-visible detection. The adsorption isotherms of polymers were obtained and fitted to the Langmuir model to calculate dissociation constant, Kd, and concentration of binding sites for each material. The results strongly indicate that the presence of an immobilised template improves the affinity of MIPs containing low percentages of cross- linker. The low cross-linked MIPs synthesised with a polymerisable template also retain a reasonable degree of selectivity. Low crosslinked MIPs with such binding characteristics would be useful for the creation of new types of optical and electrochemical sensors, where induced fit or the ââgate effectââ could be used more effectively for generating and enhancin...|$|E

In all the cases, the chromophore bound to the polymer is more photostable than that simply dissolved in the same polymer, with photodegradation quantum yields in the range 2 : 331025 to 4 : 831025, which was interpreted as due to additional modes for the dissipation of the absorbed energy along the polymeric chain.

Both methods were applied under varying polymerisation conditions, and the kinetics of the systems investigated. Various rate constants were measured, while computer modelling of the experimental data allowed estimation of other kinetic parameters of interest. Investigations into solvent and ligand effects on the kinetics of ATRP of the activated ester <b>methacryloyloxy</b> succinimide (MAOS) and one of the archetypal methacrylate monomers, methyl methacrylate (MMA) were carried out.

Preparation of PHPMA from PMAOS, PMAC and PNPMA was attempted. Successful preparation of PHPMA from the polymer of the acid chloride was achieved under mild reaction conditions, while displacement of N-hydroxysuccinimide groups of PMAOS resulted in unexpected modification of the polymer under the conditions used.

In order to investigate the extraction capacity of the new coating for inorganic anion, the new SBSE was combined with ionic chromatography with conductivity detection, Br-, NO 3 -, PO 43 - and SO 42 - were selected as detected solutes. Several extractive parameters, including pH value and ionic strength in sample matrix, desorption solvent, extraction and desorption time were optimized.

40|$|Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerisation}} (ATRP) of styrene in xylene solution initiated with 1 -phenylethyl bromide and mediated by CuBr/N-propyl- 2 - pyridinemethanimine catalyst complex was studied. The polymerisation was ill-controlled, yielding polymers with broad molecular weight distributions {{and values of}} {{number average molecular weight}} considerably higher than the theoretical values calculated from 100 % initiator efficiency. The degree of control afforded over the polymerisation was enhanced by use of a more soluble catalyst complex, CuBr/N-octyl- 2 -pyridinemethanimine. Furthermore, the use of a more polar solvent, diglyme, generated a homogeneous catalyst complex that facilitated the production of polymers having narrow molecular weight distributions (1. 10 < PDi < 1. 20). The kinetics of the atom transfer radical polymerisation of methyl methacrylate at 90 Â°C in diglyme solution initiated with ethyl- 2 -bromoisobutyrate and mediated by CuBr/N-octyl- 2 -pyridinemethanimine was studied and the orders of the reaction were established. The effect on the rate of polymerisation of the ratio of CuBr:N-octyl- 2 -pyridinemethanimine was also determined. The temperature dependencies of the rate of polymerisation of methyl methacrylate in diglyme solution and xylene solution were studied, and were found to be non-linear and dependent upon the polarity of the solvent. The use of highly polar aprotic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide, was found to be detrimental to the degree of control afforded over the polymerisation of methyl methacrylate. This was circumvented by use of a 5 -fold excess, over that conventionally used, of catalyst complex.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of novel functional (co) polyesters and copolyester resins based on e-caprolactone and functional e-caprolactones as well as (co) polyesters based on w-pentadecalactone and functional macrocyclic lactones or functional e-caprolactones. The characteristics of these polyesters were evaluated {{with respect to their}} molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, composition, microstructure, and concentration of the functional groups. The degradation of polyester resins obtained via photo-crosslinking and via Michael addition was studied as a function of crosslink density. Microstructured materials with tunable degradation rate suitable for drug delivery carriers were prepared and characterized. All functional e-caprolactones used in this thesis are g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones which were prepared in two steps starting from 4 -hydroxy-cyclohexanone. In the first step acylation of the hydroxyl group occurs and in the second step ring enlargement by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. If the reaction sequence is inverted rearrangement occurs in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 4 -hydroxy cyclohexanone leading to g-hydroxyethyl-g-butyrolactone. Using the first procedure g-acetyloxy- (AcetCL), g-benzoyloxy- (BenzCL), g-acryloyloxy- (AcrCL), and g- methacryloyloxy-e-caprolactone (McrCL) were prepared. These monomers and for comparison reasons e-caprolactone and g-methyl-e-caprolactone were polymerized by means of chemical and enzymatic catalysis. The functional repeating units in copolyesters obtained from e-caprolactone and g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones change the crystallinity of the copolyester, in case of AcrCL and McrCL are used for the preparation of copolyester resins and the preparation of microstructured surfaces. It is expected that the rate of degradation of these polymers can be finely tuned {{by the nature of the}} acyl group and the concentration of the g-acyloxy-e-caprolactone repeating units. The expectation is based on the fact that the hydrolysis of the ester side chains or thermal treatment of the polymers releases the corresponding acid from the respective acyloxy side chain, which serves as a catalyst for further degradation (biotic acid generator). Copolymerization of e-caprolactone with g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones was performed using chemical and enzymatic catalysis. All monomers, except AcetCL, undergo controlled ringopening polymerization using chemical catalysts such as aluminium isopropoxide under selected reaction conditions. AcetCL, however, rearranges to a large extent under all polymerization conditions to give g-acetyloxyethyl-g-butyrolactone. In the presence of an enzyme (Novozyme 435, Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) immobilized on a macroporous resin) all g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones, except BenzCL, partly rearrange to result in the corresponding g-acyloxy-g-butyrolactones, while e-caprolactone (CL) and g-methyl-e- caprolactone yield the corresponding polymers, the latter even in a stereoselective manner as reported earlier in the literature. This is the first time that rearrangement during polymerization was observed. A molecular dynamic study was performed with AcetCL and BenzCL as tetrahedral intermediates in the active-site of CALB to get information on the substrate recognition displayed by the enzyme. Based on the experimental results and the molecular dynamic studies a mechanism for the chemically and enzymatically catalyzed reactions of g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones was proposed. Novel biodegradable polyester resins were prepared via photo-crosslinking of functional polyesters obtained by copolymerization of CL with AcrCL and McrCL. Copolymers with different content of either acryloyloxy or <b>methacryloyloxy</b> functional groups were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of g-acyloyloxy-e-caprolactones and CL using Al(OiPr) 3 as catalyst and initiator. 2 D- and 3 D-micropatterning of the copolymers was performed via UVcrosslinking of polymer films on a suitable substrate by UV replica moulding on both rigid and elastic masters, showing the processability of these novel functional polyesters and their potential as substrates for biomedical devices. Degradation experiments on the polyester resins obtained via photo-crosslinking of <b>methacryloyloxy</b> and diamine-crosslinking of acryloyloxy pendant groups were performed. The presence of the functional groups affects the degradation rate of the copolymer: the degradation rate being faster with a higher degree of functionalization. Polyesters consisting of a poly(e-caprolactone) backbone bearing pendant acryloyloxy and <b>methacryloyloxy</b> groups in different amounts were successfully used also in preparation of biodegradable microparticle drug carriers. Stable microparticles can be prepared via an oil/water emulsion-solvent evaporation technique if polymers with up to 8 % acryloyloxy groups are used. If higher amounts of pendant groups are present the emulsion solvent evaporation technique is combined with a simultaneous crosslinking procedure to confer stability to the particles. We were successful in obtaining crosslinked particles with two different methods: UV irradiation in the presence of a photoinitiator and Michael type addition with diamines. Encapsulation of a hydrophobic fluorescent dye and a hydrophilic protein, as model drugs, were performed and confirmed by optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of the functional groups allow not only for tunable degradability, but also for further processing (e. g. crosslinking) and (bio) functionalization, broadening the potential use of polycaprolactones in biomedical applications. Poly(pentadecalactone) (PPDL) is a polyester of high crystallinity, with a melting point around 95 Â°C. PPDL is nontoxic and although a polyester, shows no hydrolytic enzyme catalyzed degradation. This is ascribed to the high crystallinity and hydrophobicity of the materials. In order to enhance the degradability of PPDL copolymerization of PDL with g-acyloyloxy-e- caprolactones monomers were performed via enzymatic catalysis. It is expected that by integration of functional pendant groups, as acid generators, along the PPDL backbone degradability can be tailored. It was observed that by using AcetCL and AcrCL as comonomers, no copolymers were obtained; the result of the copolymerization was PPDL and rearranged AcetCL and AcrCL. Using McrCL and BenzCL as comonomers random copolyesters were obtained and no rearrangement was observed. Gas chromatographic analysis using chiral columns of non converted monomer during copolymerization of BenzCL and PDL revealed that one of the enantiomeric monomers is preferentially consumed. As a consequence optical active copolyester are obtained. Copolymerization of PDL with CL and BenzCL leads to nearly quantitative monomer conversion affording PDL based polyesters which are expected to show an enhanced degradation rate. Copolymerization of PDL with functional macrolactones represents another versatile and straightforward method to introduce functionalities along the PPDL backbone. Pentadecalactone based copolymers with C,C-double bonds, epoxide rings and amide functional groups in the backbone were obtained by copolymerizing PDL with ambrettolide, ambrettolide epoxide and a cyclic ester amide. It is expected that by reducing the crystallinity of the copolymers an enhanced degradation rate will be observed...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{environmental}} awareness and the not so distant scarcity of fossil feedstocks are promoting nowadays {{a renewed interest}} in the use of renewable raw materials derived from biomass, i. e., cellulosic products. Recently, a relatively novel type of cellulose product namely, bacterial cellulose, biosynthesised by cellulose-producing bacteria Gluconobacter xylinus, has appeared as a promising raw material for the development of advanced renewable (nano-) materials owing to its outstanding properties such as inherent nanosize (width: 1 to 25 nm; length: 1 to 9 m), high degree of crystallinity (70 % to 90 %) and impressive mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 78 to 155 GPa). This thesis describes the preparation of different types of renewable (nano-) materials composed of bacterial cellulose, which includes all-cellulose hierarchical composites, macroporous cryogel microspheres, functional bioinorganic nanohybrids and entirely bacterial-based nanocomposites. Bacterial cellulose was deposited around the surface of sisal fibres by Gluconobacter xylinus, which resulted in a dense bacterial cellulose coating of the surfaces of sisal fibres. Furthermore, the bacterial cellulose coated sisal fibres obtained after surface modification of fibres enhanced the mechanical performance of all-cellulose hierarchical composites owing to an improvement {{of the quality of the}} sisal fibres-regenerated cellulose matrix interface. Bacterial cellulose manofibrils were dissolved in DMAc/LiCl cosolvent, then templated into a microsphere shape, regenerated in H 2 O and freeze-dried to obtain highly porous cryogel microspheres composed exclusively of regenerated bacterial cellulose, which possessed a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area ranging from 55 m 2 /g to 123 m 2 /g. Thioether functionalised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils were synthesised using a "grafting from" approach during the free radical grafting polymerisation of a monomer containing thioether moieties, namely 2 -(methylthio) ethyl methacrylate. The thioether moieties grafted from the bacterial cellulose (MTEMA-g-BC) nanofibrils subsequently enabled the preparation of optically functional bioinorganic nanohybrids, where either gold nanoparticles or cadmium telluride quantum dots were chemisorbed onto the thioether moieties functionalised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils. Hydrophobised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils were also synthesised using the same "grafting from" approach using free radical grafting polymerisation of a hydrophobic caprolactone-based macromonomer, caprolactone 2 - (<b>methacryloyloxy)</b> ethyl ester. Then, entirely bacterial-based nanocomposites composed of caprolactone grafted bacterial cellulose (PCLMA-g-BC) nanofibrils reinforced poly(3 - hydroxy- butyrate) (PHB) matrix were produced by solution casting. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of bacterial-based nanocomposites reinforced with PCLMA- g-BC nanofibrils (i. e., nanofiller content of 10 wt. /wt. %) increased by 101 % and 170 %, respectively, as compared to the neat PHB lm. The findings reported in this thesis highlight the potential and versatility of bacterial cellulose to produce novel and innovative types of renewable advanced (nano-) materials and composites.

40|$|Scientists in polymer science are {{attempting}} to provide synthetic tissues that serve as alternative biomechanical role in the body, such as articular cartilage, semilunar cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. To effectively replace the natural tissues with artificial materials, {{a number of significant}} engineering challenges like suitable elastic modulus, high mechanical strength, appropriate water content, low surface friction and wear are to be solved. Hydrogels have provided most of these demands until now. an articular cartilage,that is a kind of hydrogel containing 70 % water exhibits little wear under a load as high as several to a hundred megapascals and millions of cycles {{with a wide range of}} sliding velocities. Gong and co-workers have reported a unique method of obtaining hydrogels with extremely high mechanical toughness which is a composition of two networks-a polyelectrolyte and a neutral polymer (double-network hydrogel). Later on a number hydrogels with different characteristics have been designed for different various purposes. Some of them show low friction and low wear properties which opens a new era of soft and wet materials as substitutes for articular cartilage and other tissues. Studies on the surface sliding friction of various types of bulk hydrogel revealed very rich and complex frictional behavior In previous studies on the friction of gels against solid substrates in water, a complicated velocity dependence of the frictional stress was observed, and the frictional behavior was strongly dependent on the interfacial interaction between the gel and the solid substrate. On a repulsive surface such as a negatively charged polyelectrolyte gel on a piece of glass that has negative charges on its surface in water, we observed a monotonic increase in the friction with velocity. On an adhesive substrate, we often observed a distinct friction transition with velocity. The transition behavior was influenced by various parameters such as the chemical combination of the gel and the substrate, the viscosity of the aqueous liquid, the elastic modulus of the gel, and the normal strain (pressure) applied on the gel. This friction transition in liquids appears to be similar to the elasto hydrodynamic transition observed for solid friction in liquids. Mechanistic models have been proposed to explain the friction transition for adhesive and non adhesive interfaces. However, different hydrogels have different mechanical strength, swelling degree and chemical composition. So, it was not possible to compare the frictional characteristics of adhesive and non adhesive interfaces on a same platform. To overcome this problem using zwitterionic hydrogels can be an effective solution, which can be made adhesive and non-adhesive by altering the pH. Moreover,the swelling and mechanical properties of polyelectrolytes are susceptible to ionicstrength and pH of the swelling medium. Recently zwitterionic hydrogel composed of poly carboxymethyl dimethyl (<b>methacryloyloxy)</b> ethanaminium, inner salt (PCDME) is designed, which can keep its swelling and mechanical properties unchanged over a wide range of pH and ionic strength. This provides us an excellent opportunity to study the friction with various ionic strength and pH as well as to understand the adhesive and non adhesive interface in a microscopic viewãã®åå£«è«æå¨æã®é²è¦§æ¹æ³ã«ã¤ãã¦ã¯ãä»¥ä¸ã®ãµã¤ãããåç§ãã ããã[URL]...|$|E
