50|$|Urea-formaldehyde foam {{insulation}} (UFFI) {{dates to the}} 1930s and made a synthetic insulation with R-values near 5.0 per inch. It is a foam, like shaving cream, that is easily injected or pumped into walls. It is made by using a pump set and hose with a <b>mixing</b> <b>gun</b> to mix the foaming agent, resin and compressed air. The fully expanded foam is pumped into areas in need of insulation. It becomes firm within minutes but cures within a week. UFFI is generally found in homes built before the 1970s, often in basements, crawl spaces, attics, and unfinished attics. Visually it looks like oozing liquid that has been hardened. Over time, it tends to vary in shades of butterscotch but new UFFI is a light yellow color. Early forms of UFFI tended to shrink significantly. Modern UF insulation with updated catalysts and foaming technology have reduced shrinkage to minimal levels (between 2-4%). The foam dries with a dull matte color with no shine. When cured, it often has a dry and crumbly texture.|$|E
5000|$|External <b>mixing</b> <b>guns</b> have {{a nozzle}} {{spraying}} {{water as a}} stream and air nozzles shooting air through this water stream to break it up into much smaller water particles. These guns are sometimes equipped {{with a set of}} internal mixing nozzles that are known as nucleators. These help create a nucleus for the water droplets to bond to as they freeze. External <b>mixing</b> <b>guns</b> are typically tower guns and rely on a longer hang time to freeze the snow. This allows them to use much less air. External <b>mixing</b> <b>guns</b> are usually reliant on high water pressure to operate correctly so the water supply is opened completely, though in some the flow can be regulated by valves on the gun.|$|R

5000|$|Internal <b>mixing</b> <b>guns</b> have {{a chamber}} {{where the water}} and air are mixed {{together}} and forced through jets or through holes and {{fall to the ground}} as snow. These guns are typically low to the ground on a frame or tripod and require a lot of air to compensate for the short hang time (time the water is airborne). Some newer guns are built in a tower form and use much less air because of the increased hang time. The amount of water flow determines the type of snow that is to be made and is controlled by an adjustable water valve.|$|R
5000|$|The smoothbore {{artillery}} {{was also}} categorized by the bore dimensions, {{based on the}} rough weight of the solid shot projectile fired from the weapon. For instance a 12-pounder field gun fired a 12-pound solid shot projectile from its 4.62 in diameter bore. It was practice, {{dating back to the}} 18th century, to <b>mix</b> <b>gun</b> and howitzers into batteries. Pre-war allocations called for 6-pounder field guns matched with 12-pounder howitzers, 9 and 12-pounder field guns matched with 24-pounder howitzers. But the rapid expansions of both combatant armies, mass introduction of rifled artillery, and the versatility of the 12-pounder [...] "Napoleon" [...] class of weapons all contributed to a change in the mixed battery practices.|$|R

40|$|Effect of hand packing versus {{cement gun}} {{pressurization}} on cement mantle in total knee arthroplasty Background: Gun pressurization in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{may result in}} better cement penetration than hand packing, leading to fewer tibial plate failures. We com-pared cement intrusion characteristics between vacuum <b>mixing</b> and <b>gun</b> pressurization versus hand mixing and packing in the proximal tibia among patients undergoing TKA. Methods: We analyzed 6 -week radiographs from 77 consecutive patients for cement area and zone-specific intrusion using computer-assisted image analysis. Results: Penetration into tibial anteroposterior zones 1 – 6 was not significantly differ-ent between the techniques. Intrusion depths in anteroposterior zone 7 and lateral zone 2 were significantly increased with gun pressurization, but this increase was asso-ciated with significantly longer operating room and tourniquet times. Conclusion: We identified no obvious advantage of vacuum <b>mixing</b> with <b>gun</b> pres-surization, suggesting that continued use of the hand-packing technique may be war...|$|R

50|$|Just a {{few weeks}} before the Fall of France, the Oerlikon factory {{approved}} manufacture of their gun in the United Kingdom, under licence. The Royal Navy managed to smuggle out the necessary drawings and documents from Zürich. The production of the first British-made Oerlikon guns started in Ruislip, London, at the end of 1940. The first guns were delivered to the Royal Navy in March or April, 1941. The RAF Regiment made extensive use of Oerlikon guns in the anti-aircraft role. These were the principal armament for its Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, and North Western Europe, until the introduction of the Bofors 40/L60 40mm gun from 1943, although many squadrons retained a <b>mix</b> of <b>guns</b> until the end of World War 2.

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand lay-up. In this process, the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of gelcoat is applied. The gelcoat is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the gelcoat hardens, a spray gun is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The spray gun chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the <b>gun</b> (<b>gun</b> <b>mixing)</b> or {{just in front of the}} <b>gun.</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>mixing</b> provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. Airless spray guns are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized spray gun system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|R

The main source of lead in water may be from contaminated wastes and also from the corrosions of lead batteries/pipes. The lead accumulation in plant tissues showed maximum concentration in the whole plant of aquatic macrophytes. Baldantoni et al. (2004) reported that the shoots of Najas marina show higher concentrations of lead. Lemna minor was observed with higher concentrations of lead (12.68  mg kg− 1) during the summer which {{may be due to}} photosynthetic efficiency of the plant during their growing period that absorb more and more elements from the growing media. The highest concentration of lead in Lemna minor was also observed by Pillai (2010). Babovic et al. (2010) observed that the leaves of Phragmites communis accumulated less concentrations of lead. Lead is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in plant and animal tissues through ingestion by food, water and inhalation. Lead sulphide or galena (PbS) is the common form of lead. The main source of lead in the sediment is from lead pipes, <b>mixing</b> of <b>gun</b> powder, waste batteries, etc., into the aquatic systems, which causes lead deposition.
