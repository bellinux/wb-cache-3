Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> over traditional {{wood and}} hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> on the army, which he both feared and admired, in {{accordance}} with the advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> to {{spending}} time alone.

25|$|These three {{components}} make up nature connectedness and {{are required for}} a healthy relationship with nature.

25|$|Even though humans derive <b>many</b> <b>benefits</b> from nature, {{our modern}} lifestyles {{have created a}} {{disconnect}} from the natural environment wherein we spend significantly more time indoors.

As a result, we are less connected to nature and feel less responsibility to protect this environment.|$|E
