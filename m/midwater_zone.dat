5000|$|Narrowly defined, Coregonus artedi {{is known}} {{variously}} {{with the common}} names cisco, northern cisco, lake herring, chub or tullibee and its Anishinaabe name Otoonapii. It is a pelagic fish occurring in the <b>midwater</b> <b>zone</b> of cold water lakes in North America. In the northern and western parts of its range it {{is also found in}} large rivers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mesopelagic zone}} is the upper {{section of the}} <b>midwater</b> <b>zone,</b> and extends from 200 to 1000 m below sea level. This is colloquially known as the [...] "twilight zone" [...] as light can still {{penetrate}} this layer, {{but it is too}} low to support photosynthesis. The limited amount of light, however, can still allow organisms to see, and creatures with a sensitive vision can detect prey, communicate, and orientate themselves using their sight. Organisms in this layer have large eyes to maximize the amount of light in the environment.|$|E
5000|$|The bathyl zone is {{the lower}} {{section of the}} <b>midwater</b> <b>zone,</b> and {{encompasses}} the depths of 1000 to 4000 m. Light does not reach this zone, giving it its nickname [...] "the midnight zone"; {{due to the lack}} of light, it is less densely population than the epipelagic zone, despite being much larger. Fish find it hard to live in this zone, as there is crushing pressure, cold temperatures of 4 C, a low level of dissolved oxygen, and a lack of sufficient nutrients. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5% filters down to the bathypelagic zone. The fish that do live there may have reduced or completely lost their gills, kidneys, hearts, and swimbladders, have slimy instead of scaly skin, and have a weak skeletal and muscular build. Most of the animals that live in the bathyl zone are invertebrates such as sea sponges, cephalopods, and echinoderms. With the exception of very deep areas of the ocean, the bathyl zone usually reaches the benthic zone on the seafloor.|$|E
40|$|Deep-water {{sedimentary}} {{sequences of}} mid-Cretaceous age, rich in organic carbon, {{have been recovered}} at many DSDP sites in the Atlantic Ocean. Most of these sequences have a marked cyclicity in amount of organic carbon resulting in interbedded multicolored shale, marlstone, and (or) limestone that have cycle periods of 20, 000 to 100, 000 years and average 40, 000 to 50, 000 years. These cycles {{may be related to}} some climatic control on influx of terrigenous organic matter and sediment, rates of upwelling and sea-surface production of organic matter, and preservation of organic matter related to deeper-water dissolved oxygen concentration. These variations in supply of organic matter had pronounced effects on the potential of the sediment for subsequent diagenetic changes and geochemical partitioning in adjacent beds. Many trace elements are enriched in organic-carbon-rich lithologies relative to interbedded organic-carbon-poor lithologies. Elements that are most commonly enriched are Cr, Ni, V, Cu, Zn, and Mo. The association of high traceelement concentrations with organic matter {{may be the result of}} concentration of these elements by organisms or by chemical sorption and precipitation processes under anoxic conditions. Detailed trace-element profiles from organiccarbon- rich strata at Site 530 suggest that there may be differential mobility of trace elements, with diffusion of some elements over distances of at least tens of meters. The sequence of trace-element mobility, from highest to lowest, is approximately Ba, Mn, Pb, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, Zn, V, Cd, and Mo. Slowly deposited, oxidized clays directly overlying some black shale sequences are enriched in some metals, particularly Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu, relative to normal pelagic clays, and this enrichment may be the result of upward migration of metals in pore waters during compaction or diffusion from the underlying black shale. Most depositional models that have been used to explain the accumulation of the organic-carbon-rich strata imply that reducing conditions in the sediments (and therefore the increased degree of preservation of organic matter) were the result of anoxic or near-anoxic conditions in oceanic bottom waters, or in a <b>midwater</b> oxygen-minimum <b>zone.</b> Evidence from several DSDP sites in the Atlantic, however, indicate that some of these middle Cretaceous "black shale" beds may be the result of variations in rate of supply of organic matter that produced anoxia or near-anoxia within <b>midwater</b> oxygen-minimum <b>zones</b> and possibly, under extreme conditions, throughout much of the bottomwater mass. Although bottom-water anoxia may have occurred during periods of organic-carbon-rich strata, it was not necessarily the only cause for accumulation of these strata. The main reason for the accumulation of organic-carbonrich strata was an increase in the relative amount of organic debris being deposited. Some of this organic debris was derived from continental-margin areas of increased production, accumulation, and preservation of organic matter from marine, terrestrial, or mixed sources and transported to slope and basinal sites by turbidity currents...|$|R
50|$|Commercial fishing today uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for fishing. Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like cast nets, hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, surrounding nets etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, cast nets, seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic <b>zone.</b> <b>Midwater</b> trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|R
40|$|The sediments of a deep-sea hypersaline and sulfidic Mediterranean basin {{have yielded}} an {{unexpected}} discovery, the first multicellular animals living entirely without oxygen. Reported by Danovaro et al. in BMC Biology, these three {{new species of}} Loricifera add a new and remarkable dimension to anoxic ecosystems previously thought to support only unicellular life. Few environments on earth lack life in some form; microbes appear to be ubiquitous, with a presence from the atmosphere [1] to the deep subsurface ocean [2]. But extreme settings often lack multicelluar organisms. Some of the most extreme environments on earth {{can be found in}} the deep ocean. Excessively high salinities in brine pools, toxic sulfide levels within methane seep sediments, high metal concentrations in hydrothermal vent fluids, high pressures at the bottom of trenches, and anoxic sediments in isolated basins and <b>midwater</b> oxygen minimum <b>zones</b> are examples. Prokaryotic organisms (without nuclei) are known to inhabit all of these settings, and single-cell eukaryotic organisms (protozoa), most noticeably ciliates and foraminifera, are also recorded in most extreme deep-sea environments. Anoxic and dysoxic environments in particular host a reduced diversity of protozoans [3]. These protozoans have a range of adaptations that often involve symbioses [4] and the ability to store and respire nitrate, although most taxa that do this appear to be facultative anaerobes [5]. To date, however, no one has found metazoans capable of living and reproducing entirely in the absence of oxygen. This has changed with the discovery by Danovaro et al. [6] of viable loriciferans in a hypersaline, anoxic basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Loricifera are small (< 1 mm), exclusively marine meiofauna that belong to a relatively recently described marine phylum. Although there are only 22 described species, they have been recorded from a broad range of depths and settings ranging from shallow, coastal water...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Blue Planet" [...] (aired January 29, 1986) [...] - [...] The episode {{discusses}} {{major new}} revelations about the oceans. Topics covered include {{the movement of}} water in the ocean, such as ocean currents and eddy fields, and the effect of newly discovered ocean water dynamics on human activities such as yacht racing; the causes and effects of upwellings; the use of satellites to track plankton growth from space and the use of plankton maps created from such information to advise the crews of commercial fishing vessels on the best places to fish; the effect of the El Niño phenomenon on the world's weather; the discovery by scientists employing deep-sea research submersibles of previously unknown life forms living in the ocean's midwater zone; the use of sonar to make hydrographic surveys of the ocean bottom's topography; the study of cores of ocean bottom sediment to study the chemistry of, temperature of, and array of life present in the ocean in the past; and hydrothermal vents and the life that depends on them. The episode follows the first oceanographer in space, Paul Scully-Power, as he makes the first oceanographic reports ever made from space while aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger; visits the Gulf Stream, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, the waters of the Southern Ocean off Antarctica and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, the National Marine Fisheries Service's Southwest Fisheries Center in San Diego, California, the Exxon Production Research Company in Houston, Texas, and Baffin Bay; and makes dives in a bathysphere into the ocean's <b>midwater</b> <b>zone</b> and with the United States Navy research submersible Sea Cliff {{to the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|E
40|$|THE LARGE {{animals in}} the sea are almost all vertebrates: fish, turtles and whales. Only one group of {{invertebrates}} has produced creatures of comparable size and activity. These are the molluscs, {{on the face of}} it an unlikely group to have given rise to some of the ocean’s most outstanding athletes. Yet it did. The cephalopods, a class of animals that includes the squids, cuttlefish and octopuses, are indisputably molluscs. They share a common body plan with clams and snails, but are greatly modified to allow them lifestyles comparable with those of the vertebrates. Between them, the cephalopod molluscs, the fish and the toothed whales constitute a formidable assemblage of predators, eating each other and anyone else available as a source of protein in the sea. The molluscs established themselves as predators of the <b>midwater</b> <b>zone</b> before the fish. The cephalopods apparently arose from small limpet-like animals that crawled on the seabed. These primitive forerunners of today’s sophisticated predators disputed possession of the late Cambrian sea floor with a range of other animals, most of them armoured, and many, we may safely assume, predatory. What distinguished the early protocephalopod from the rest of the mob was a capacity to secrete gas into the apex of its shell...|$|E
40|$|Elk Kelp, Pelagophycus porra, is {{commonly}} observed in deep (20 - 30 m) water along {{the outer edge}} of Giant Kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, beds in southern California, USA and northern Baja California, MEX, but rarely occurs in shallower water or within beds of M. pyrifera. Due to the nature of P. porra’s heteromorphic life history that alternates between a macroscopic diploid sporophyte and a microscopic haploid gametophyte, investigations of both life history stages were needed to understand P. porra’ apparent inability to encroach into Macrocystis beds along the southern California coast. Juvenile P. porra sporophytes were transplanted (1) within the Pelagophycus zone along the offshore edge of the M. pyrifera bed at 20 m, (2) within the center of the M. pyrifera bed at 15 m and (3) along the inshore edge of the M. pyrifera bed at 8 m. Transplanted P. porra exhibited similar growth across all depths, but the onset of reproductive maturity was observed only at shallower depths. Stipe length at the onset of maturity differed between depths, increasing significantly from inshore and within the center of M. pyrifera beds to offshore within naturally occurring P. porra beds. Photosynthetic measurements of P. porra blades using PAM fluorometry indicated that although P. porra initially exhibits characteristics of a low-light adapted species (20 m depth), individuals are able to photoacclimate to increasing light levels showing traits of high-light adapted species in the <b>midwater</b> <b>zone</b> and at the surface. When the presence of P. porra propagules was increased, P. porra was unable to recruit within M. pyrifera beds. No P. porra recruits were observed near sori bags placed within M. pyrifera beds while heavy recruitment (6. 5 ± 0. 604 SE and 2. 5 ± 0. 394 S E for 1 m and 2 m away from sori bag respectively) was observed near the sori bags within the P. porra bed. These seeding experiments indicated that a factor other than spore dispersal is limiting P. porra distribution to deeper depths. Culture experiments were carried out in the laboratory using microscopic gametophytes and embryonic sporophytes of P. porra to investigate the effects of the higher light levels found within M. pyrifera beds. Cultures were grown under low light (2 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) conditions and then moved to high light conditions (16 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) at which time both embryonic sporophytes and gametophytes experienced 100 % mortality. When grown under constantly higher (18 μmol photons m- 2 s 1) light conditions, the ability of P. porra to photoacclimate decreased. The vunerability of P. porra microscopic stages to higher irradiances appears to be the major limiting factor inhibiting P. porra from becoming established within Macrocystis beds and stresses the importance of a multiple life-history approach when investigating species distributions...|$|E
40|$|The eastern {{tropical}} north Pacific (ETNP) {{is characterized}} {{by one of the}} ocean 2 ̆ 7 s most severe <b>midwater</b> oxygen minimum <b>zones</b> (OMZs), where oxygen levels are often less than 5 µM. The copepod family Eucalanidae is a numerically abundant and diverse zooplankton group in the ETNP, and displays a wide range of vertical distributions related to environmental oxygen concentrations. The goal of this dissertation was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} ecology, physiology, and biochemistry of closely related copepod species (family Eucalanidae) that inhabit the ETNP OMZ system. This was accomplished through examining different parameters relating to (1) metabolic rates, (2) detailed lipid composition and biomarkers, and (3) body composition, enzyme activity and survivorship in low oxygen water. Oxygen consumption, ammonium, urea, and phosphate excretion rates were generally highest in Subeucalanus subtenuis, a copepod primarily residing in the upper euphotic zone. Eucalanus inermis, typically found in the lowest oxygen environment of the species examined, showed significantly lower metabolic rates largely due to high water content. Rhincalanus rostrifrons, residing primarily in the upper oxycline, showed intermediate rates, likely relating to its higher reliance on lipid catabolism than S. subtenuis and E. inermis. Urea excretion rates showed a complicated relationship with temperature and oxygen, which calls for further study. Knowledge of such interactions is necessary for accurate modeling of nitrogen cycles in OMZ and other oceanic regions. Lipid biomarkers suggested that S. subtenuis, E. inermis and Pareucalanus attenuatus all fed primarily on particulates near the chlorophyll maximum region, while R. rostrifrons and R. nasutus likely fed on sinking particulates at depth. These results also emphasized the difference in lipid composition between wax esters and triacylglycerol components of storage lipids. This study suggested a much larger role of phylogeny in characterizing lipid contents than previously thought. Body composition, enzyme assays and survivorship studies suggested that E. inermis, S. subtenuis, P. attenuatus, R. nasutus and R. rostrifrons formed four separate ecological groups based on genus. E. inermis had low organic matter, moderate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and high survivorship at oxygen concentrations 3 ̆c 20 µM. Rhincalanus spp. also had moderate LDH activity and high survivorship in low oxygen, but were unique in particularly low protein and high lipid content. S. subtenuis was characterized by high protein content, no measurable LDH activity and low survivorship in 3 ̆c 20 µM O 2. P. attenuatus was similar to S. subtenuis in many respects, but had lower protein content and a different lipid accumulation strategy. In conclusion, eucalanoid copepods utilized many different ecological strategies in the ETNP OMZ system. Features of different ecological groups fit well with their observed vertical distributions in the water column. Understanding the ecology of organisms in OMZ systems will allow us better predictive capability for the effects of expanding OMZs in other regions...|$|R
