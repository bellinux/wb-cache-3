40|$|Research {{into the}} effects of ability {{grouping}} has usually been conducted within schools. In the British and North American context, where the bulk {{of this kind of}} research has been carried out, ability grouping commonly occurs within schools. In Flanders – the Dutch-speaking, northern part of Belgium – as in other European countries, there are not only tracks within schools, but schools themselves can be distinguished by the curriculum they offer. This study questions whether students’ global self-esteem is affected differently by processes of within-school tracking (<b>multilateral</b> <b>schools)</b> compared to processes of between-school tracking (categorial schools). Analyses are based on a subsample of the Flemish Educational Assessment, gathered in 2004 – 2005, encompassing 10 multilateral and 56 categorial schools with 3, 758 academic and 2, 152 vocational students. Multi-level analyses (HLM 6) show that academic students have a significant higher self-esteem than vocational students and this difference is larger in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools.</b> Academic students in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools</b> have a slightly higher self-esteem than those in categorial schools.

40|$|In this {{research}} topics of intercultural development are examined through a phenomenographical case study. The study centres around a Comenius <b>Multilateral</b> <b>School</b> Partnership Project, {{which aims to}} improve cooperation and intercultural learning between European schools. As part of the initiative to promote intercultural learning {{of children in the}} countries of the European Union, the European Commission launched a Comenius Project in 2009 - 2011 linking schools in Austria, England, Finland and Germany. The partnership of these countries actualised on multilateral and bilateral level. This study provides an analysis of the practises and learning outcomes from the Finnish perspective through a school partnership between a fifth grade class in Finland and a seventh grade class in Austria. The main focus of the study is the experiences and learning outcomes of the 22 Finnish pupils, that were participants in the Project. Research data is comprised of interviews of pupils, their parents and class teacher, pupil surveys, written narratives and observation of the researcher. Practical aspects of implementing the multi-faceted intercultural learning situations, which culminated to a 7 -day study visit as the Austrian pupils visited Finland and were hosted in homes, are addressed. Key themes of the study involve various aspects of intercultural learning, such as development of intercultural sensitivity, role of national identity, situated learning, language acquisition and curricular frameworks. These themes are approached from theoretical as well as practical viewpoints and aim to build a holistic understanding of intercultural learning in practice. The theoretical basis to intercultural matters discusses the current need for intercultural competence, a challenge posed by globalisation and its various representations. In short, the demand for international cooperation and intercultual skills has increased while the notion of global citizenship has gained ground. The postmodern concept of globalisation is covered in this study through argumentation by scholars such as Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman. An inseparable element of intercultural development, national identity is discussed based on theories of Stuart Hall. At the core of the theoretical framework, Milton Bennett’s Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity outlines the fundamental components of intercultural development setting the standard for analysis of research findings.             The most significant learning outcomes from pupils’ viewpoint are increased competence and courage to speak a foreign language as part of developed intercultural skills, and motivation to become acquainted with foreign cultures and people. Pupils also shifted in their thinking to a more accepting attitude towards cultural difference while learning to appreciate and embrace the uniqueness of their own culture. Eagerness to claim every culture as equal increased as well as understanding of global issues. Other findings suggest that teaching intercultural topics may be integrated into the objectives of the National Curriculum, although readiness to integrate and implement these topics require intercultural awareness and competence from teachers. Overall, participation in the Comenius Project was regarded a positive experience and a privilege by nearly all participants, which indicates a progressive development to the direction where the countries of European Union are encouraged. Key words: intercultural learning, intercultural sensitivity, intercultural development, national identity, global citizenship, curricular integration, situated learning...|$|E
40|$|This study {{builds on}} ongoing debates on the {{usefulness}} of Ogbu's (Ogbu, 1984; 2008; Ogbu & Simons, 1998) cultural-ecological theory by exploring the importance of various community forces in shaping educational aspirations of three different voluntary migrant groups in Flanders (Belgium). Since the first waves of labor migration to Belgium after WW II, immigrant children underachieved in school compared to their Belgian peers. As most immigrants came voluntarily to Belgium, these underachieving results conflict with Ogbu’s cultural-ecological model, in which he distinguishes between two main groups based on the shared collective history of different racial/ethnic groups. This model predicts that voluntary immigrants (such as Asian immigrants in the US) have better educational outcomes compared to the involuntary non-immigrants (such as African Americans in the US). According to Ogbu, these educational outcomes of immigrants {{are the result of}} both ‘the system’ and ‘community forces’. ‘The system’ consists out of educational policies at different levels, the treatment of minority children in school and the societal rewards that minority students receive when achieving. In addition, ‘community forces’ refer to minority community factors and exist out of the attitudes, beliefs, behaviors related to education, found in migrant communities, and these interact with ‘the system’. Community forces include the frame of reference for comparison, instrumental beliefs about schooling, a relational domain, such as perennial conflicts, the degree of trust and mistrust toward school and school personnel, the belief about the role of schooling in the subordination or oppression of the group, and finally, expressive factors, such as collective identity and cultural and language frames of reference. Ogbu's theory has not received unequivocal support when tested in non-settler countries with respect to voluntary immigrant groups because recent migrant countries have different migration histories and political and economic relations with their former colonies (Eldering, 1997; Van Zanten, 1997; Hermans, 2004; Gibson, 1997), and fails to explain within-group variations, or variations within voluntary/involuntary immigrant groups (Akom, 2008; Gibson, 1997; Matute-Bianchi, 2008). In order to test Ogbu's theory and develop a deeper understanding of why certain immigrant groups might follow or deviate from Ogbu's predictions, this study compares one community force, namely the ‘frame of reference for comparison’, that underpins the development of such aspirations within and between three different voluntary immigrant groups in the same Flemish (Belgian) city: Turkish, North-African and Eastern European secondary school students. More specific, the internal variability within the voluntary immigrant category is examined. These immigrant groups have different comparison groups as they have different migration histories, length of their stay in Belgium and the migration networks, and the utility of Ogbu’s cultural-ecological model and typology for a non-settler society is tested. Methods: This paper is based on ethnographic research conducted between 2009 - 2011 in three secondary schools in a large Flemish city: St. -Bernardus, Mountain High and Heartbreak High. St. -Bernardus is large, catholic, co-educational and <b>multilateral</b> <b>school</b> that offers professional, technical and academic tracks. Mountain High and Heartbreak High are medium-sized, non-religious co-educational and categorical schools. Mountain High only offers academic tracks and Heartbreak High only offers technical and vocational tracks. Nine class groups from fifth-grade of secondary school (with one exceptional seventh-grade) were selected, based on the field of study they followed and the presence of immigrant students. Fieldwork was conducted for two or three weeks per class group. After this intensive period of naturalistic observations and getting to know the students, teachers and school, qualitative, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were taken from the respondents of each class. Out of the sample of 124 respondents, 33 Turkish descent, 17 North-African descent and 14 Eastern European descent students are analyzed. The selected city is situated in Flanders, the Dutch linguistic community of Belgium, and known for its dense Turkish community, a more heterogeneous group of North African immigrants and a smaller group of immigrants that arrived more recently from different Eastern European countries. Results: Results indicate that although Turkish and North African students migrated voluntarily, they already reside for more than one generation in Belgium which affects students’ frame of reference for comparison and resembles the situation that Ogbu described for involuntary non-migrants. Both immigrant groups’ frame of reference differs because of the density of their immigrant community in the selected city: Turkish students have a more dense community and therefore this immigrant community serves as a frame of reference for comparison, while North African students have more heterogeneous communities and parental education is a more crucial factor for their educational strategies. In contrast, due to their different migration history, Eastern European students’ frame of reference for comparison are similar to the voluntary immigrants from Ogbu’s typology, as these students migrated during their school career and have lived in their country of origin for some years. The findings suggest that Ogbu’s theory offers an interesting framework but fails to consider the importance of particular determining factors, such as the migration histories, migrant networks and length of stay, in order to explain the observed differences between these three voluntary groups and further refine Ogbu’s theory.
