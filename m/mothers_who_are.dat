5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

25|$|Some legal {{scholars}} and feminist writers have accused the fathers' rights movement {{of putting the}} interests of fathers above the interests of children, for example, by suggesting that it is acceptable for fathers to withdraw child support {{if they are not}} given access to their children, or by lobbying for changes in family law that would allegedly heighten children's exposure to abusive fathers, and would allegedly further endanger <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggestion}} {{was brought to}} widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime, authored by the economists Steven D. Levitt and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime {{to a reduction in}} individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> African American, impoverished, adolescent, uneducated, and single. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of Roe v. Wade and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before {{the rest of the nation}} experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.|$|E

An attempt by the city to raise property taxes in November 2006 was defeated by voters, which led to cuts in the hours of the library. The library received a grant in 2008 to expand its out-reach program at the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, a women’s prison in Wilsonville. The $10,000 grant allowed for additional training and books for the program, entitled Book Bridges, designed to build and strength the connection between infants and their <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> serving time in prison.

25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to <b>mothers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

2500|$|Identification of {{patients}} presymptomatically via newborn screening has allowed early intervention and treatment.

[...] <b>Mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> identified after a positive newborn screen but are otherwise asymptomatic are typically offered carnitine supplementation as well.

2500|$|Born in 1066 in Dijon, Duchy of Burgundy, Count Henry was the {{youngest}} son of Henry, the second son of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. His two older brothers, Hugh I and Odo, inherited the duchy. [...] No contemporary record of his mother has survived. [...] She was once {{thought to have been}} named Sibylla based on an undated obituary reporting the death of [...] "Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie" [...] (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy), under the reasoning that she was not called duchess herself and hence must have been the wife of Henry, the only father of a duke who never himself held the ducal title, yet this was probably a reference to her daughter-in-law, Sibylla, mother of the then-reigning Hugh II. [...] Richard suggested that she might instead have been called Clémence. [...] Whatever her name, her son Henry was kinsman (congermanus) of his brother-in-law, Raymond of Burgundy, and this relationship may have come through either, or both, of their <b>mothers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> both of undocumented parentage. [...] It has been suggested that Henry's mother may have been the daughter of Reginald I, which would make her the maternal aunt of Raymond who would then be Henry’s first cousin. [...] This solution is problematic, as Henry's brother Odo I, Duke of Burgundy married Raymond's sister, Sibylla, and though marriages between close kin sometimes took place through dispensation, the prohibition against first-cousin marriages in church law makes it likely that the relationship between Odo and Sibylla, and hence that between Henry and Raymond, was more distant. [...] Based on the relationship between Henry and Raymond and the apparent introduction of the byname Borel into the family of the Dukes of Burgundy through this marriage, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay suggested Henry's mother was daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, and his wife Guisla de Lluçà.|$|E
2500|$|Many policy analysts {{consider}} literacy {{rates as}} a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made {{on the grounds that}} literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education. Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is {{one of the keys to}} success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. [...] "For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition," [...] says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. [...] "Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner." ...|$|E

6000|$|Take {{the faith}} in its utmost terms. When {{the captain of the}} 'London' shook hands with his mate, saying 'God speed you! I will go down with my passengers,' that I believe to be 'human nature.' He does not do it from any {{religious}} motive--from any hope of reward, or any fear of punishment; he does it because he is a man. But when a mother, living among the fair fields of merry England, gives her two-year-old child to be suffocated under a mattress in her inner room, while the said mother waits and talks outside; that I believe to be not human nature. You have the two extremes there, shortly. And you, men, and <b>mothers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> here face to face with me to-night, I call upon you to say which of these is human, and which inhuman--which 'natural' and which 'unnatural?'

Which of them has failed from their nature--from their present, possible, actual nature;--not their nature of long ago, but their nature of now? Which has betrayed it--falsified it? Did the guardian who died in his trust, die inhumanly, and as a fool; and did the murderess of her child fulfil the law of her being? Choose, I say; infinitude of choices hang upon this. You have had false prophets among you--for centuries you have had them--solemnly warned against them though you were; false prophets, who have told you that all men are nothing but fiends or wolves, half beast, half devil. Believe that and indeed you may sink to that. But refuse that, and have faith that God 'made you upright,' though you have sought out many inventions; so, you will strive daily to become more what your Maker meant and means you to be, and daily gives you also the power to be--and you will cling more and more to the nobleness and virtue that is in you, saying, 'My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go.' ...|$|E
