50|$|Phoenix College is {{a special}} school in Reading, Berkshire. The school is for {{children}} who have been permanently excluded from <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Phoenix currently offers 56 places for students (young men) aged between 11 and 16 years (secondary provision). There is no residential provision. Students whose main special needs and barrier to learning are Emotional, Behavioural and Social disorders (EBSD). All have a statement of SEN or {{are in the process of}} being statemented. Most have been permanently excluded, at least once, from <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> and a few from other special schools. In the current climate of the need to reduce exclusion numbers, Phoenix works cooperatively with the Borough to promote speedy managed moves for those students who are in ‘danger of permanent exclusion’ from <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools,</b> or whose assessments, whilst in a PRU, show that a return to <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling</b> is not appropriate.|$|R

500|$|As of 2010, Pathlight School had an {{enrolment}} of {{over 500}} students, of whom about 40% had their school fees of S$500 subsidised. The school caters {{to students with}} autism aged six to 18, {{who are able to}} access the mainstream curriculum because they are high-functioning, but would have difficulty learning in a <b>mainstream</b> <b>school.</b> Most students take mainstream national examinations, such as the PSLE and O Levels, with results comparable to students from mainstream schools, and some enter mainstream tertiary institutions. About 10% of students take a vocational track and may transfer to Eden School, which caters to lower-functioning autistic children and focuses on vocational training. [...] Students from Pathlight School have participated in—and won—national competitions such as the National Youth Business Challenge 2010.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mainstream</b> <b>school</b> of Bitchū Province was the Aoe school {{named after}} a place {{presently}} located in Kurashiki. It appeared {{at the end of}} the Heian period and thrived in the ensuing Kamakura period. The quality of Aoe swords was swiftly recognized, as 3 of the 12 smiths at Emperor Go-Toba's court were of this school. Five tachi blades of the early aoe school (ko-aoe, before the Ryakunin era, 1238/39) have been designated national treasures. The ko-aoe school consists of two families employing a similar style of swordsmanship that did not deviate with time. The first family was represented by the founder Yasutsugu and, among others, Sadatsugu, Tametsugu, Yasutsugu (the one in this list) and Moritoshi. The second family, named [...] "Senoo", was founded by Noritake who was followed by Masatsune, and others. Ko-Aoe produced slender tachi with small kissaki and deep koshi-zori. A distinctive feature of this school is the jihada which is chirimen-hada and sumigane (dark and plain steel). The hamon is midare based on suguha with ashi and yō. The boshi is midare komi or suguha with a short kaeri, yakitsume.|$|E
2500|$|In Singapore, madrasahs {{are private}} schools which are overseen by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS, Islamic Religious Council of Singapore). There are six Madrasahs in Singapore, {{catering}} to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or [...] "Pre-U", at several schools). Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take {{a range of}} Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the [...] "Joint Madrasah System" [...] (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ukhrawi, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a <b>mainstream</b> <b>school,</b> they may opt to take classes on weekends at the madrasah instead of enrolling full-time.|$|E

40|$|The main {{assertion}} in this dissertation is {{that there}} is a lack of adequate and appropriate parental involvement in the education of learners with mild intellectual impairment in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> in Sisonke District. Empirical research was conducted to understand the perceptions of parents and teachers of the involvement of parents in the education of learners with mild intellectual impairment in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> The focus was on parents and teachers in an extreme poverty context in Sisonke District of KwaZulu-Natal. A qualitative investigation of parental involvement in five <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> was conducted by collecting data through interview, observation and documents analysis with ten parents and five teachers. The literature that was reviewed focused on the factors that increase and hinder parental involvement, prevalence of intellectual impairment, theories related to family, school and community partnership and inclusive education. The research has revealed that the lack of adequate and appropriate parental involvement at <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> admitting learners with mild intellectual impairment is influenced by factors such as poor socio-economic background, high illiteracy, cultural beliefs, and parents’ denial of intellectual impairment, diversity, lack of teacher training in parental involvement, lack of healthy inclusive climate characteristics, parents’ attitudes and perceptions. The investigation further found that there is an urgent need for teachers to acquire knowledge, skills and strategies for active involvement of parents in inclusive <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Each School Management Team (SMT) should strive to create a climate of inclusion that displays healthy school characteristics in order to improve parental involvement in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Inclusive EducationM.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a multi-method study {{of the ways in}} which special and <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> support the {{educational}} needs of children with disabilities in Fiji. The aims of the study were: (1) to identify capacity and functions of special schools to support inclusive <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> for children with disabilities, and; (2) to explore the capacity of <b>mainstream</b> disability-inclusive <b>schools</b> in meeting the needs of children with disabilities. Results from the special education survey indicated that type of disability, geographical location and controlling authority were associated with transition to mainstream education. Findings from the action research study suggest that supportive school leadership and positive attitudes towards disability and inclusion contribute to greater mobilisation of supporting resources. However, limitations in facilities and resources currently pose barriers which prevent inclusion for all students with disabilities. Together, these findings indicate that special and inclusive <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> jointly support disability-inclusive education in Fiji...|$|R

40|$|Arguments {{supporting}} {{the integration of}} deaf pupils in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> are often based on possible cognitive gains, {{but it has been}} suggested that integration should also be assessed in terms of its social consequences for pupils. If deaf pupils are rejected or feel isolated in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools,</b> their education may ultimately suffer. We investigated the social adaptation of nine deaf pupils in two <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> using three methods: peer ratings, sociometric status and interviews. The average peer ratings received by deaf pupils were not significantly different from those of hearing pupils. Thus these deaf pupils were not more disliked by their peers. However, they were significantly more likely to be neglected by their peers and less likely to have a friend in the classroom. Hearing pupils who were friends of deaf pupils described their friendship as involving pro-social functions whereas many who had no deaf friends found communication an obstacle to friendship. We conclude that, although deaf pupils are not rejected in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools,</b> they may feel isolated. It is possible that schools can have a proactive role in helping hearing pupils learn how to overcome communication barriers and develop more positive attitudes towards deaf pupils...|$|R
