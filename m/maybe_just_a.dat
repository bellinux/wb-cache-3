2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little too blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have {{also said that the}} slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E
2500|$|Here I Am {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on sixteen reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman gave Here I Am {{four out of}} five stars and complimented its [...] appeal to [...] "hip-hop and R" [...] radio, adding that [...] "Although very eclectic taste is required to appreciate in full, this is clearly Rowland's brightest, most confident album yet." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Adam Markovitz gave Here I Am a B rating and called it [...] "a solid if unambitious set of medium-hot finger snappers." [...] Simon Gage from the Daily Express called Here I Am a [...] "jumping" [...] collection of up-tempo songs comparable to Donna Summer, but [...] "broadly much tougher and <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> tad over-processed." [...] Gage added that Rowland could include Here I Am amongst her other career highlights such as her singles [...] "Work" [...] (2008) and [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] (2009 collaboration with David Guetta), as well as her judging role on series 8 of The X Factor (UK). The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski called Here I Am a declaration of Rowland's liberation. Rytlewski attributed the album's appeal to the producers, who he felt [...] "drove forward the sound" [...] and prevented Rowland from taking [...] "songs too seriously" [...] as done on Simply Deep. He concluded his review by also praising Rowland's choice to include elements of dance music. Elyssa Garnder from USA Today gave the album a mixed review, stating that [...] "Rowland traverses the gamut of predictable romantic scenarios prettily enough... alas, Here I Am proves a lot more cautious than that dare suggests." [...] Jon Caramanica from the New York Times called the album both smart and surprising. [...] "Here I Am is something much more confident and more surprising [...] It's a chewy and moody R album on which Ms. Rowland sounds assured and vital. Or, at minimum, is made to sound that way... Her vocals are stacked thick and placed loud in the mix, but while they're noticeable, they're not particularly notable apart from their arrangements." ...|$|E
