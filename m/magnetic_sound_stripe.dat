5000|$|Digital {{scanners}} [...] {{can capture}} images {{as large as}} 65mm in full resolution. That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used {{a portion of the}} film surface for its multitrack <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>stripe.</b> A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film [...] ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.|$|E
50|$|Although {{never as}} popular internationally as Super 8, the format {{continued}} to live in parallel. As of early 2007, Fuji still manufactures two versions of Single-8 film. Fujichrome R25N is Daylight Balanced Filmstock, while Fujichrome RT200N is Tungsten Balanced(3400K) for indoor filming. The Sound Film brand is no longer made, although a <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>stripe</b> {{can be added to}} the film after processing. This option is chosen whenever sending the exposed film to Fuji in Japan. In addition to Fuji's own film, black and white film is available from Japanese company Retro Enterprises. This Single-8 black & white reversal film, named Retro X, is of ASA/ISO 200 and is manufactured in Germany.|$|E

5000|$|CS perfs: In 1953, the {{introduction}} of CinemaScope by Fox Studios required {{the creation of a}} different shape of perforation which was nearly square and smaller to provide space for four <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>stripes</b> for stereophonic and surround sound. These perfs are commonly referred to as CinemaScope (CS) or [...] "Fox hole" [...] perfs. Their dimensions are 0.0780 in (1.85 mm) in width by 0.0730" [...] (1.98 mm) in height. Due to the size difference, CS perfed film cannot be run through a projector with standard KS sprocket teeth, but KS prints can be run on sprockets with CS teeth. Shrunken film with KS prints that would normally be damaged in a projector with KS sprockets may sometimes be run far more gently through a projector with CS sprockets because of the smaller size of the teeth. Magnetic striped 35 mm film became obsolete in the 1980s after the advent of Dolby Stereo, as a result film with CS perfs is no longer manufactured.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Bender {{received}} an Academy Award for Scientific/Technical Achievement {{for the development}} of the Advanced Data Encoding System (ADE), a technology designed to bridge the gap between linear film editing and non-linear sound editing. ADE represented a significant leap ahead in post-production. The system created a computerized edit decision list from the picture editor’s workprint, which reduced the time and effort required to find the right sound take for the picture. Prior to ADE, sound editors would laboriously match a specific take of dialogue with the picture using a film code number and a code book containing the sound roll, scene and take number. The ADE matched an Apple computer with a modified audio film stock, which carried the traditional dialogue and <b>sound</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe,</b> plus a narrower stripe loaded with a SMPTE time code — the industry standard for tracking film or sound — and computer data.|$|R
50|$|Under Freedman's direction, innovations, {{including}} the processing and <b>sound</b> <b>striping</b> of Cinemascope, were developed and implemented. Many {{of those were}} patented and/or received Academy awards.|$|R

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> is {{no longer}} used in {{commercial}} cinema, but between 1952 and the early 1990s it provided the highest fidelity sound from film because of its wider frequency range and superior {{signal to noise ratio}} compared to optical sound. There are two forms of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> in conjunction with projection: double-head and striped.|$|R

50|$|Work is {{currently}} underway to install 70 mm projection equipment, {{as well as}} Dolby Digital, DTS, and 6-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{synchronised}} film soundtrack, optical and <b>magnetic.</b> Optical <b>sound</b> tracks are visual renditions of sound wave forms and provide sound through a light beam and optical sensor within the projector. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> tracks are essentially the same as used in conventional analog tape recording.|$|R
50|$|Although CinemaScope {{was capable}} of {{producing}} a 2.66:1 image, the addition of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> tracks for multi-channel sound reduced this to 2.55:1.|$|R
50|$|A special {{screening}} in September 1996 of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi in 70mm and six-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> {{marked the}} end of the Odeon as a single-screen cinema.|$|R
50|$|Variable-density's {{fate was}} then sealed as these stereo optical sound prints (as contrasted with stereo <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> prints or mono optical sound prints) became a {{marketing}} imperative.|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by Cinerama, {{the movie}} {{industry}} moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, Todd-AO, was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> tracks, for their screen presentation of [...] "Oklahoma!". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed {{to create their own}} unique formats, such as Warner Bros. Panavision, Paramount Pictures' VistaVision and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation's CinemaScope, the latter of which used up to four separate <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> tracks.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{magnetic}} audio was {{of excellent}} quality {{it also had}} significant disadvantages. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> prints were expensive, 35mm magnetic prints cost roughly {{twice as much as}} optical sound prints, whilst 70mm prints could cost up to 15 times as much. Furthermore, they wore out faster and were also prone to damage and erasure over time. Because of the high cost of installing <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> reproduction equipment only a minority of movie theaters ever installed it and the magnetic soundheads needed considerable maintenance to keep their performance up to standard. As a consequence the use of the Cinemascope 35mm four-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> format decreased significantly {{during the course of the}} 1960s and effectively ended with the success of the Dolby Stereo optical stereo format in the late 1970s. However 70mm film continued to be used for prestigious [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings until the introduction of digital sound on 35mm film in the early 1990s removed one of the major justifications for using this expensive format.|$|R
50|$|This 4-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> {{system was}} also used for some non-CinemaScope films; for example Fantasia was re-released in 1956, 1963, and 1969 with the {{original}} Fantasound track transferred to 4-track magnetic.|$|R
50|$|During {{the silent}} era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square 1:1, {{all the way}} up to the extreme {{widescreen}} 4:1 Polyvision. However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33). The introduction of sound-on-film briefly narrowed the aspect ratio, to allow room for a <b>sound</b> <b>stripe.</b> In 1932, a new standard was introduced, the Academy ratio of 1.37, by means of thickening the frame line.|$|R

50|$|The {{film was}} one of the first to employ the then-new Western Electric <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> {{recording}} system, which would become commonplace by 1953 and which was a necessity for stereo sound recording and reproduction.|$|R
50|$|Super 8mm {{was also}} {{specified}} with an optical sound track. This occupied {{the same location}} as the magnetic track. Picture to sound separation in this format was 22 frames. Projectors and cameras obviously could not record sound in this system, but optical sound package movies became briefly popular, particularly in Europe (mainly because they were cheaper to produce - though the projectors cost more). Although the optical sound should have been inferior in quality to <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> (running at 3.6 inches per second for 24 frames per second), in practice it was often much better, largely because packaged movie <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> was often poorly recorded.|$|R
50|$|Steenbeck is {{a company}} that {{manufactures}} flatbed editors. Steenbeck is brand name that has become synonymous with a type of flatbed film editing suite which is usable with both 16 mm and 35 mm optical <b>sound</b> and <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> film.|$|R
50|$|The Todd-AO format was {{introduced}} in 1955 and included multi-channel <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> from the start, {{it does not have}} an optical soundtrack (although in recent years some 70mm prints have used a DTS digital track in place of the analogue magnetic one).|$|R
50|$|On certain {{stocks of}} Super 8 and 16 mm an iron-oxide sound {{recording}} strip was added for the direct synchronous recording of sound which {{could then be}} played by projectors with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> head. It has since been discontinued by Kodak on both gauges.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} erroneously {{reported}} {{that there is one}} 35mm Technicolor dye-transfer print, with 4-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound,</b> in the UCLA archive library. This print has apparently had at least two presentations at university-sponsored festivals, and which presentations required special permission from the Gershwin Estate. However, UCLA archive director Jan-Christopher Horak has disputed this, saying they have no such copy. It was long believed that there are no surviving 70mm prints, and that the 65mm negative is [...] "unprintable". Likely, any restoration would have to be effected from the silver separation protection masters, assuming those could be found. A faded 70mm print with faulty 6-track <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> and with German subtitles was recently discovered and was lately screened for the opening of the 22. International Film Festival Innsbruck.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic soundtracks can {{be joined}} with the moving image but it creates an abrupt {{discontinuity}} because of the offset of the audio track relative to the picture. Whether optical or magnetic, the audio pickup must be located several inches ahead of the projection lamp, shutter and drive sprockets. There is usually a flywheel as well to smooth out the film motion to eliminate the flutter that would otherwise result from the negative pulldown mechanism. If you have films with a magnetic track, you should keep them away from strong magnetic sources, such as televisions. These can weaken or wipe the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> signal. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> on a cellulose acetate film base is also more prone to vinegar syndrome than a film with just the image.|$|R
