5000|$|By 1860 it was {{apparent}} that a civil war was inevitable. Pearson was a supporter of Southern rights and believed in protecting those rights. He visited Charleston, South Carolina where he became emotionally stirred by the Southern [...] "fire-eaters." [...] It was here that he purchased 125 smoothbore muskets, and 100 colt revolvers. He returned to Florida and asked Governor <b>Madison</b> <b>S.</b> Perry for permission to start a militia under his command. [...] At Camp McCarthy {{on the banks of the}} Ocklawaha River in Putnam County Pearson was elected Captain on May 14, 1862. On the first day 71 men enlisted in the militia but by the end of the war it increased to 150. Pearson outfitted his men with the equipment purchased from Charleston. In Orange Springs Pearson and his associates manufactured guns, cannons and munitions that were later used in the defense of Tampa. His machine shop in Orange Springs was used for the production of a patented cotton gin.|$|E

The Secession Convention met on January 3, 1861, in Tallahassee, and produced for adoption on January 10 an Ordinance of Secession and a Constitution which largely altered the existing Constitution by substituting [...] "Confederate States" [...] for [...] "United States" [...] and by declaring Florida to be [...] "a sovereign and independent nation." [...] John C.

Transport was by steamboat {{from there}} to Columbus, Georgia where it arrived on June 16, 1862. From Columbus, they would take the cars to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Lieutenant James Hayes of Company D wrote that, [...] "After we left Columbus, nearly every house we passed they were out with their handkerchiefs waving and hollering, throwing bocaiessic and apples into the cars as we would pass by. From Atlanta to this place beat all [...] [...] [...] They were perfect swarms of young ladies standing {{on the road with}} their flags flying." [...] Lieutenant Hugh Black of Company A found the journey from Columbus to Chattanooga somewhat less enjoyable; he would write to his wife that, [...] "the car that myself and the remainder of our company was in ran off the track and very near crushing the whole concern to attoms." [...] Arriving at Chattanooga on June 18, the 6th Florida was immediately ordered to report temporarily to General Danville Leadbetter, who had planned an expedition across the Tennessee River at Shell Mound.
