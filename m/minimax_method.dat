50|$|By adding clones, the Condorcet winner B1 becomes defeated. All three clones beat {{each other}} in clear defeats. A {{benefits}} from that.

50|$|Result: L loses {{against all}} other {{candidates}} and, thus, is Condorcet loser. However, the candidates A, B and C form a cycle with clear defeats.

50|$|The {{development}} of mainframe and then personal computers, {{in the final}} quarter of the twentieth century, permitted the rapid {{development of}} numerical processing techniques.

Overviews of the software developments in the field of synthesis have been given in Taylor & Huang and Kuo.|$|E
50|$|Hervé Moulin {{showed in}} 1988 that {{whenever}} {{there are at}} least 4 candidates and at least 25 voters, no resolute (single-valued) Condorcet consistent voting rule satisfies the participation criterion. However, when there are at most 3 candidates, the <b>minimax</b> <b>method</b> (with some fixed tie-breaking) satisfies both the Condorcet and the participation criterion. Similarly, when there are 4 candidates and at most 11 voters, there is a voting rule that satisfies both criteria, but no such rule exists for 4 candidates and 12 voters. Similar incompatibilities have also been proven for set-valued voting rules.|$|E
50|$|Émile Borel and John von Neumann had the {{fundamental}} and surprising insight that probability {{provides a way}} out of this conundrum. Instead of deciding on a definite action to take, the two players assign probabilities to their respective actions, and then use a random device which, according to these probabilities, chooses an action for them. Each player computes the probabilities so as to minimize the maximum expected point-loss independent of the opponent's strategy. This leads to a linear programming problem with the optimal strategies for each player. This <b>minimax</b> <b>method</b> can compute provably optimal strategies for all two-player zero-sum games.|$|E
