5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class {{and away from the}} Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

By 1983, maintenance of all of NY258 west of NY36 had been transferred to Livingston County, leading to the truncation of the route to NY36 in the mid-1990s.|$|E

25|$|Douglas was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{assembly}} plant for parts imported from Piaggio; {{many of the}} models made by Douglas had {{a high percentage of}} content manufactured by Douglas (eg cylinder heads, gear clusters, brake drums and other mechanical parts) or by UK supply companies (eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).|$|E
25|$|Abolitionists also {{attacked}} slavery as {{a threat}} to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom as <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, rights to own property, and to control one's own labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.|$|E
25|$|Merovingian {{art is the}} art and {{architecture}} of the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks, which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day France and Germany. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul during the fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, {{there was no longer}} the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> technique for the ornamentation of sarcophagi, altars, and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of gold work and manuscript illumination brought about a resurgence of Celtic decoration, which, with Christian and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art. The unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from Roman basilicas. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the Normans {{at the time of their}} incursions.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{stumbling}} block was thatdespite being a fully compliant MS-DOS systemit was not {{compatible with the}} IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as anything <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with {{their counterparts in the}} IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.|$|E
25|$|Doughty {{wrote that}} Fuller {{had called the}} {{advanced}} forces of the German army an armoured battering-ram, covered by Luftwaffe fighters and dive-bombers acting as flying field artillery, to break through a continuous front at several points. The XIX, XLI and XV panzer corps had operated as the leading force through the Ardennes but the most effective Allied resistance {{to the south and}} south-west of Sedan was reduced by the combined operations of infantry, tanks and artillery, a fact overlooked for long after 1940. Luftwaffe bombers had not acted as flying artillery and their main effect was on 13 May, when bombing collapsed the morale of the 55th Division. Air attacks helped the ground forces to advance but destroyed few tanks and bunkers, most of which were taken by the skill and determination of German infantry, sometimes helped by the fire of anti-tank guns, accompanying guns and a few tanks. Fuller's writing was in the vein of much of the early reports of the Battle of France but since then new studies had added nuance, dwelling on the complications and chaos of the military operations. The Manstein Plan led to much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> tank rush through the Ardennes and the fields of northern France; the toughness and training of the German infantry should be recognised, along with the efforts of the engineers and artillery, which got the XIX Panzer Corps across the Meuse.|$|E

[...] They also named the googly delivery a [...] "Bosie". However, this may have been <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> shortening of his name. According to Parkinson, it may have referred to the nickname ("Bosey") of Lord Alfred Douglas who was widely known to have had a homosexual affair, a criminal act at the time, with Oscar Wilde. This remained a topical subject, and the source of humour, in Australia. Parkinson suggests that the anonymous originator of the name [...] "Bosie" [...] for the googly must have been aware of the association. He also notes that the other common term in Australia for the googly was [...] "wrong 'un", which was slang for both [...] "criminal" [...] and [...] "homosexual". Parkinson suggests that these two terms for the googly, the nickname [...] "Elsie", were attempts to [...] "label the whole English ruling class as effete".|$|E

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five.

500|$|Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer was {{critical}} of Batgirl's characterization, calling it a [...] "bland, no-frills reading of the character, to be frank, which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance." [...] Wilson also lamented that the emphasis on Batgirl's hacking abilities proved to be no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> extension of Arkham Knights remote hacking environmental puzzles. She offered words similar to Stapleton's on how the lack of additional challenge maps confines the Batgirl character model to only the DLC. Wilson was skeptical {{as to whether the}} future season pass DLC would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety. Carter gave the DLC a 6.5 out of 10, reacting positively to the confinement to the [...] "good bits" [...] of Arkham Knight, more specifically the lack of the Batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle-solving - he also compared it favorably to the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews. In contrast to Stapleton, Carter felt that not many of the environments were particularly memorable, and also felt the length was sufficient compared to the game's previous story packs. Carter pointed out that a benefit to the game would be a free-roaming option involving the downloadable characters. Meanwhile, Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the DLC should have been provided free of charge, remarking on the campaign's shortness and calling it [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "lackluster". He also criticized Warner Bros. for their marketing campaign with Arkham Knight and its DLC, commenting on their sacrificing quality over quantity to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content.|$|E
