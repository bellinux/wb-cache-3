5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and <b>MOSFETs</b> for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power <b>MOSFETs</b> and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial <b>MOSFETs</b> rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
25|$|Power <b>MOSFETs</b> with lateral {{structure}} {{are mainly}} used in high-end audio amplifiers and high-power PA systems. Their advantage {{is a better}} behaviour in the saturated region (corresponding to the linear region of a bipolar transistor) than the vertical <b>MOSFETs.</b> Vertical <b>MOSFETs</b> are designed for switching applications.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, <b>MOSFETs</b> {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the <b>MOSFETs</b> used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, <b>MOSFETs</b> can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, <b>MOSFETs</b> sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, <b>MOSFETs</b> can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of <b>MOSFETs.</b> This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. <b>MOSFETS</b> are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

25|$|For {{devices of}} equal current driving capability, {{n-channel}} <b>MOSFETs</b> {{can be made}} smaller than p-channel <b>MOSFETs,</b> due to p-channel charge carriers (holes) having lower mobility than do n-channel charge carriers (electrons), and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler. These were the driving principles {{in the design of}} NMOS logic which uses n-channel <b>MOSFETs</b> exclusively. However, neglecting leakage current, unlike CMOS logic, NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place.

25|$|Process variations: With <b>MOSFETs</b> {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example <b>MOSFETs</b> actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit.

25|$|The {{on-state}} {{forward voltage}} drop in IGBTs behaves very differently from power <b>MOSFETS.</b> The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically {{of the order of}} 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power <b>MOSFETS</b> will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — With {{the race}} towards highest efficiency, {{innovative}} topologies {{are more often}} considered {{for the development of}} new power conversion products. A device with the low ON state voltage of an IGBT and the fast switching characteristics of a <b>MOSFET</b> can be achieved by paralleling an IGBT with a <b>MOSFET.</b> However, in order to gain these advantages, the IGBT <b>MOSFET</b> pair must be carefully controlled. At switch on the Gate of the <b>MOSFET</b> is direct paralleled with the IGBT gate because the <b>MOSFET</b> will be faster and take over the switch on losses. But at switch off, the <b>MOSFET</b> has to be delayed to release the IGBT from switch off losses. For this timing there are different possibilities available like single gate connection and separate gate connections. <b>MOSFET</b> connected in parallel with IGBT can create soft switching condition for IGBT. Also with the paralleling of <b>MOSFET</b> and IGBT, it is possible to achieve a nearly constant efficiency at the highest level. ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{thyristors}} {{are heavily}} used in megawatt-scale rectification of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually {{been replaced by}} other devices with superior switching characteristics like Power <b>MOSFETs</b> or IGBTs. One major problem associated with SCRs {{is that they are}} not fully controllable switches. The GTO thyristor and IGCT are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. <b>MOSFETs,</b> on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only majority carriers carry the current).|$|E
25|$|Some ICs combine analog {{and digital}} MOSFET {{circuitry}} {{on a single}} mixed-signal integrated circuit, making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading {{to the use of}} isolation rings and silicon on insulator (SOI). Since <b>MOSFETs</b> require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and <b>MOSFETs</b> into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called Bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and BiCMOS (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.|$|E

25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel <b>MOSFETs</b> as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both <b>MOSFETs</b> will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
25|$|The IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) is {{a device}} for power control. It has a {{structure}} {{akin to a}} MOSFET coupled with a bipolar-like main conduction channel.

25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of <b>MOSFETs</b> for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the <b>MOSFETs</b> decreases.|$|E
