The objective {{of this study was}} to design a manual device for use in the clinical setting. Manual {{measurement of}} spastic ankle joint stiffness has historically been conducted using hand-held dynamometers or alternative devices, but some difficulties have been reported in controlling the velocity applied to the ankle during the measurement. In this study, a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>device</b> was constructed with a footplate, a torquemeter and a potentiometer. It was mechanically designed to rotate around an approximated axis of the ankle joint and to measure ankle joint angular position and its corresponding resistive torque. Two stroke hemiplegic subjects pariticapted in a pilot study.

Moreover, the results demonstrated that the device could potentially apply a wide range of angular velocities and provide potentially useful clinical information. Quantitative data successfully acquired using this method included the approximate ankle angular position, where the velocity-dependent characteristics of stiffness was notably initiated and its corresponding torque and velocity.

Hockman at NlST (ASTM 2000, C 719 93) (the so-called Hockman cycle). Specimens are rated visually for cohesive or adhesive failure. Studies on {{the correlation of}} long-term artificial aging and outdoor exposure of sealants {{that focused on the}} degradation of cohesive properties and surface appearance were reviewed by Wolf (1999). Several devices have been used to induce cyclic movement (fatigue) of sealants during exposure. These devices generally use thermally induced dimensional change to generate fatigue in a sealant.

40|$|The usual type of {{altimeter}} {{contains a}} pressure element, the deflections {{of which are}} approximately proportional to pressure changes. An evenly divided altitude scale is secured by using a mechanism between the pressure element and pointer which gives the required motion of the pointer. A temperature-compensated altimeter was constructed at the Bureau of Standards for the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Navy Department which contained a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>device</b> for controlling the multiplication of the mechanism {{to the extent necessary}} for temperature compensation. The introduction of this device made it difficult to adjust the multiplying mechanism to fit an evenly divided altitude scale.

The element consisted of a metal bellows of the sylphon type coupled to an internal helical spring which was designed so as to have a variable number of active coils. This report presents a description of and laboratory data relating to the special pressure element for the altimeter. In addition equations which apply generally to springs and pressure elements of constant logarithmic stiffness are developed, including the deflection and the spacing between the coils in terms of the constants of the helical spring and pressure elements.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported in this thesis was to improve the understanding of footwear and soft ground interaction and, in particular, its mathematical modelling. The work was undertaken for the Military Footwear Section of the MOD's Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency (DCTA) who funded {{the research}} in conjunction with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSERC). Although research has been carried out on the interaction of footwear on firm surfaces, minimal work has previously been carried out on softer surfaces often encountered in combat situations and little effort has been applied to its mathematical modelling. The research programme included the development of mathematical models using soil mechanics theory, and experimental work using a soft-ground slip-rig. The prototype soft-ground footwear slip-rig that has been developed is a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>device</b> based on simple mechanical mechanisms using weights and pulleys. The rig enables the measurement of traction and sinkage for different soil types, sole materials and tread geometry, at various angles of heel contact and applied vertical load. All experimental work has been carried out with the use of scaled up cleats to obtain measurable results. An investigation into three dimensional end effects has determined at what cleat length the problem becomes two dimensional. The experimental results have shown the effects of cleat geometry on total cleat traction for sand, and in particular the geometric characteristics that promote and reduce traction. These results have been analysed using Taguchi's Analysis of Variance technique. Traction distribution experiments have determined the proportion of traction obtained from different cleat areas. Soil mechanics theory, and in particular Coulomb's retaining wall theory, has been applied in the theoretical modelling of footwear and soft ground interaction. A two dimensional total traction model has been developed using MATLAB software and experimental and theoretical results have been compared. The traction versus cleat geometry trends for both the experimental and theoretical results were in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to produce a fully {{automated}} prototype system {{for the treatment of}} premature babies who are suffering from renal failure or metabolic disorders. These patients are difficult or impossible to treat conventionally, due to their very small total blood volume and their intolerance to donated blood. There was a strong case for developing a dialysis system specifically designed for the treatment of such patients. The system is based on a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>device</b> developed at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne. It differs from conventional dialysis methods in several ways. Blood access to the patient is via a single venous catheter. Only a very small amount of blood is needed to prime the extracorporeal circuit - this can be as little as 6. 8 ml in the smallest patients. This compares very favourably with the volumes needed in conventional circuits, which are in the range of 15 - 40 ml. This small priming volume means that donated blood is not needed to prime the circuit. The clearance and ultrafiltration rates that can be achieved are independent of the rate that blood can be accessed from the patient, since the same blood passes back and forth through the haemofilter several times. The clearances that have been obtained experimentally are consistently above 40 % of the mean blood flow rate through the system. The largest mean blood flow rate available is 5 ml/min, so the maximum clearance is approximately 2 ml/min. The maximum ultrafiltration rate that can be obtained is 50 ml/h. The new system is more effective at treating premature babies than conventional dialysis circuits. The hand driven system was tested in vivo and found to work well, so the automated system was developed on a solid foundation. A prototype system has been successfully developed and tested. This thesis details both the development and the testing. The new system uses stepper motors and DC servo motors for actuation, and is controlled by Labwindows/CVI and NIDAQ software running on a standard PC platform. The interface between the PC and the machine is provided by a National Instruments data acquisition board. A comprehensive single fault analysis of the safety of the system was undertaken, including both software and hardware. In vitro testing covered several areas of operation. The accuracy of the ultrafiltration process was established. The clearance rates that could be achieved were determined. The amount of damage caused to the blood by the system was also tested. This was found to be well within acceptable clinical limits. In vivo testing established the feasibility of using a computer algorithm to control the withdrawal of blood from the patient. Finally, the system was successfully used to treat a patient with an in-born metabolic disorder. In summary, a new system has been developed that is superior to any other treatment method currently available for neonates with these types of disorders...|$|E

40|$|The {{forestry}} {{sector in}} New Zealand {{ranks as the}} third largest export earner. The individual industries within the forestry sector have, in some cases, grown up {{on the basis of}} institutionalised knowledge, sometimes without a full understanding of the underlying fundamental physico-chemical relationships and the changes that occur during wood material processing. At the same time the commercial pressures of operating within the forestry sector have resulted in demand for more uniform, high quality, fit-for-purpose product, faster throughput and less downgrade from what is becoming a lower quality feedstock as harvest ages decline. In the 21 st century, the forestry sector is being transformed into an "engineered ligno-cellulosic materials processor" and this in turn is requiring a more sophisticated knowledge of the material feedstock and the processes involved in wood products manufacture. The aim of this work was to use magnetic resonance techniques to explore aspects of ligno-cellulosic materials processing at points along the value-added process chain, namely drying, chemical modification (preservation) and re-engineering (gluing) of wood products. Magnetic resonance mini-imaging studies of the water transport during the drying of radiata pine boards rave shown differences in the directional movement of water within the wood structure. These effects show a dependence on the surface area to volume ratio of timber and the orientation of the annual rings with respect to the larger drying face. Narrow, flat-sawn boards exhibit anomalous drying behaviour in terms of water mass transport, whereas thicker boards display more conventional core-shell drying behaviour. These restrictions to flow have been further investigated using diffusion tensor imaging via a modified pulsed field gradient spin-echo sequence to elucidate the nature of anisotropic diffusion in wood. The direction of least restriction to self-diffusion is in the longitudinal direction, as would be expected with it being the direction of active transport within a tree stem, whereas the direction of greatest restriction to self-diffusion is in the radial direction, with the higher density latewood acting as a barrier. Preservation of radiata pine sapwood with novel boron-based preservatives has been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the penetration and retention of the incipient compounds. An apparent anomaly in retention for trimethylborate-treated Pinus radiata sapwood was investigated by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy of excised sections of latewood and earlywood, which showed hydrolytic decomposition of trimethyl borate to form boric acid. The rate of hydrolysis of trimethylborate was monitored by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy and was shown to occur very rapidly in the latewood (within 24 hours), and over a longer time scale of several days in the earlywood. The resulting publication has reported some of the first published 11 B MRI images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has provided (in conjunction with separate mass spectrometry studies) mechanistic evidence for the accelerated curing of phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde resols, using ammonia in combination with the conventional paraformaldehyde hardener - a process known as GreenWeldTM. Carbon- 13 and nitrogen- 15 NMR spectroscopy has shown evidence of both benzylamine and aniline type bridging structures formed during cure, compared to only methylene structures being formed under conventional curing conditions. Poly(vinyl acetate) emulsion polymer adhesive has also been examined using NMR spectroscopic methods, with particular focus on the effect of addition of aluminium chloride, which is often commercially added to PVAc formulations as a crosslinking agent. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained during the cure of AlCl 3 modified PV Ac adhesive, shows a low frequency 27 Al shift of ca. 3 ppm suggesting a local change in environment as the aluminium changes from a solvated to a covalently bonded octahedral environment. Finally, as a preliminary study, a new device for measuring uniaxial extension of visco-elastic solids was trialled on poly(vinyl acetate) hydrogels to study the effect of addition of aluminium chloride on the visco-elastic properties of the adhesive. A similar, <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>device</b> was used to obtain NMR spectroscopic data during compression of the gel. These studies have shown that addition of aluminium chloride as a crosslinking agent, in fact produces a cured adhesive with fewer crosslinks than the corresponding unmodified adhesive, but with increased resistance to shear-induced creep...|$|E

Designing an ICU-specific communication system involves an even {{deeper understanding of}} patient needs and desires, building on existing work exploring available technologies for use in this setting 1, 2. We report our initial experience from a pilot study with a novel communication device engineered specifically to allow mechanically ventilated ICU patients to communicate with caregivers 3. Methods: We used a validated survey for nurses about communication purposes to explore relevant beliefs, attitudes, and desires of nurses 4. Existing technologies available for communication assistance in the ICU – e. g., letter boards, writing on paper, and mouthing words – were analyzed. Suggestions about the content for an eventual communication system were collected. ICU-specific design requirements were noted, including adherence to infection control standards, accessibility to restrained patients, and availability to patients with motor weakness, contractures, edema, tremor, and/or neuropathy. In addition, the system must include a minimal learning curve, Results: Initial testing in the ICU has revealed additional considerations for technology design. For instance, many patients have visual impairments, so displays should be large and high-contrast. Furthermore, patients benefit from a very short teaching/demo process due to their short attention span. Additionally, leveraging interfaces with significant similarities to everyday systems appears to reduce confusion. Nurses also mentioned that the system should be accessible to at least some non-English-speaking patients. Finally, physical deficits that ICU patients experience require that <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>devices</b> be as flexible as possible in terms of type of manipulation required. Conclusions: ICU patients are in significant need of communication systems that meet their unique needs. Building such a system requires awareness of many different constraints, including both general heterogeneity of patient needs and capabilities and {{the constraints of the}} ICU setting itself...|$|R

Here, we report a novel closed-system, electrohydrostatically driven master-slave device that was designed and constructed for delivering controlled fluidic stimulations of visceral organs and inner cavities {{of the human body}} within the confines of a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The design concept and performance of the device in the MRI environment are described. In addition, the device was applied during a functional MRI (fMRI) investigation of visceral stimulation related to detrusor distention in two representative subjects to verify its feasibility in humans. System evaluation tests demonstrate that the device is MR-compatible with negligible impact on imaging quality [static signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss < 2. 5 % and temporal SNR loss < 3. 5 %], and has an accuracy of 99. 68 % for flow rate and 99. 27 % for volume delivery. A precise synchronization of the stimulus delivery with fMRI slice acquisition was achieved by programming the proposed device to detect the 5 V transistor-transistor logic (TTL) trigger signals generated by the MRI scanner.

40|$|Introduction: Available {{communication}} {{methods for}} intubated {{patients in the}} ICU are insufficient to meet patient needs. Both ICU patients and their care providers report broadly unsuccessful communication attempts, resulting in less effective medical care and undue stress 1, 2. Use of existing methods - including letter boards, writing, and mouthing words - for mechanically ventilated (MV) patients {{has led to a}} consensus that new methods are required 3. We report on the testing of a new system designed to address the communication needs of MV patients that is currently being tested in a low- to medium- acuity surgical ICU 4. Methods: We have developed several generations of prototypes designed to address patient communication needs. Design of this device has focused on ICU-specific communication needs, including ICU-specific content, infection control, simple design, and capitalizing on motor movements that can be easily performed by most ICU patients. Initial testing, starting with non-MV patients able to give more detailed feedback, has begun in a low- to medium- acuity surgical ICU. Recently developed prototypes combine custom-built tablet software, focusing on the needs that nurses believe patients wish to express in the ICU setting, with a newly designed <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> access <b>device.</b> The system produces visual and auditory output to allow patients to answer basic questions and effectively convey information. Results: Initial patient impressions are encouraging, particularly among patients who have recently experienced mechanical ventilation. Many patients are unfamiliar with tablet software or struggle with manual dexterity required to access the tablet screen directly, further indicating the need for an external access method as part of the system. The content suggested by nurses via a previously conducted survey has been confirmed by patients as relevant to their experience.

Provision of views to the exterior is desirable, but more importantly, human health and productivity benefits may result from well day-lit interior spaces. The increased use of natural light, coupled with daylight responsive lighting systems, can reduce the peak electrical load and internal heat gains caused by artificial lighting. However, excessive transmission of solar irradiance {{can result in a}} net increase in energy consumption required for cooling, and may also affect the visual comfort of occupants. <b>Manually</b> <b>operated</b> shading <b>devices</b> are commonly used to deal with this problem, though their control is generally not optimal.

Experimental measurements were carried out using a controlled motorized venetian blind installed on a clear glass window unit in a small-office space.

Following a preliminary study on 9 dogs, 63 pet dogs referred for recall related problems were {{assigned to one of}} three Groups: Treatment Group A were trained by industry approved trainers using e-collars; Control Group B trained by the same trainers but without use of e-collars; and Group C trained by members of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, UK again without e-collar stimulation (n = 21 for each Group). Dogs received two 15 minute training sessions per day for 4 - 5 days. Training sessions were recorded on video for behavioural analysis. Saliva and urine were collected to assay for cortisol over the training period. During preliminary studies there were negative changes in dogs' behaviour on application of electric stimuli, and elevated cortisol post-stimulation. These dogs had generally experienced high intensity stim uli without pre-warning cues during training. In contrast, in the subsequent larger, controlled study, trainers used lower settings with a pre-warning function and behavioural responses were less marked. Nevertheless, Group A dogs spent significantly more time tense, yawned more often and engaged in less environmental interaction than Group C dogs. There was no difference in urinary corticosteroids between Groups. Salivary cortisol in Group A dogs was not significantly different from that in Group B or Group C, though Group C dogs showed higher measures than Group B throughout sampling.

This study addresses the engineering aspects of injecting and deploying drops of prescribed volume into an acoustic positioning chamber in microgravity. The specific problems of interest are the design, testing, and implementation of injector tips {{to be used in}} a simultaneously retracting dual-injector system in the Drop Physics Module microgravity experiment facility. Prior to release, the liquid to be deployed must be retained within a restricted area {{at the very end of}} the injectors under dynamic stimuli from the continuous injection flow as well as from the stepped motion of the injectors. The final released drop must have a well determined volume and negligible residual linear or angular momentum. The outcome of Earth-based short-duration low gravity experiments had been the selection of two types of injector tips which were flown as back-up parts. They were successfully utilized during the USML- 1 Spacelab mission as the primary tips. The combination of a larger contact surface, liquid pinning with a sharp edge, and selective coating of strategic tip surfaces with a non-wetting compound has allowed a significant increase in the success rate of deployment of simple and compound drops of aqueous solutions of glycerol and silicone oil. The diameter of the samples studied in the Drop Physics Module range between 0. 3 and 2. 7 cm. The tests conducted on-orbit with a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> small <b>device</b> have allowed the calibration of the volume deployed for a few drop sizes. The design for improved tips to be used during the next USML flight is based on these results...|$|R
