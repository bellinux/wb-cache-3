40|$|This video {{shows how}} {{to ensure the}} document: •	has <b>mirror</b> <b>margins</b> that {{alternate}} on left and right hand pages •	is A 4 in size •	has margins that are in-line with the regulations •	has its major sections starting on the right hand (odd numbered) page Although this video shows how to perform these tasks in Word 2010, they are virtually identical in Word 2013. In Word 2011 for Mac the steps are very similar and precise details {{can be found in}} the Word 2011 Sections manual. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{template}} is for {{use with}} both Word 2003 (PC) and Word 2004 (Apple Mac). It provides a structure and format that meets with the University's Quality requirements for a thesis. The template has <b>mirror</b> <b>margins</b> set up to allow for double-sided printing. It is not compulsory to use the template when writing a thesis. but it's use will make your thesis well presented and should save {{you a lot of}} time and effort. Since Office 2003 / 2004 are no longer the supported versions of Office used at the University there are no supporting videos...|$|E
40|$|The {{template}} is for {{use with}} both Word 2010 / 2013 / 2016 for PC and Word 2011 / 2016 for Apple Mac. The template {{that used to be}} stored here in EdShare has been moved. Please see the links on the document now stored in this resource. The template provides a structure and format that meets with the University's quality requirements for a thesis such as <b>mirror</b> <b>margins</b> to allow for double-sided printing. It is not compulsory to use the template when writing a thesis, however it's use, in conjunction with the supporting material referenced {{at the start of the}} template, will make your thesis well presented and should save you a lot of time and effort. If you have Word 2003 there is a separate template for this version of Word available. Since this is not a University supported version of Office there are no supporting videos...|$|E
50|$|Since the {{construction}} of the dam, the flow of the Deschutes River deposits sediment from the approximately 700000 acre Upper Deschutes River watershed into Mirror Pond. As a result, sediment has settled behind the dam, creating shallow mudflats along the <b>margins.</b> <b>Mirror</b> Pond is the only impoundment of the upper Deschutes River for electricity.|$|R
50|$|The Foucault {{knife-edge}} {{test was}} described in 1858 by French physicist Léon Foucault to measure conic shapes of optical <b>mirrors,</b> with error <b>margins</b> measurable in fractions of wavelengths of light (or Angstroms, millionths of an inch, or nanometers). It is commonly used by amateur telescope makers for figuring small astronomical mirrors. Its relatively simple, inexpensive apparatus can produce measurements more cost-effectively than most other testing techniques.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} compact and robust focus drive apparatus developed for the IUE's scientific instrumentation {{is based on a}} novel planetary drive that converts the angular increments of a permanent magnet stepping motor into simultaneous linear displacements of three ball screws supporting the secondary <b>mirror.</b> Significant torque <b>margins</b> are thus produced while yielding exceptionally smooth and reliable operation. Attention is given to mechanical drive materials-selection criteria...|$|R
