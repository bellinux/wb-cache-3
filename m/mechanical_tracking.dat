50|$|The Pirinclik (near Diyarbakir, Turkey) {{intelligence}} collection radar site ultimately consisted of one detection radar (FPS-17) and one <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracking</b> radar (FPS-79).

Although limited by their mechanical technology, Pirinclik's two radars gave the advantage of tracking two objects simultaneously in real time. Its location close to the southern Former Soviet Union made it the only ground sensor capable of tracking actual deorbits of Russian space objects.

50|$|In {{order to}} monitor aircraft, {{observers}} used {{a simple but}} effective <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracking</b> device. Where the approximate height of an aircraft is known it becomes possible, by using a horizontal bearing and a vertical angle taken from a known point, to calculate the approximate position of that aircraft. Posts were equipped with a mechanical sighting Post Instrument plotter consisting of a sighting system over a map grid. After setting the instrument with the aircraft's approximate height, the observer would align a sighting bar with the aircraft. This bar was mechanically connected to a vertical pointer which would indicate the approximate position of the aircraft on the map grid. Observers would report the map coordinates, height, time, sector clock code and number of aircraft for each sighting to the aircraft Plotters located at the Centre. Positioned around a large table map, plotters would wear headsets to enable a constant communications link to be maintained with their allocated Cluster of posts, usually three in number.|$|E
50|$|The {{tracking}} {{computer is}} responsible for capturing the images from the optical imaging system, analyzing the image to extract target position and controlling the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracking</b> platform to follow the target. There are several challenges. First the tracking computer {{has to be able}} to capture the image at a relatively high frame rate. This posts a requirement on the bandwidth of the image capturing hardware. The second challenge is that the image processing software {{has to be able to}} extract the target image from its background and calculate its position. Several textbook image processing algorithms are designed for this task. This problem can be simplified if the tracking system can expect certain characteristics that is common in all the targets it will track. The next problem down the line is to control the tracking platform to follow the target. This is a typical control system design problem rather than a challenge, which involves modeling the system dynamics and designing controllers to control it. This will however become a challenge if the tracking platform the system has to work with is not designed for real-time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} {{fretting}} wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel on a SRVoscillating friction and wear tester. The {{results indicate that}} with the frequency and load increasing, both the friction coefficient and fretting wear volume increase. With the amplitude increasing, the fretting wear volume increased too, but the effect of amplitude on friction coefficient was not simple positive correlation according to the experimental results. Meanwhile, the fretting wear mechanism {{is directly related to}} test frequency, load and amplitude. When they are small, the main fretting wear mechanism is abrasive wear, with these test parameters increasing, the main fretting wear mechanism turns to a combination of abrasive wear and adhesion wear. Based on the experimental results, the anti-fretting wear measures of steel worm gear pairs used in <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracked</b> regulator of tracked vehicle are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|As Squaw Valley was an {{undeveloped area}} {{at the time of}} being awarded the Olympics, the {{organizing}} committee was free to build a tailor-made Olympic resort. The organizing committee originally intended to house all events in Squaw Valley proper, but real estate developments in Squaw Valley made this difficult. In 1958 the organizing committee therefore decided to move all cross-country and biathlon events to McKinney Creek. Rolf Gerlofsen had surveyed the area in March 1957, and work on the biathlon tracks and facilities was undertaken and completed during the summer of 1958.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for one-dimensional alignment of small particles such as biological cells. A drop of the particle suspension is {{spread out on}} a flat disk or plate equipped with V-shaped grooves such as are present on a gramophone disk. After drying, the particles are located {{on the bottom of}} the grooves and are thus aligned in a one-dimensional array. The new alignment procedure is demonstrated with a suspension of fluorescent polystyrene micropheres (diameter 3. 8 µm) and a suspension of the unicellular algae chlorella vulgaris (diameter about 3 µm). It appears that the alignment of cells and spheres is very good. When using microspheres, more than 95 % of the particles in the grooves are located within ± 2 µm of the centre line of the groove. Based upon this cell-alignment principle, a new cytometer, named the cytodisk, is proposed. The proposed system has a number of advantages over the flow cytometer, among which is the unique ability of relocating a previously measured cell for further measurement or visual examination. A prototype of a cytodisk, developed for initial test measurements, was built in our laboratory. The apparatus, constructed from a record player and ordinary long-playing records, uses a simple <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracking</b> system and a single optical fiber for fluorescence excitation and detection. With this apparatus it is demonstrated that a cytodisk can indeed perform quite well: A histogram of fluorescing microspheres could be measured with a coefficient of variation of 4. 1 %. The performance of this prototype is limited by the quality of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tracking</b> system and the optical system used. It is expected that considerable improvements may be obtained by using a more sophisticated optical detection system such as the tracking system in use in optical disk players...|$|E
