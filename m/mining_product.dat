50|$|Production of bauxite, {{traditionally}} the principal <b>mining</b> <b>product,</b> ceased in 1992. The Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) mined bauxite between 1959 and 1983, {{when it turned}} its concession over to the state. Production in 1991 dropped 92% from the previous year, as a presidential decree suspended mining operations at the largest mine, in response to increasing fears of deforestation, although reforestation of mined areas was in progress. Output averaged 1 million tons each year.|$|E
50|$|Historically, alum was {{employed}} {{in a range}} of medicinal products, as a food preservative, to clarify water and to finish cloth. However, in the 19th century more effective chemical compounds were developed, and alum ceased to be a profitable <b>mining</b> <b>product.</b> By the 20th century, the Feengrotten had been largely forgotten. But in 1910 the old mine was rediscovered and explorers took note of the fantastic mineral deposits that had accumulated over the geologically short period of three centuries.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the general}} poor returns in recent years, mining retains a certain {{importance}} in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's <b>mining</b> <b>product</b> by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half {{comes from the}} province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at Minas de Riotinto in Huelva (see Rio Tinto Group) dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is coal mining in the Guadiato valley {{in the province of}} Córdoba; various metals at Aznalcóllar in the province of Seville, and iron at Alquife in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia.|$|E

50|$|Information Harvesting (IH) was {{an early}} data <b>mining</b> <b>product</b> from the 1990s. It was invented by Ralphe Wiggins and {{produced}} by the Ryan Corp, later Information Harvesting Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts. IH sought to infer rules from sets of data. It did this first by classifying various input variables into {{one of a number}} of bins, thereby putting some structure on the continuous variables in the input. IH then proceeds to generate rules, trading off generalization against memorization, that will infer the value of the prediction variable, possibly creating many levels of rules in the process. It included strategies for checking if overfitting took place and, if so, correcting for it. Because of its strategies for correcting for overfitting by considering more data, and refining the rules based on that data, IH might also be considered to be a form of machine learning.|$|E

By {{taking advantage of}} {{the fact that most of}} product features are phrases, a concept of shallow dependency parsing is introduced, which extends traditional dependency parsing to phrase level. This concept is then implemented for extracting relation between product features and expressions of opinions. Experimental evaluations show that the mining task can benefit from shallow dependency parsing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are rich}} {{resources}} in Central and South America, and <b>mining</b> <b>products</b> export {{plays an important}} role in the regional economic development. In this paper, the <b>mining</b> <b>products</b> trade information of more than ten years in Central and South America is collected, and then the authors point out that a "diversified export " strategy has been implemented by Central and South America in recent years for reducing the dependence on the economy of the United States, and the export of Central and South America is continuously rising to China but declining to the United States because they are benefited from the great demands of China's development on resources. However, along with the development of the industrialization in the countries of Central and South America, increasingly more resources will be consumed in this region. Therefore, some Central and South American countries will reduce their energy and <b>mining</b> <b>products</b> exports in the future in the condition of meeting their own needs...|$|R

When selecting a data <b>mining</b> <b>product</b> that is appropriate for one’s task, {{it is important to consider}} various features of data mining systems from a multidimensional point of view. Researchers have been striving to build theoretical foundations for data mining.

40|$|While {{there are}} many {{commercial}} systems to help people browse and compare products, these interfaces are typically product centric. To help users identify products that match their needs more efficiently, we instead focus on building a task centric interface and system. Based on answers to initial questions about the situations in which they expect to use the product, the interface identifies products that match their needs, and exposes high-level product features related to their tasks, as well as low-level information including customer reviews and product specifications. We developed semi-automatic methods to extract the high-level features used by the system from online product data. These methods identify and group product features, mine and summarize opinions about those features, and identify product uses. User studies verified our focus on high-level features for browsing products and low-level features and specifications for comparing products.
