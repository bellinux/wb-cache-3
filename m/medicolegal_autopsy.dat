40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} cause of death and related histological findings, and to find relationship between them in sudden natural deaths (SND) that were subjected to <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy.</b> Totally 209 SND cases were enrolled in the study. After <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy,</b> cause and manner of death were identified. A formula was formed to show the ratio of frequency of histological findings to cause of deaths in systems. By this formula, affected systems were compared. In SND cases, the ratio of extracardiac findings to extracardiac deaths was higher than that of cardiovascular findings to cardiovascular deaths (5. 53 versus 2. 00). We concluded that cardiovascular pathologies are still the most common in SND. The higher rate of extracardiac histological findings doesn’t mean higher rate of SND due to extracardiac causes. Therefore, histological findings must be evaluated with great attention for preventing incorrect conclusions to identify causes of deaths in SND...|$|E

METHOD During the period from 1 st July 2014 to 30 November 2015, out of 144 <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies,</b> 120 autopsies of heart were received. Five {{specimen}} of heart were autolyzed so 115 autopsy specimen of heart were included for study. Routine H and E staining is used for microscopic examination. RESULT Out of 115 cases, 74 cases shows atherosclerosis, 33 cases shows features of myocardial infarction, myocardial hypertrophy found in 60 cases, 11 cases shows myocarditis, vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell was present in 6 cases and pericarditis present in 1 case. In 29 cases, there was no identifiable cause of death even after complete gross and microscopic autopsy was performed. CONCLUSION It was concluded that myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic ischaemic heart disease is probably the commonest diagnosis made in majority of sudden death cases subjected to <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies.</b> Histological findings must be evaluated with great attention for preventing incorrect conclusion to identify causes of deaths in sudden death cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of postmortem heart weight is often difficult, and references for normal heart weight are important. However, {{to assess the}} cause of death at a <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy</b> {{it is also important to}} have references based on an unselected population of <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy</b> cases with non-natural causes of death (not due directly to disease). We aimed at studying and deriving references for adult heart weight by considering sex, age and body size in cases with an external cause of death. We identified all medicolegal autopsies in Sweden from 1999 to 2013 (n= 79, 778) and included 27, 645 cases. We applied multivariate piecewise linear regression models in three strata of body mass-underweight, normal-/overweight and obesity. We observed that approximately 50 % of the variation in heart weight was explained by age, sex and body size. These variables were slightly less important in explaining the variation in heart weight in the underweight and obese compared to in those normal or overweight. Based on the linear regression models we present equations to calculate the predicted heart weight with reference intervals using age, sex, body weight and height. We provide an online heart weight calculator ([URL] based on these equations. In the forensic {{interpretation of}} postmortem heart weights, we suggest that heart weight references derived in cases with an external cause of death is an important complement to references solely based on healthy and normal hearts.

40|$|An autopsy may subject prosectors {{and others}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{infectious}} agents, including bloodborne and aerosolized pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other hazards include toxic chemicals (e. g., formalin, cyanide, and organo-phosphates) and radiation from radionuclides used for patient therapy and diagnosis. These risks can be substantially miti-gated through proper assessment, personal protective equip-ment, appropriate autopsy procedures, and facility design.

40|$|The {{meaning and}} {{subject of this}} {{dissertation}} is the statistical analysis of the <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> done in Berlin in the years 1999 till 2003. A special quality {{of the time that}} has been worked is the circumstance, that it is the last moment three medicolegal departments existed. This are the Regional Institute for Medicolegal and Social Medicine of Berlin and the university institutes for medicolegal medicine of the Charité, Humbolt-Universität zu Berlin (HU) {{on the one hand and}} of the Freie Universität Berlin (FU) on the other hand. In the year 2003 the medical faculties of HU and FU were fused to the Charité – Berliner Hochschulmedizin. In the mentioned space of time 11668 <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> were done. The male sex had a component of 65. 6 % (n= 7656), the female of 34. 4 % (n= 4008). The average age of the male bodies that been carried out an autopsy was 50. 8 years, of the female 62. 1 years. The ways of death are distributed following: natural way of death 53. 3 % (n= 6219), unnatural way of death 42. 4 % (n= 4945) and no clear way of death to find out 4. 3 % (n= 504). Detailed analysed were the cases with an unnatural death. The part of the circumstances of the unnantural death were apportioned: homicide victims (5. 5 %, N= 273), accident victims (43. 2 %, n= 2135), suicides (38. 1 %, n= 1884) and no clear circumstance of death to find out (13. 2 %, n= 653). The distribution between the sexes, the mean age and the kind of violence leading to death are shown for every category of circumstances of death. Further the kind of violence causing the death has been of interest. Most frequently were the blunt violence with a component of 33. 1 % (n= 1636), intoxications with 31. 0 % (n= 1532) and strangulation with 12. 1 % (n= 596). Other kinds of violences causing the death are in descending frequency: drowning, shot, sharp violence, heat, coldness, complications in the context of medical diagnostic or therapeutic intervention, suffocation, electricity or the combination of different kinds of violences causing the death. For every category of the circumstances of unnatural death the kinds of violence leading to death are shown gender-related and in frequency of appearence.

40|$|Background. Globally, {{illicit drugs}} are {{responsible}} for many fatalities annually, yet accurate data on {{the nature and extent}} of these deaths in South Africa (SA) are lacking. Objectives. To investigate the presence and profile of illicit drugs detected in deceased persons who were subjected to <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> and upon whom analyses were carried out in search of illicit drugs in their body fluids at the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory (PMLL), SA, over a 10 -year period. METHODS. A retrospective descriptive case audit was conducted for the period 2003 - 2012. RESULTS. Screening for illicit drugs was requested in 385 out of 22 566 <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies.</b> Results were available for only 281 of these cases, with 154 cases showing the presence of one or more illicit drugs. The demographic profile of positive cases indicated the majority to be male (90. 3 %) and white (85. 1 %). Decedents who tested positive for illicit drugs were predominantly aged between 20 and 30 years (51. 9 %). The most frequently detected drug was heroin, the presence of which was confirmed in 35. 2 % of cases, followed by cocaine in 19. 9 %. Alcohol in combination with an illicit drug or drugs was detected in 56 cases (36. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study indicate that illicit drugs were implicated in a considerable number of fatalities in Pretoria. However, it is believed that the figures are a gross under-representation of the actual number of drug users who died during this period. It is therefore recommended that further research be conducted and that drug screening be requested routinely when unnatural deaths are investigated at medicolegal mortuaries, not only to ensure the administration of justice but also to obtain more accurate data for purposes of public health programmes and improve insight into the burden of illicit drug use in SA.

Given the possible link between the assault and the renal pathology, a homicide investigation was initiated. Although renal infarction had been confirmed by hospital pathologists, microscopy with special staining of both kidneys and the heart after autopsy revealed multifocal areas of angioinvasion by fungi having morphologic characteristics of mucormycosis. The only other finding of significance was alcohol-related micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Renal infarction had therefore been caused by an angioinvasive fungal infection predisposed to by immunocompromise associated with alcoholism and not by trauma-induced arterial dissection.

40|$|Abstract Background: An autopsy {{is still}} the most {{accurate}} method to determine the cause of death. Because of this, the reliability of suicide statistics in a country is highly dependent on its autopsy rates. Among several reasons, including low autopsy rates, the under-reporting of suicide in Norway has previously been estimated to be around 25 % or more. In this review the reliability of Norwegian suicide statistics and Norwegian autopsy rates were assessed by a systematic search in different databases. Methods: In January 2014, the databases PubMed and SveMed+ were screened for articles containing studies regarding the reliability of suicide statistics in Norway and/or Norwegian autopsy rates. The search strategy of choice in PubMed was made in free text with the following terms: (suicide OR forensic autopsy OR <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy)</b> AND Norway. In SveMed+ the search strategy included the terms: «selvmord», «obduksjon» and «Norge». The search results were screened by reading the title, and if regarded necessary also the abstract and full text. The Norwegian <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy</b> rates were determined from annual reports from The Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine and The Central Bureau of Statistics in Norway (SSB). Results: The searches generated a total of 850 hits. Of these, only 18 articles published between 1985 and 2012 met the inclusion criteria. Five annual reports from The Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine and from SSB were included; these provided the autopsy rates in suicide fatalities in the period 2007 - 2011. The few studies included estimate that Norway has reliable suicide statistics with an under-reporting of suicide by 10 % or less. The autopsy rates in suicide in the period 2007 - 2011 are estimated to be around 60 %, which is considered to be low. Conclusions: There is little knowledge regarding the reliability of Norwegian suicide statistics. However, according to the few included studies in this review, the under-reporting of suicide in Norway is of 10 % or less, which is low. Having said this, there is need for more research to verify these numbers. The autopsy rates in Norway vary tremendously depending on variables such as region, age, sex, cause of death and manner of death...|$|E

The autopsy surgeon’s focus should not be restricted only to find out the cause of death. He must also be aware of the sentiments of the bereaved family members and relatives of the deceased. In some of the centers in developing countries the case load is about 15 - 20 cases per day. Extensive dissection of the body not only causes disfiguration to some extent but also requires a lot of time for proper reconstruction and suturing so that the body is in a sober state before handing it over to the family members. Time constraint is an important factor for the centers with a large case load. The mental agony and pain of the family members waiting to complete the last rights and rituals is beyond any words of explanation...|$|E
40|$|Depositions for coroners ' inquests on 377 deaths, {{nearly all}} of them homicides, were {{reviewed}} and analyzed for reported causes and circumstances of death. The role of coroner and surgeon and the emergence of the <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy</b> are considered. The records of British coroners ' inquests of past centuries offer much useful information for the social history of medicine. Here are set down the details of fatal accidents, deaths under suspicious circumstances, unexplained sudden deaths, suicides, homicides, and deaths in prison. From the depositions, summarized in written form, of witnesses and from the inquisition itself, an official report signed by the coroner and his jury, the reader can learn the time, place, and circumstances of a death, the name of the person, if any, who was responsible for it, and the crime committed if crime there was. Perusal of a series of well documented inquests discloses much more. Occupations, living and working conditions, medical care or its lack, social attitudes, concern for, or neglect of, children, the aged, the poor, apprentices, laborers, prisoners, all are revealed, directly or indirectly, until a surprisingly vivid impression of the time has emerge. d. But one is not left with impression...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Death from corpora aliena in {{the larynx}} is a {{well-known}} entity in forensic pathology. The correct diagnosis of this cause of death is difficult without an autopsy, and misdiagnoses by external examination alone are common. OBJECTIVE: To determine the postmortem usefulness of modern imaging techniques in the diagnosis of foreign bodies in the larynx, multislice computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and postmortem full-body computed tomography-angiography were performed. DESIGN: Three decedents with a suspected foreign body in the larynx underwent the 3 different imaging techniques before <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsy.</b> RESULTS: Multislice computed tomography has a high diagnostic value in the noninvasive localization of a foreign body and abnormalities in the larynx. The differentiation between neoplasm or soft foreign bodies (eg, food) is possible, but difficult, by unenhanced multislice computed tomography. By magnetic resonance imaging, the discrimination of the soft tissue structures and soft foreign bodies is much easier. In addition to the postmortem multislice computed tomography, the combination with postmortem angiography will increase the diagnostic value. CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem, cross-sectional imaging methods are highly valuable procedures for the noninvasive detection of corpora aliena in the larynx...|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} at tertiary care hospital, government medical college and hospital Nagpur located in central India, where yearly near about 3000 <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> were carried out. We have carried out study on epidemiological profile of the drowning deaths in 176 cases excluding bodies in advanced state of decomposition. The study was carried out over the period of December 2013 to October 2015, {{with the aim of}} studying various epidemiological parameters. The study includes, only the dead bodies which were retrieved from water sources and having history of drowning, brought for post mortem examination. As per law of the land, consent of relatives is not required for carrying out the medicolegal postmortem examination on the corpse of the deceased; hence it was not necessary to obtain consent from relatives or any other authority in this particular study. However, as per the prevailing mandatory standard procedures of the Institute, the prior permission cum no objection certificate to carry out the study was obtained from local ethical committee. Detailed history and relevant information was collected from police inquest and requisition (Panchanama) regarding the age, sex, address, marital status, mental status, occupation, education, religion, supposed cause of and eye witness of incidence etc., and if the relatives were present at the time of postmortem examination, necessary information was collected regarding the personal, mental and behavioral aspect.|$|R
40|$|Background: Electrocutions are {{unusual and}} almost {{accidental}} in nature. They {{have not been}} sufficiently studied earlier in the Union Territory. Objectives: This study {{was focused on the}} magnitude, manner of death, profile, and pattern of injuries among electrocutions. Materials & Methods: We considered 3 -year data of all electrocution-related deaths for which autopsies were carried out at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Postgraduate Institute, Puducherry, from January 2011 to December 2013. We retrospectively reviewed all the medicolegal records and gathered demographic, traumatic and investigative information, and finally analyzed the data. Results: Electrocutions were accounted for 1. 18 % (52) of all <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> (n = 4403) conducted at our study center during those 3 years. The age of the victims were from 18 months to 68 years, but young adults aged between 21 and 30 years (33 %) and males (81 %) were more in numbers. The majority of the victims were Hindus (83 %) and from rural backdrop (56 %). Domestic accidents are clearly prevailed over industrial accidents. Occupants electrocuted most often are agricultural workers (27 %), housewives (19 %), laborers (17 %), and students (12 %). Hands and fingers are the most common sites for entry marks (65 %), whereas soles and toes (17 %) are frequent sites for exit marks in fatal cases. Only entry marks were reported in 58 % cases, but both entry and exit marks were noticed in 23 % cases. All deaths wer...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{department}} of forensic medicine (DFM) {{can be a}} valuable source for tissue donation, but logistics can prove difficult to overcome {{as it pertains to}} obtaining tissues for donation. This article describes the potential of tissues that can be procured for transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sweden has 9. 7 million inhabitants, with an annual mortality rate of 90 000 and 5500 <b>medicolegal</b> <b>autopsies</b> per year. Cooperation between tissue banking and 2 DFMs began in the mid- 1980 s. Recently, cooperation has expanded to include all six DFMs. All tissue establishments (TEs) were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their cooperation with DFMs from 2011 through 2013. RESULTS: A total of 298 actual donors were identified; 1090 tissues were procured including cardiovascular tissue, cornea, sclera, ear bones, and skin for transplantation. Of the tissues distributed, 553 were for transplantation and 72 for other medical purposes. Twenty-three percent of the tissues were discarded. Reasons for tissue rejection included deficient tissue quality (65 %), positive serology tests (9 %), positive bacteriology tests after decontamination procedures (7 %), technical errors (< 1 %), and other reasons (18 %). CONCLUSION: Nineteen percent of all tissues distributed for transplantation came from donors in DFMs. The cooperation between DFMs and TEs was described as well functioning and excellent. Education and national courses in tissue procurement for employees in DFMs are contributing factors to such positive interactions. The support from the National Board of Forensic Medicine is an important factor for sustainable progress...|$|R
