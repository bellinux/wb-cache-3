40|$|AbstractHere {{we report}} on <b>modeling</b> <b>kinetics</b> of the boron-oxygen defect system in {{crystalline}} silicon solar cells. The model, as supported by experimental data, {{highlights the importance of}} defect formation for mitigating carrier-induced degradation. The inability to rapidly and effectively passivate boron-oxygen defects is primarily due to the unavailability of the defects for passivation, rather than any “weakness” of the passivation reaction. The theoretical long-term stability of modules in the field is investigated as a worst-case scenario using typical meteorological year data and the System Advisor Model (SAM). With effective mounting of the modules, the modelling indicates that even in desert locations, destabilisation of the passivation is no concern within 40 years. We also incorporate the quadratic dependence of the defect formation rate on the total hole concentration, and highlight the influence of changing doping densities or changing illumination intensity on the CID mitigation process...|$|E

40|$|This study verifies a {{single-stage}} reaction-rate {{model for}} {{the long-term effects of}} various fire retardants. The adequacy of predictions from our previously reported models was tested using data from fire-retardant-treated wood exposed at 66 C (150 F) and 75 % relative humidity for 3 or 4 years. Our analysis showed that if the treated wood experienced significant thermal degradation early during exposure to high temperature, then the previously reported model parameters adequately predicted thermal degradation for up to 4 years of steady-state exposure. However, if the treated wood did not experience significant thermal degradation early during high-temperature exposure, then the previous parameter estimates tended to underpredict degrade. Modified parameter estimates are presented where appropriate. This report also describes the practical implications of running the verified models for up to 10 annual iterations of an actual year of measured roof sheathing temperatures derived from structures exposed in the field. Our results predict that monoammonium phosphate, a generic fire-retardant formulation, can be expected to cause an additional 15 % loss in original strength capacity in 10 years if used for roof sheathing under similar conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{necessity}} to reduce CO 2 emission {{in the environment}} has encouraged people to search for solutions for its safe capture and storage. Known methods for carbon dioxide mineral sequestration are based primarily {{on the use of}} its binding reaction with metal oxides, mainly earth metals. Increasingly important, due to the availability and price, are processes based on the suspension of various wastes such as fly ash, cement dust or furnace slag. Due to the complexity of the mineral sequestration of CO 2 in water-waste suspensions, an important issue is to determine the reaction mechanisms. This applies mainly to the initial period of the transformation phase of mineral wastes, and consequently with the occurrence of a number of transition states of ionic equilibria. The mechanisms and reaction rates in the various stages of the process of CO 2 mineral sequestration in heterogeneous systems containing selected wastes are defined herein. This paper presents a method of <b>modeling</b> <b>kinetics</b> of this type of process, developed {{on the basis of the}} results of the absorption of CO 2 thanks to the aqueous suspension of fly ash and cement dust.

The advantages are energy efficiency, process sustainability and high product quality.

40|$|Polycrystalline NiTi Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{have been}} {{experimentally}} shown to exhibit some important features and effects under pure tension {{and more complex}} loading. These features are either rate dependent or connected to moving interface between austenite and marten site phases. They include observed peak and valley in stress during loading and unloading respectively, propagation stress plateaus, inhomogeneous deformation (transformation localization and front propagation) during transformation, stress relaxation, etc. It has also been experimentally observed that polycrystalline NiTi wires, strips, and tubes develop transformation strain via nucleation and growth of macroscopic martensitic domains under mechanical loading. Associated with these responses during transformation evolution are complex interactions between mechanical work, heat production, and loading rates. These interactions will affect the performance of SMAs when deployed as active components. Modeling effort is, therefore, needed to better understand this behavior. This study is a worthwhile contribution towards modeling these experimentally observed features and their effect so as to aid SMA design and applications. A 3 D thermodynamically consistent, thermomechanical, macroscopic phase field model capable of <b>modeling</b> <b>kinetics</b> of phase transition and hysteretic response of SMAs is presented.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of directives and regulations by the EU requires {{the development of}} alternative testing strategies as opposed to animal testing for risk assessment of xenobiotics. Additionally, high attrition rates of drugs late in the discovery phase demand improvement of current test batteries applied in the preclinical phase within the pharmaceutical area. These issues were {{taken up by the}} EU founded 7 th Framework Program “Predict-IV”; with the overall goal to improve the predictability of safety of an investigational product, after repeated exposure, by integration of “omics” technologies applied on well established in vitro approaches. Three major target organs for drug-induced toxicity were in focus: liver, kidney and central nervous system. To relate obtained dynamic data with the in vivo situation, kinetics of the test compounds have to be evaluated and extrapolated by physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. This thesis assessed in vitro kinetics of the selected test compounds (cyclosporine A, adefovir dipivoxil and cisplatinum) regarding their reliability and relevance to respective in vivo pharmacokinetics. Cells were exposed daily or every other day to the test compounds at two concentration levels (toxic and non-toxic) for up to 14 days. Concentrations of the test compounds or their major biotransformation products were determined by LC-MS/MS or ICP-MS in vehicle, media, cells and plastic adsorption samples generated at five different time-points on the first and the last treatment day. Cyclosporine A bioaccumulation was evident in primary rat hepatocytes (PRH) at the high concentration, while efficient biotransformation mediated by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 was determined in primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and HepaRG cells. The lower biotransformation in PRH is in accordance with observation made in vivo with the rat being a poor model for CYP 3 A biotransformation. Further, inter-assay variability was noticed in PHH caused by biological variability in CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 activity in human donors. The inter-assay variability observed for PRH and HepaRG cells was a result of differences between vehicles regarding their cyclosporine A content. Cyclosporine A biotransformation was more prominent in HepaRG cells due to stable and high CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 activity. In addition, in vitro clearances were calculated and scaled to in vivo. All scaled in vitro clearances were overestimated (PRH: 10 -fold, PHH: 2 -fold, HepaRG cells: 2 -fold). These results should be proven by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and additional experiments, in order to verify that these overestimations are constant for each system and subsequently can be diminished by implementation of further scaling factors. Brain cell cultures, primary neuronal culture of mouse cortex cells and primary aggregating rat brain cells, revealed fast achieved steady state levels of cyclosporine A. This indicates a chemical distribution of cyclosporine A between the aqueous and organic phases and only minor involvement of biological processes such as active transport and biotransformation. Hence, cyclosporine A uptake into cells is presumably transport mediated, supported by findings of transporter experiments performed on a parallel artificial membrane and Caco- 2 cells. Plastic adsorption of cyclosporine A was significant, but different for each model, and should be considered by physiologically based pharmacokinetic <b>modeling.</b> <b>Kinetics</b> of adefovir dipivoxil highlights the limits of in vitro approaches. Active transporters are required for adefovir uptake, but were not functional in RPTECT/TERT 1. Therefore, adefovir uptake was limited to passive diffusion of adefovir dipivoxil, which itself degrades time-dependently under culture conditions. Cisplatinum kinetics, studied in RPTEC/TERT 1 cells, indicated intracellular enrichment of platinum, while significant bioaccumulation was not noted. This could be due to cisplatinum not reaching steady state levels within 14 days repeated exposure. As shown in vivo, active transport occurred from the basolateral to apical side, but with lower velocity. Hence, obtained data need to be modeled to estimate cellular processes, which can be scaled and compared to in vivo. Repeated daily exposure to two different drug concentrations makes it possible to account for bioaccumulation at toxic concentrations or biotransformation/extrusion at non-toxic concentrations. Potential errors leading to misinterpretation of data were reduced by analyses of the vehicles as the applied drug concentrations do not necessarily correspond to the nominal concentrations. Finally, analyses of separate compartments (medium, cells, plastic) give insights into a compound’s distribution, reduce misprediction of cellular processes, e. g. biotransformation, and help to interpret kinetic data. On the other hand, the limits of in vitro approaches have also been pointed out. For correct extrapolation to in vivo, it is essential that the studied in vitro system exhibits the functionality of proteins, which {{play a key role in}} the specific drug induced toxicity. Considering the benefits and limitations, it is worth to validate this long-term treatment experimental set-up and expand it on co-culture systems and on organs-on-chips with regard to alternative toxicity testing strategies for repeated dose toxicity studies. Die Erlassung von Richtlinien und Verordnungen durch die EU führte zu der Entwicklung von alternativen Testmethoden als Ersatz von Tierversuchen zur Risikobewertung von Xenobiotika. Des Weiteren weisen hohe Ausfallraten von Arzneimitteln in der späten Entwicklungsphase auf die Notwendigkeit hin, die bisher verwendeten Testmethoden der präklinischen Phase zu verbessern. Diese Punkte wurden in dem im siebten Rahmenprogramm der EU finanzierten Projekt „Predict-IV“ aufgegriffen. Ziel des Projektes war es, die Vorhersage der Arzneimittelsicherheit durch integrierte „omics“-Technologien, angewendet an etablierten in vitro Ansätzen, zu verbessern. Dabei standen drei Zielorgane bzgl. Arzneimittel-induzierter Organtoxizität im Mittelpunkt: Leber, Niere und zentrales Nervensystem, die jeweils durch Zelllinien oder primäre Zellen vertreten waren. Um die in vitro generierten Dynamik-Daten mit der in vivo Situation in Korrelation zu bringen, muss die Kinetik der Testsubstanz berücksichtigt und die Ergebnisse mit Hilfe von physiologisch-basierter pharmakokinetischer Modellierung extrapoliert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, Kinetik-Daten der gewählten Testsubstanzen (Cyclosporin A, Adefovir dipivoxil und Cisplatin) in vitro zu erheben und bzgl. ihrer Zuverlässigkeit sowie ihrer Relevanz verglichen mit in vivo Daten zu beurteilen. Hierfür wurden kultivierte Zellen täglich bzw. jeden zweiten Tag für zwei Wochen mit zwei verschiedenen Konzentrationen (toxisch und nicht toxisch) des Arzneimittels behandelt. Der Gehalt des applizierten Arzneimittels oder die Hauptmetaboliten wurden mittels LC MS/MS oder ICP-MS in Vehikel, Medium und Zellen sowie die vom Plastik adsorbierte Menge in Proben bestimmt, die am ersten und letzten Behandlungstag zu fünf unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten gewonnen wurden. Eine eindeutige Bioakkumulation von Cyclosporin A wurde in primären Rattenhepatozyten nach Behandlung mit der hohen Konzentration festgestellt. Eine effiziente CYP 3 A 4 - und CYP 3 A 5 -vermittelte Biotransformation von Cyclosporin A wurde für primäre humane Hepatozyten sowie HepaRG Zellen beobachtet. Diese Ergebnisse stimmten mit der in vivo Situation überein. Ratten sind aufgrund ihrer geringen CYP 3 A Aktivität schlechte Tiermodelle für CYP 3 A-Biotransformationsstudien. Des Weiteren wurden Interassay-Schwankungen bei primären human Hepatozyten bemerkt, die auf die biologische Variabilität der CYP 3 A 4 - sowie CYP 3 A 5 -Aktivität zwischen den menschlichen Spendern zurückzuführen sind. Rattenhepatozyten und HepaRG Zellen hingegen wiesen Interassay-Schwankungen auf, die durch unterschiedliche Cyclosporin A Behandlungskonzentrationen zwischen den Replikaten verursacht wurden. Die Cyclosporin A Biotransformation war in HepaRG Zellen am stärksten ausgeprägt, was durch stabile und wesentlich höhere CYP 3 A 4 - und CYP 3 A 5 -Aktivität in HepaRG Zellen zu erklären ist. Zusätzlich wurden die in vitro Clearance-Werte bestimmt und auf in vivo Clearance-Werte extrapoliert. Alle extrapolierten Werte waren zu hoch geschätzt (primäre Rattenhepatozyten: 10 fach, primäre human Hepatpzyten: 2 fach, HepaRG Zellen: 2 fach). Diese Ergebnisse sollten mittels physiologisch-basierter pharmakokinetischer Modellierung sowie durch weitere Experimente überprüft werden, um zu ermitteln, ob diese hohen Schätzungen für jedes System konstant sind und somit durch die Einführung von weiteren Skalierungsfaktoren verringert werden können. Kultivierte Gehirnzellen, primäre Nervenzellkulturen der Kortex von Mäusen und primäre Hirnzellaggregate der Ratte, zeigten schnell erreichte Cyclosporin A Gleichgewichtskonzentrationen. Diese Ergebnisse deuteten auf eine Verteilung von Cyclosporin A zwischen der wässrigen und organischen Phase hin, wobei biologische Prozesse nur eine untergeordnete Rolle spielen. Daher scheint die intrazelluläre Cyclosporin A Aufnahme Transporter-vermittelt zu sein. Ergebnisse der Transporter Experimente, die an einer künstlichen Membran und Caco- 2 Zellen durchgeführt wurden, unterstützten diese Hypothese. Messungen der Plastikbindung von Cyclosporin A zeigten signifikante, aber für jedes Zellsystem unterschiedliche, Adsorptionsraten, die mittels physiologisch-basierter pharmakokinetischer Modellierung berücksichtigt werden sollten. Die Kinetik von Adefovir dipivoxil machte auf die Nachteile von in vitro Versuchen aufmerksam. Für die intrazelluläre Aufnahme von Adefovir sind aktive Transportproteine nötig, die jedoch in der Nierenzelllinie RPTEC/TERT 1 nicht funktionell vorhanden sind. Daher war die Aufnahme von Adefovir auf die passive Diffusion von Adefovir dipivoxil beschränkt, das aber auch zeitabhängig unter den experimentellen Konditionen zerfiel. Die an RPTEC/TERT 1 Zellen untersuchte Kinetik von Cisplatin deutete auf eine intrazelluläre Platin-Anreicherung hin, die jedoch nicht in einer signifikanten Bioakkumulation resultierte. Möglicherweise sind innerhalb von 14 Tagen die Gleichgewichtskonzentrationen von Cisplatin noch nicht erreicht. Die Kinetikprofile von Cisplatin in Medium ließen einen aktiven, von der basolateralen zur apikalen Seite gerichteten Cisplatin Transport erkennen, wie schon in vivo beschrieben, wobei die Geschwindigkeit dieser Transportprozesse in vitro langsamer zu sein scheint als in der intakte Niere. Daher müssen die generierten Daten zur Schätzung von zellulären Prozessen modelliert werden, um durch anschließende Extrapolation mit in vivo Daten verglichen werden zu können. Abschließend bleibt zu sagen, dass das experimentelle Design vorteilhaft war. Wiederholte tägliche Administration von zwei unterschiedlichen Konzentrationen eines Medikaments ermöglichte die Erfassung von Bioakkumulation bei toxischen Konzentrationen sowie Biotransformation/Export bei nicht-toxischen Konzentrationen. Potenzielle Fehler, die zu einer Fehlinterpretation führen könnten, wurden durch die exakte Bestimmung der tatsächlich applizierten Arzneimittelmenge reduziert, da nicht immer die applizierte Konzentration mit der Nominalkonzentration übereinstimmt. Darüber hinaus erwies es sich als Vorteil, die Arzneimittelkonzentrationen in den einzelnen Kompartimenten (Medium, Zellen und Plastik) zu bestimmen. Somit konnten zum einen Erkenntnisse über die Verteilung der Substanz gewonnen werden und zum anderen Fehleinschätzungen von zellulären Prozessen, z. B. Biotransformation, verhindert werden, was letzten Endes bei die Interpretation von Kinetik-Daten behilflich ist. Jedoch, wurden auch die Grenzen von in vitro Ansätzen deutlich. Für eine korrekte Extrapolation ist es unverzichtbar, dass die untersuchten in vitro Systeme funktionierende Proteine aufweisen, die bei der untersuchten Arzneimittel-induzierten Toxizität eine Schlüsselrolle übernehmen. Abschließend kann festgehalten werden, dass es, unter Berücksichtigung der Vor- und Nachteile, von Nutzen sein kann diesen Versuchsansatz der Langzeitbehandlung zu validieren und darüber hinaus auf Co Kultursysteme sowie Organ-Chips anzuwenden hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von Alternativmethoden für Toxizitätsstudien bei wiederholter Gabe...|$|E

In this study, an attempt {{has been made to}} investigate the efficiency of guava bark as an adsorbent for removal of nickel. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the various parameters such as effect of initial concentration, effect of adsorbent dose and contact time. The adsorption equilibrium data was analyzed by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm <b>models.</b> <b>Kinetics</b> and thermodynamic study were very useful in understanding removal of nickel ions from aqueous solution...|$|R
40|$|Phenol {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{pollutant}} in wastewater. Various methods are available for phenol removal, both biological and non biological. Phenol removal by adsorption is widely studied area of investigation. The kinetics and isotherm studies are major part of studies carried out in this regard. These studies are important with respect to adsorption capacity, loading and time. The current review aims at presenting the summery of the research carried out in order to investigate isotherm and kinetics. It was observed during this review that in most of the investigations solute uptake kinetics was second order in nature and Langmuir isotherm was better fitted to the data.

The two compartment <b>model</b> <b>kinetics</b> analysis of plasma clarithromycin concentration versus time data revealed that the average � SD values of t 1 / 2 �, clearance and volume of distribution are 1. 36 � 0. 14 h, 20. 43 � 3. 04 l/h and 39. 91 � 1. 461 l/kg respectively. The absorption rate constant, area under curve (AUC) and mean resident time with � SD are 0. 51 � 0. 05 h, 12. 36 � 1. 43 h. mg/l and 4. 17 � 43 h respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of various interface forces on membrane fouling during reverse-osmosis (RO) filtration of organic solutions is investigated. Some monoaromatic compounds {{are used as}} model foulants. Isothermal data demonstrate that the adsorption of aromatic compounds on the membrane surface fits the Freundlich model better than the Langmuir <b>model.</b> <b>Kinetics</b> data are better correlated with the pseudo-second-order model than the pseudo-first-order one. The affinity of monoaromatic compounds to the RO membrane is evaluated. Statistical analysis of results indicates that the initial fouling rate {{is dominated by the}} electrostatic attraction and the hydrophobic force while irreversible fouling is mainly controlled by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the membrane surface and organic compounds. </p...|$|R

When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is <b>modelled</b> by exponential <b>kinetics.</b> During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always <b>modelled</b> by exponential <b>kinetics.</b> This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|R
