50|$|Telephone magnetos {{featured}} a large gear rotated by {{hand with a}} handle, that drove a much smaller gear on the armature rotor, providing a high gear-ratio to increase the rotational speed of the <b>magneto</b> <b>armature.</b> A mechanical switch on the output terminals engaged only when the rotor was turning, so that the magneto was normally disconnected from the telephone circuitry.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} compute the normal force that acts on the mover of an electromagnetic planar actuator. The method {{is based on the}} Maxwell Stress Tensor and depends on the resulting magnetic field. The actuator has a mover with two permanent magnets and a ferromagnetic stator covered by two orthogonal armature coils. The mover is hold by a suspension system with linear bearings that enable bi-directional motion. A normal force is present and it depends on the magnetic flux density distribution produced by the permanent magnets and on the <b>armature</b> <b>magneto</b> motive force, since the latter contributes to that distribution. This paper focuses the analysis of that normal force in order to assess its effects on the actuator and in a way that allows the proper design of the mechanical parts that will be affected by it...|$|R
