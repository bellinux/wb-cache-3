500|$|Damage on Guam was {{heaviest}} {{from the}} central region to the northern coast, in particular to tourist areas and military bases. The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area <b>Master</b> <b>Station</b> was shut down due to power outages and water damage to the generators. 2 US Navy Ships; The USS Niagara Falls (AFS-3) and the [...] USS White Plains (AFS-4)— both naval supply ships—went aground due to rough seas and strong winds, and the dry dock at Apra Harbor was washed ashore. Omar destroyed dozens of businesses on the island. High winds knocked a crane into an apartment building and downed 400wooden and 20concrete power poles across Tumon, leaving 70% of the island without power. Throughout Guam, Omar disrupted transportation and communication systems, {{and led to the}} failure of water pumping systems. Landslides covered roads, and low-lying areas were flooded. About 2,000homes were destroyed and another 2,200 were damaged to varying degrees, displacing nearly 3,000people. Destruction was heaviest to wooden structures; buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during the storm. Island-wide, damage totaled $457million, split nearly evenly between the military bases and civilian damage. One person died on Guam, and more than 200people required emergency treatmentincluding about 80injured by flying debris.|$|E

2500|$|Although LORAN {{deliberately}} {{used the}} same display as Gee, the signals were so much longer and more complex than Gee that direct measurement of the two signals was simply not possible. Even the initial signal from the <b>master</b> <b>station</b> was spread out {{in time with the}} initial groundwave signal being sharp (if received), while the skywave receptions could appear anywhere on the display. Accordingly, the LORAN operator instead set the delays so the master signal appeared on one trace and the slave on the second, allowing the complex patterns to be compared. This meant that only one master/slave measurement could be made at once; to produce a [...] "fix", the entire measurement procedure had to be repeated a second time using a different set of stations. Measurement times on the order of three to five minutes were typical, requiring the navigator {{to take into account the}} motion of the vehicle during this time.|$|E
