5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as <b>Must</b> <b>See</b> TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E

5|$|Back at the Emperor's palace, Faythe {{decides that}} she <b>must</b> <b>see</b> Gabriel again. Disguising herself, {{she begins to}} travel back to Ravenskill. Arabelle, knowing about her daughter's intentions, instructs Daryus to follow and protect her. Daryus feels {{he has always been}} {{overlooked}} by his father in favor of his sister, so he travels to the town with his own intentions ("A Life Left Behind"). Faythe arrives in the town and finds Xander, who trusts her and leads her to his father Arhys. Faythe convinces Arhys that she can help, so he brings her to Gabriel's hideout. Gabriel and Faythe embrace, and she tells him that she believes she can convince her father to give up his hunt for Gabriel ("Ravenskill"). Gabriel tells her that if he could just meet with the Emperor, he could inspire him to restore peace to the land using his gift of music ("Chosen").|$|E

The film has been included in the book 1001 Movies You <b>Must</b> <b>See</b> Before You Die, film lists by Empire magazine, and The Guardian.|$|E
5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she <b>must</b> <b>see</b> the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E

25|$|While {{the story}} of the world's {{beginning}} is considered a myth, on the other hand, the Buddhist doctrine requires a constant sceptical approach, where one <b>must</b> <b>see</b> and prove it before one believes it (ehipassiko).

25|$|The Apprentice was the {{breakout}} rookie {{hit of the}} 2003–04 U.S. television {{season and}} helped NBC {{at a time when}} the network's two long-running successful comedies, Friends and Frasier, were ending their series' runs.

25|$|The Greek {{belief of}} ideal forms was later {{extended}} by Plato in his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai:ideas). The Greek word idea (ιδέα:idea) {{has the same}} roots with the words idein (ιδείν:to see), eidos (είδος:species), and probably with oida (οίδα:know), therefore one <b>must</b> <b>see</b> something in order to know it. Originally, the words were applied to such obvious forms as the human body. The transference of the words from visible to invisible show how the Greek mind moved from the gift of senses to the principles behind them which were also used {{in the art of}} sculpture.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} enter any section of line, the train crew must obtain {{permission}} from Control and the relevant token. Each section of {{line is a}} token block section. The WHR uses the traditional Staff and Ticket system in which trains can either be issued with the section token staff or a numbered ticket. Tickets allow multiple trains to pass one-at-a-time through a section in one direction. The Controller advises the train crew which method they will be using. Tickets are kept in a locked box opened by a key on the token staff. This means the last train must use the token staff {{to pass through the}} section, so it can be used for trains to travel in the opposite direction. For additional protection, both the footplate crew and the guard <b>must</b> <b>see</b> the token or ticket before the train can depart.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2016, {{a federal}} judge ruled that Hinckley {{would be allowed to}} be {{released}} from St. Elizabeth's on August 5, as he was no longer considered a threat to himself or others. The pivotal conditions of his release are that he has no contact with the Reagan family, the Brady family, or Jodie Foster. He will live with his 90-year-old mother and be restricted to a 50-mile zone around her home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and will live full-time at his mother's home. As part of his release, he is excluded from speaking to the press, has to work three days a week, can drive no more than 30 miles from his mother's home or 50 miles if attended, and <b>must</b> <b>see</b> a psychiatrist twice a month.|$|E
