40|$|Abstract- In This paper “MMS Based Car Security System ” {{is being}} {{proposed}} {{to solve the}} issue. It introduces the integration between monitoring and tracking system. Both elements are very crucial {{in order to have}} a powerful security system. The system can send SMS and MMS to the owner to have fast response especially if the car is nearby. This paper focuses on using MMS and SMS technology. As soon as there is intrusion detected, first the SMS is sent to <b>master</b> <b>user</b> and the picture of the intruder will be sent via local GSM/GPRS service provider to user (and / or) police mail ID. The implementation and testing results show the success of prototype in sending MMS to owner within 30 seconds. The timing and results are suitable to owner and police to take suitable action against intruder. User can also control the module using command. User has to send different SMS to module while configuration of module for master. <b>Master</b> <b>user</b> can be change as per need, only <b>master</b> <b>user</b> can make changes in to the module...|$|E

We conduct a home-use test for one week to evaluate the efficiency of customization and the usability of menu customization. The results show that the average rank of used functions on the last day of the test is half of that of first day and almost 70 % of the users are satisfied with the ranking provided by menu customization and the usability of menus.

This is an attempt to fulfill the same so that the people can easily learn and master a new kind of art by themselves by using Kinect. The focus of this project is to master Kung-Fu, an ancient form of Chinese Martial Arts. Kung-Fu requires a good amount of practice and therefore needs a Kung-Fu expert mentoring all the time, which is quite expensive. Therefore, the idea is to develop an application which will help the user in imitating the actions performed by the experts and then comparing the performed actions with the captured recordings of experts. While doing the same motions like a <b>master,</b> <b>users</b> can judge themselves by using Kinect.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{advent of}} massively {{parallel}} sequencing technologies (Next Generation Sequencing, NGS) profoundly modified {{the landscape of}} human genetics. In particular, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is the NGS branch {{that focuses on the}} exonic regions of the eukaryotic genomes; exomes are ideal to help us understanding high-penetrance allelic variation and its relationship to phenotype. A complete WES analysis involves several steps which need to be suitably designed and arranged into an efficient pipeline. Managing a NGS analysis pipeline and its huge amount of produced data requires non trivial IT skills and computational power. RESULTS: Our web resource WEP (Whole-Exome sequencing Pipeline web tool) performs a complete WES pipeline and provides easy access through interface to intermediate and final results. The WEP pipeline is composed of several steps: 1) verification of input integrity and quality checks, read trimming and filtering; 2) gapped alignment; 3) BAM conversion, sorting and indexing; 4) duplicates removal; 5) alignment optimization around insertion/deletion (indel) positions; 6) recalibration of quality scores; 7) single nucleotide and deletion/insertion polymorphism (SNP and DIP) variant calling; 8) variant annotation; 9) result storage into custom databases to allow cross-linking and intersections, statistics and much more. In order to overcome the challenge of managing large amount of data and maximize the biological information extracted from them, our tool restricts the number of final results filtering data by customizable thresholds, facilitating the identification of functionally significant variants. Default threshold values are also provided at the analysis computation completion, tuned with the most common literature work published in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Through our tool a user can perform the whole analysis without knowing the underlying hardware and software architecture, dealing with both paired and single end data. The interface provides an easy and intuitive access for data submission and a user-friendly web interface for annotated variant visualization. Non-IT <b>mastered</b> <b>users</b> can access through WEP to the most updated and tested WES algorithms, tuned to maximize the quality of called variants while minimizing artifacts and false positives.
