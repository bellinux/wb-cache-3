50|$|El Nido {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} and best conceived of the interwar Spanish Mission style houses erected in Brisbane, important in illustrating the principal characteristics of its type: a substantial, decorative, <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> designed in the Spanish Mission style {{to take advantage of a}} steeply sloping block with extensive views across Brisbane and along the Brisbane River.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1900s, many upper-class residences, {{including}} characteristic brownstone buildings, were erected along Eastern Parkway. Away from the parkway were a mixture of lower <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences.</b> This development peaked in the 1920s. Before World War II Crown Heights was among New York City's premier neighborhoods, with tree-lined streets, an array of cultural institutions and parks, and numerous fraternal, social and community organizations.|$|R
50|$|The Adam style {{found its}} niche {{from the late}} 1760s in upper-class and <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> in 18th-century England, Scotland, Russia (where it was {{introduced}} by Scottish architect Charles Cameron), and post-Revolutionary War United States (where it became known as Federal style and took on a variation of its own). The style was superseded from around 1795 onwards by the Regency style and the French Empire style.|$|R
5000|$|The Southside lies {{along the}} south bank of the Susquehanna River, {{connected}} to downtown by several bridges. At {{the base of the}} historic South Washington Street Bridge is the Southbridge commercial district. [...] The neighborhood is partitioned into two separate neighborhood assemblies, divided by Pennsylvania Avenue and Southbridge, due to their distinct characters. [...] Southside East contains working-class residences and some public housing projects, while Southside West is primarily made up of larger <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences.</b>|$|R
50|$|Crowell Mitchell House is a {{historic}} home located at Batesburg-Leesville, Lexington County, South Carolina. It {{was built in the}} 1880s and is a two-story, frame Victorian dwelling. The front facade features ornamental double-tiered porches which connect flanking bays. It is representative of a typical <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> with spacious simple rooms, large window area, and scrollwork balustrades.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{many years}} of pragmatic {{institutional}} maintenance and incremental change to suit changing functions, each historical layer of building work is clearly articulated, with limited impact on earlier fabric. The buildings in their front garden setting present a cohesive, substantially intact group demonstrating the principal characteristics of both a substantial, [...] <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> and a [...] convalescent home.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{important}} in illustrating the principal characteristics of a generously-sized <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> of the early 20th century. The interior in particular is remarkably intact, including the internal layout, fabric, and finishes - such as early graining to the joinery and wall and floor finishes, patterned wax papers on the transom lights over the internal doors, and s electric light shades.|$|E
50|$|The South Scott Street Historic District {{encompasses}} {{a small portion}} of a residential area south of downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. It includes the 2400 block of South Scott Street, and one block of 24th Street just to its west. Developed between about 1890 and 1950, this area has one of the city's best-preserved concentrations of modest <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> from that period. It includes fourteen buildings, ranging stylistically from the Queen Anne to the post-World War II vernacular.|$|R

50|$|The house's exact {{construction}} date is not known, but is conjectured to {{be about}} 1769. It was built by Samuel Hayes II, a prominent local leader who led militia forces during the French and Indian War. The house bears some similarity of style to another house (extensively altered in the 19th century) built {{in what is now}} East Granby in 1769 for one of Hayes' officers. These two houses and one other in Windsor are the only known examples of period housing that have steeply pitched hip roofs on what are basically <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Killila was {{constructed}} [...] as {{a much smaller}} cottage, which was substantially refurbished and extended early in the 20th century. It is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history, illustrating in its fabric the pattern of upward social mobility from worker's cottage to <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence,</b> which characterized the struggle of Irish immigrants in Queensland to succeed in their new country and to raise the status of Catholics in an Anglican-dominated society.|$|E
50|$|Hutchinson died at Eskgrove in 1854, {{following}} {{which his}} wife and children appear to have returned to Sydney. Their Brisbane house was retained as a rental property. Eskgrove was a <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> with fine river views, and was occupied by a number of persons prominent in the development of early Queensland, including squatters William Kent Jr (1857-58) and Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1858-59), Governor Bowen's private secretary Abram Moriarty (1859-60), Lieutenant George Poynter Heath, RN, Portmaster of Queensland (-) and Robert Kerr Acheson by 1868.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} also {{significant}} for {{its association with}} James Duhig (1871-1965), the prominent Queensland Catholic Archbishop from 1917 to 1965. During his religious career, Duhig helped raise the status of Catholicism in Queensland and played an influential role in the social, economic and political issues facing the State from the 1920s to the 1950s. As a youth, Duhig resided at Killila Cottage at Stoneleigh Street for several years before embarking for Rome to study for the priesthood. It was during his time at the Windsor residence that he first became {{actively involved in the}} Brisbane Catholic community. The house remained in the Duhig family for close to 50 years, during which time it was transformed into a <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} middle-class American {{families}} draws on ethnography and urban economic history, focusing on patterns of leisure time and household consumption and clutter. We trace how residential life evolved historically from cramped urban quarters into contemporary <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> and examine how busy working families use house spaces. Our ethnographic sample consists of 24 Los Angeles families {{in which both}} parents work full time, have young children, and own their homes. Formal datasets include systematically timed family uses of home spaces, a large digital archive of photographs, and family-narrated video home tours. This analysis highlights a salient home-storage crisis, a marked shift in the uses of yards and garages, and the dissolution of outdoor leisure for busy working parents.

5000|$|He {{started his}} career in the 1970s as a {{conceptual}} photographer. In 1977, he published a collection of photographs he found in corporate and government archives called Evidence with fellow photographer Mike Mandel. The New York Times characterized Evidence as [...] "a watershed in the history of art photography." [...] The two men also created billboards aimed at slowing down road traffic. He then published Pictures From Home, a collection of photographs taken of his parents in the San Fernando Valley from 1982 to 1992, whose role was to question societal expectations of gender and aging. His 2004 assignment for Maxim, which consisted of photographs of <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> rented by the porn industry in the San Fernandino Valley, led to another photographic series called The Valley. He photographed Paris Hilton for Interview in his parents' bedroom in his childhood home.|$|R
50|$|When {{he built}} the house, Conrad Beir was {{simultaneously}} {{serving as the}} pastor of the German Methodist Church in Greenville and in business as a tailor. His daughter Anna {{was born in the}} house in 1873, and it remained her residence until her death in 1939. The house is a plain brick structure built in a simple rectangular shape, two stories tall; the gabled facade is divided into three bays. Set on a stone foundation, the brick house is topped with a metal roof and features miscellaneous stone elements; it is typical of <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> of the period. For much of her life, Beir was a prominent educator; her thirty-six-year tenure in the city schools gave her a high reputation both locally and in the wider region. Although multiple colleges attempted to win her away, her dedication to Greenville and her influence on the city's residents prompted her to decline all such requests in favor of remaining with her native city.|$|R
5000|$|The substantial, <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> {{is thought}} to have been erected [...] for Thomas Beevor Steele, a Brisbane {{insurance}} agent. Steele acquired title to the Laurel Avenue site in March 1900. At this time the property comprised two blocks totalling nearly one and a half acres, stretching from what is now Laurel Avenue to the Brisbane River. A £950 mortgage on the property taken out in September 1900 may have helped finance construction of the house, which was named Waterton. Steele, who previously resided at Indooroopilly, is first listed as resident at Chelmer in the 1901 Queensland Post Office Directory, suggesting that the house was constructed by this date. In February 1901, a Brisbane Courier newspaper article identified the Steele family as residing at [...] "Waterton", Chelmer, a name that remained in use during its earliest years. In design and decorative elements, the house also suggests an early 20th century date of construction.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the urban {{transformation}} of Cotia, located in {{the periphery of the}} metropolis, aims the documentation of the region urban development, starting on the 18 century, and its analysis, taking São Paulo city as reference. This analysis was elaborated from the social-economics and spatial relations of the urban development, from the city adequation to the metropolitan area planning, from the linearity that the Raposo Tavares highway imposes to the urban composition and the characteristics of the <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> condominiums determined to the territory. Induced, Cotia has splitted, and started to tell two stories that shouldn't be parallel, what worsened the discriminatory process among the different income groups. The inventory of the condominiums, the closeds residencies nuclei and the land divisions, the reading of the social exclusion and the critic to the ruling planning were fundamental to the making of this work...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} addresses delineations {{of gender}} roles, agency, {{and change in}} a modern urban women’s residence in north India. It explores the social relations of residents in a women’s hostel where the shaping of special community creates empowermenf through self-reflection, interaction, and negotiation, yet where also reside tensions, paradoxes, and constraints, in the merging and interplay of traditional values and those of modernity. The hostel in which the research reported here was carried out is a <b>middle-class</b> <b>residence</b> which resembles, in physical appearance and layout, a student dormitory/residence at a North American or British university, or a YWCA. It offers {{a place to live}} for women who come from afar and who cannot see renting an apartment in the city as an option. It is unaffiliated with hospital, school, university, nurs-ing, or occupational programming, and it is not similar to boarding school residence. 1 Such a residence in India offers a locale for women to develop their working and social lives. I learned about its ability to generate change, yet also its institutional place in the patriarchal structure of the society, where modernity and tradition intertwine. This research has raised the following questions. What {{does it mean to be}} “single” and a woman in India? Why do women come here from all over the country? What does it offer, and what are the cultural challenges of the institution? How is it coloured by the metropolis, and how do the women use the city to develop and change as people? Why can’t a woman live alone in the city? How do residents in the hostel meet, mingle, and grow, while sharing personal and emotional dilemmas? Do they feel certain physical limits...|$|E
5000|$|The {{entirety}} of the Jersey Shore region was significantly affected by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The devastating {{effect of the}} storm surge on property adjacent to the beach resulted in substantial cost to the reinsurance industry which has since advocated avoidance of rebuilding closely packed <b>middle-class</b> <b>residences</b> or flimsy commercial structures adjacent to the beach. It is felt insuring property in the area may be impossible if a configuration of buildings is constructed which have a high probability of suffering massive damage in future storms. The hurricane reached up to 74 mph. Hurricane Sandy's pure kinetic energy for storm surge and wave destruction potential reached a 5.8 out of 6 on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's scale. Storm surges reached 14 ft above average low tide. The storm left an estimated 7.5 million people without power. However, many citizens in NJ did not expect the storm to {{be as bad as}} it was. Most {{of the people who were}} affected by the storm expected it to be like the previous storm, Hurricane Irene. The Barrier Islands were especially damaged, leaving dozens of homes completely washed away. Many iconic places from [...] "The Shore" [...] were also damaged due to Hurricane Sandy, such as: the Belmar boardwalk, Casino Pier and Funtown Pier. The night of the hurricane, families were told to evacuate the Barrier Island and to leave behind their homes, little did they know, some of them would be losing their entire home and even some loved ones. Even though its only been four years since the hurricane hit, many neighborhoods will never be rebuilt [...]|$|R
