For the <b>moored</b> <b>vessels,</b> oscillation {{is one of the most}} important parameters. The elastic behaviour of the cables, made of various fibers, is difficult to determine, because it depends on material, composition, loading history and environmental conditions. The natural oscillation period of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> depends on the vessels displacement, number, type and loading of the lines. Several cases were studied, in order to determine the influence of the variables on the oscillation and vibration modes of vessels and basins. The oscillation period of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> was determined with the module „Surging of a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> ” implemented in the demo version of CEDAS.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of Fast Ferry public transport in the Netherlands a number of complaints about wake wash induced hindrance onboard <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> appeared. It was already possible to calculate the wake wash characteristics of fast sailing vessels, the progress of these waves in a waterway and their effect on <b>moored</b> <b>vessels.</b> This paper describes the full scale tests carried out to develop the missing relation between the wash induced motions of a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> and the hindrance thereof. Many different combinations of moored ships, passing ships and shore configurations have been realised. An expert panel scored the hindrance due to the motions of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> A guideline for maximum ship motions is developed from the results. With this guideline, it can be determined prior to {{the introduction}} of a new innovative vessel with reasonable accuracy if its wake wash will remain within acceptable limits. © 2009 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|R

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> stationkeeping operations in pack ice, {{on the basis of}} full scale experience with the Kulluk in the Beaufort Sea. As part of this work, a data base which documents full scale ice load levels on <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> has been significantly extended, and now includes almost 700 individual ice loading events. In addition, more operationally oriented information about ice management support activities and levels of risk (alerts) has been blended with the load data, for each event. Various scatter plots of expected ice loads in managed pack ice conditions are presented. Data relating to the effect of different levels of ice management support on load and risk levels is also included. The implications of this information are outlined in relation to various <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> system operations in Grand Banks pack ice conditions. It is shown that <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> operations in the type of pack ice conditions periodically encountered on the Grand Banks should be less difficult than is currently perceived, provided systems with reasonable in-ice capabilities and adequate levels of ice management support are used.

It is an innovative mooring system using vacuum pads with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m Large Rhine <b>vessel</b> <b>moored</b> directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units.

40|$|Vessel {{stationkeeping}} {{in moving}} pack ice {{is an important}} issue for floating production systems that are being considered for use in ice-covered waters. In order to be effective, {{it is important that the}} loads generated by moving pack ice are within the range of the capabilities of their mooring systems. To better understand loads on <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> in ice, the full-scale data from the Kulluk, which was a floating drilling unit used in the Beaufort Sea, were analyzed and summarized for different conditions. A new two-dimensional model of icestructure interaction was applied and compared to the full-scale Kulluk data. One base case was selected and a good correlation was obtained by adjusting the mechanical properties of the pack ice in the numerical model. The analysis shows that this model, with suitable calibration, can be used to predict loads on a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> over a wide range of pack ice conditions, such as those found in the Grand Banks of Canada, the Pechora Sea or offshore Sakhalin in Russia.

40|$|Mooring line Quasi-Static {{analysis}} of <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> is vastly used for engineering designs, {{as a substitute}} to the numerical simulation of dynamic mooring analysis. Yet, the level of validity {{of the results of}} quasi-static analysis is a matter of discussion. In the present study, the validation of the assumptions behind the quasi-static {{analysis of}} <b>mooring</b> <b>vessels</b> is examined with application of a dynamic model for a number of <b>vessel</b> sizes and <b>mooring</b> configurations. The results show that in the moderate wave condition (wave height less than 1. 2 m), the main assumption of not applicability of wave forces in prediction of line forces is acceptable; the differences being less than 5 percent. However, distribution of forces between spring and breasting lines is not coincided with the anticipation of response of the system. The parametric study shows that the critical condition for line tensions is not necessarily corresponding to the exact coincidence of directions of wind, current and wave forces. Also, the forces exerted on fenders in some cases are maxima in direction, different from the perpendicular to the vessel. This means that the mooring line arrangement considerably dictates the distribution of the tension in mooring lines and reaction in fenders. Hence, the accuracy of the quasi-static analysis highly depends on the mooring lines configuration...|$|R
