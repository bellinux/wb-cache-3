40|$|Abstract- Aluminum {{and copper}} metal {{structures}} with sub micron dimension {{are widely used}} in semiconductor devices. Precise cutting of these <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> {{is one of the}} fundamental requirements in VLSI Circuit Edit technology. Cutting of these sub micron <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> should ensure good electrical isolation while maintaining nil / minimal damage to closely spaced adjacent metal structures. In this experimental work, both focused ion beam (FIB) technology and focused Laser beam technology have been explored. Relative merits and demerits of these technologies have been discussed. Laser beam assisted technology is found to be viable for cutting <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> if spacing between <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> is greater than two microns. Focused ion beam assisted technology is found to be quite effective in cutting metal structures when spacing between <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> is less than a micron...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for formation of <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> for electronic devices, and for reduction of resistivity in such <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> is proposed. In the technique, the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are formed in trenches by using functional liquids containing metal nanoparticles. The trenches are constructed on a plastic substrate by imprint of a patterned mold. When the whole {{surface of the}} plastic substrate {{is covered with a}} hydrophobic film, the hydrophobic property disappears only in the trenches due to the pressing process of the imprint, and thus the functional liquid automatically accumulates into the trenches. When the metallic functional liquid is modified with tween- 20 (polyoxyethylene- 20), <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> with a width of 10  μm are formed by capillary effect. The resistivity of such <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> can be lowered to the order of 10 ^  Ω[*]cm by exposing them to hydrogen atoms generated in vacuum by catalytic cracking of hydrogen molecules with heated tungsten wires...|$|R

40|$|In {{applications}} such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) or photovoltaic cells a homogenous voltage distribution in the large anode layer needs to be ensured by including a metal grid with a transparent conductor layer. To ensure sufficient conductivity, relatively thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are used, which increases the risk of electrical shorts between the anode and the cathode. For this reason an insulating layer is needed on top of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> The thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> limit the choice of deposition method, since some methods such as spin coating require smooth surfaces and cannot be used for applying the insulator. Here, a spray coating process has been studied as a potential alternative deposition method to create thin resistive layers on rough surfaces. Spray coating and Joule heating has been used for the alignment of insulator films on printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> It was demonstrated that spray coating can be used to cover the printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> which have high peaks on them. The spray coating forms electrically insulating layers even though the film thickness is less than the height of the peaks. The leakage current through the dielectric was on the order of 10 - 6 A/cm 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} some high-redshift QSO {{absorption}} systems that reveal only the H I Lyman series lines at wavelengths {{visible from the}} ground may be {{a new class of}} ultra-high-ionization <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> systems, with <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> in the far-UV region which is now being explored with satellites. At high temperatures or in intense radiation fields metal systems will not show the usual C IV absorption, and O VI will become the most prominent metal absorber. At still higher ionization, O VI also becomes weak, and the strongest <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are from Ne VIII, Mg X, and Si XII, which have doublets in the range 500 - 800 angstrom. Hence very high ionization metal systems will not show <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> in existing spectra. Recent X-ray observations show that galaxy halos contain hot gas, so we predict that far-UV spectra of QSOs will also show this gas...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} several geometric {{methods for}} dividing an irregular mesh into pieces of roughly equal size with few interconnecting edges. All these methods {{are based on}} cutting a mesh with a line (in two dimensions) or a hyperplane (in any dimension). <b>Line</b> <b>cuts</b> have often been used in practice, but their quality varies widely. Until now, no theory has existed to predict the effectiveness of any line-cut algorithm. We make two main contributions: First, we give rigorous (and tight) bounds {{on the quality of}} <b>line</b> <b>cuts</b> for meshes of bounded aspect ratio in terms of a parameter we call grading that measures the nonuniformity of the mesh. Our bound on <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> quality differs from the known bound on circle cut quality by a factor that grows only as the 1 =d power of the logarithm of the mesh grading. Second, we give an upper bound on the quality of an exact 50 : 50 <b>line</b> <b>cut.</b> This is the first proof of a cut size guarantee for any exact bisection induced by a single geometric cut.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we develop}} a novel process {{to fill the}} {{interline}} space with air (dielectric constant = 1). A silicon wafer, whose face is downward, patterned with <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> {{is placed on the}} top of another silicon wafer coated with dry polyimide. Hydrogen silsesquioxanes (HSQ), FOx- 16, is diluted and trickled through the slit between the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> and the polyimide. Then the HSQ forms an ultrathin liquid layer on the dry polyimide and contacts with the top of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> After the liquid HSQ becomes dry, the air gap is formed. The dry polyimide has good adhesion to silicon substrate but not to the dry FOx- 16, so we can separate the polyimide from the dry FOx- 16 and get the air gap. The liquid property of HSQ and its high selective adsorption between the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> and the polyimide are utilized to form the air gap.

40|$|The {{dielectric}} constant of a metallization {{system can be}} reduced drastically by introduction of air gaps between <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> It was {{the objective of the}} activities reported here to demonstrate processes that allow to incorporate air gaps in single-metal layer structures. Two different methods were used for this purpose: Philips favoreda "sacrificial materials" approach where the dielectric material between the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> was removed underneath a porous hard mask layer by thermal decomposition; the air gaps of Infineon's "close-off" approach were etched between <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> by RIE and subsequently sealed at the top by a novel selective oxide deposition. In both cases,air gaps could be created successfully and reproducibly. The Philips air gaps are less than 150 nm wide. Preliminary electrical measurements indicate that the capacitance between adjacent <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> indeed can be reduced to a value that is compatible with the requirements of the ITRS roadmap for the 45 nm node. The reliability performancewill be evaluated in the remaining part of the project...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>line</b> delay {{has become}} {{increasingly}} important for ULSIdevices. Numerous expressions and software tools {{have been developed to}} describe interconnect delay {{as a function of the}} geometry and layout. Although many of these formulas have line length effects, this has not been explored in depth. Most software tools are either geared towards circuit designers, or involve more complex and CPU-intensive 3 -D modeling. In this work, PISCES (a 2 -D device simulator) was used to extract metal capacitance per unit length. We extend this approach for various lengths by creating a ladder network of the RC components and simulating in SPICE, or using simple closed-form Elmore delay equations. A new key result is that there are optimum <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> width/space for a fixed pitch and height/space ratios that are metal length dependent. For <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> shorter than about 15 OOim, it is better to have narrower <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> and for lengths less than 5 OOim, shrinking metal height is desireable because the penalty in resistance is more than compensated by the decrease in capacitance. For longer lines, the time delay is dominated by resistance, and wider, taller lines are better. Increasing metal spacing or reducing dielectric constant were beneficial for both long and short <b>metal</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of pattern-dependent charging during interlevel dielectric (ILD) deposition in high-density plasmas {{reveal that the}} initial conformality of the ILD film {{plays a crucial role}} in <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> charging up and the subsequent degradation to the buried gate oxide to which the <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> is connected. Line charging occurs when the top dielectric is thick enough to prevent tunneling currents while the sidewall dielectric thickness still allows tunneling currents to flow to the metal line; the differential charging of the sidewalls, which induces the latter currents, is caused by electron shading. The results suggest that charging can be reduced by depositing a more conformal ILD film around the <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> and/or by increasing the ability of the film surface to dissipate charge...|$|R
