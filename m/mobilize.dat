40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mobilization of}} reinforcement tension within geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures at working stress and at large soil strains. Fully-mobilized reinforcement tension is assumed in most current design methods for the internal stability of GRS structures. In these methods the <b>mobilized</b> reinforcement tensile load {{is assumed to be}} equal to <b>mobilized</b> horizontal soil forces computed using active earth pressure theory. However, comparison with reinforcement tension loads measured in the field has shown that this approach is conservative (excessively safe) by as much as a factor of two. This observation has prompted the current study in which stress data obtained from a numerical study and two instrumented large-scale GRS retaining walls were used {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>mobilized</b> reinforcement tensile load and <b>mobilized</b> soil shear strength. The results show that the ratio of reinforcement tensile load and <b>mobilized</b> soil shear strength is not constant Only when the average <b>mobilized</b> soil shear strength exceeds 95 %, is reinforcement tensile capacity <b>mobilized</b> significantly. Nevertheless, less than 30 % of reinforcement strength is <b>mobilized</b> when the average <b>mobilized</b> soil shear strength reaches peak soil shear capacity. These results help explain why current design methods lead to computed reinforcement loads that are very high compared to measured loads under operational conditions...|$|R

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom.

Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion.

30|$|During these periods, the {{recession}} coefficient increased greatly, reflecting an inability of aquifers to properly recharge, particularly in 1983. The recession coefficient {{moved in the}} opposite direction to the volume of water <b>mobilized</b> by the aquifers annually.

This volume varied from 0.076  km 3 per year in 1983 to 0.98  km 3 per year in 1985. Since 1985, the volume of water <b>mobilized</b> has remained low, particularly during 1993 characterized by the lowest volume.

5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to <b>mobilize</b> national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

40|$|Forty-seven {{peripheral}} {{blood stem cell}} (PBSC) collections were carried out on patients <b>mobilized</b> with chemotherapy and 63 on patients <b>mobilized</b> with chemotherapy plus G-CSF (Filgrastim), using the Fresenius AS 104 cell separator and a novel automated PBSC collection protocol. As expected, cell yields were significantly higher in the series <b>mobilized</b> using chemotherapy plus G-CSF. The low platelet and red blood cell contamination permitted freezing of the apheresis product without further manipulation, other than plasma removal in both series. In patients <b>mobilized</b> with chemotherapy we obtained a MNC and a hemopoietic progenitor (CFU-GM, BFU-e, and CD 34 + cells) collection efficiency comparable or superior to those reported by Bender (1992) with the Baxter CS 3000 Plus after mobilization with cyclophosphamide. A significant decrease in MNC, BFU-e, and CD 34 + cell collection efficiency was found in patients <b>mobilized</b> with chemotherapy plus G-CSF compared to those obtained in patients <b>mobilized</b> with chemotherapy alone.

5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium.

However, the repopulating function of human cells <b>mobilized</b> with AMD 3100 has not been characterized in comparison to cells <b>mobilized</b> with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the same donor. Therefore, healthy donors were leukapheresed 4 hours after injection with AMD 3100; after 10 days of drug clearance the same donor was <b>mobilized</b> with G-CSF, allowing a paired comparison of repopulation by <b>mobilized</b> cells. Transplantation of mononuclear cells (MNC) or purified CD 34 + cells was compared at limiting dilution into NOD/SCID mice. Human AMD 3100 -mobilized MNC possessed enhanced repopulating frequency in comparison to G-CSF-mobilized MNC from paired donors, and purified CD 34 + progenitors were at least as efficient as the G-CSF <b>mobilized</b> cells. The frequencies of NOD/SCID repopulating cells (SRC) were 1 SRC in 8. 7 × 106 AMD 3100 -mobilized MNC compared to 1 SRC in 29. 0 × 106 G-CSF-mobilized MNC, and 1 SRC in 1. 2 × 105 AMD 3100 -mobilized CD 34 + cells compared to 1 SRC in 1. 8 × 105 G-CSF-mobilized CD 34 + cells. Hematopoietic differentiation of transplanted progenitors was similar after AMD 3100 or G-CSF-mobilization.
