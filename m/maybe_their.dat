2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It was filmed on April 5, 1990 using live concert footage from Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. In addition to the audience for the sold-out show, the filming reportedly drew an additional 3,000 fans. The video premiered during the tour's first date at the Tacoma Dome, projected on three screens prior to Jackson appearing on stage. It was later debuted on MTV and other music channels in August. The video uses an [...] "in concert" [...] theme, in a similar concept to other hard rock and heavy metal music videos of the era, being a departure from her heavily choreographed videos with various settings. Spliced footage of a black panther is shown throughout the video. Jackson explained, [...] "Black panthers fascinate me. They've become an obsession. During filming, we used a black panther who actually attacked his trainer. Don't ask me why, but I was never fearful. I feel a strange rapport with panthers. They've become an inner symbol. Maybe it's their beauty, <b>maybe</b> <b>their</b> danger, maybe the poetry of their movement. It's as though their strength protects me." [...] It was later included on the Rhythm Nation Compilation and Design of a Decade video release.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{called it}} [...] "the {{best of the}} [...] career so far". Rob Mackie of The Guardian also said that [...] "what makes this such a {{stand-out}} is hard to put your finger on– it just feels like an absorbing and tense two hours where everyone is absolutely {{on top of their}} job and a comfortable fit in their roles." [...] Geoff Andrew of Time Out London expressed that [...] "the film exerts a grip from start to end". Richard Corliss of Time magazine chose the film as the best of the year and said that [...] "after two decades of being brilliant on the movie margins, the Coens are ready for their closeup, and <b>maybe</b> <b>their</b> Oscar". Paul Arendt of the BBC gave the film a full mark and said that it [...] "doesn't require a defense: it is a magnificent return to form". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "for formalists – those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design – it's pure heaven." [...] Both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At The Movies gave the film five stars, making No Country for Old Men the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2007. Both praised the film for its visual language and suspense, David commenting that [...] "Hitchcock wouldn't have done the suspense better".|$|E

Of course, until we see that the peasants are really in earnest, and intend to fight to the last, it would be madness for any of us to take any part in the matter; for we should be risking not only life but the fortunes of our families, and <b>maybe</b> <b>their</b> lives, too.
