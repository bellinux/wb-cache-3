5|$|Nash Senior was {{a member}} of a group of 600 police who went on strike in 1923 for better wages but was {{dismissed}} from the force and required to find another livelihood. Nash Senior went into the hotel business, firstly in Melbourne before eventually <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> family to Tasmania in 1929 to run the hotel at Parattah.|$|E
5|$|Puck (Mark Salling) wants Finn (Cory Monteith) to {{join him}} in <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> pool-cleaning {{business}} to California. Finn demurs, but later broaches the possibility to his fiancée Rachel (Lea Michele) as an alternative to New York. She is aghast, and says she needs him with her in New York; he replies that she needs to be sure she loves him for who he is, not who she wants him to be.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{began his}} legal career at {{international}} law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where he worked}} from 1961 to 1967. He was highly regarded {{at the law firm}} and would most likely have been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He became {{a professor of law at}} the University of Virginia in 1967, <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> family to Charlottesville.|$|E
50|$|Although {{best known}} for his paintings, Kāne also {{produced}} limited-edition bronze sculpture and other three-dimensional works besides the Hōkūle‘a, which has been called <b>his</b> <b>moving</b> sculpture. <b>His</b> monumental bronze figure, The Young Kamehameha stands in Wailea, Maui.|$|R

5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E
5|$|The {{siliquae}} in the Hoard {{were struck}} mainly at Western mints in Gaul and Italy. It is unknown {{whether this is}} because coins from further East rarely reached Britain through trade, or because the Eastern mints rarely struck siliquae. The production of coins seems to follow {{the location of the}} Imperial court at the time; for instance, the concentration of Trier coins is much greater after 367, perhaps associated with Gratian <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> court to Trier.|$|E
5|$|The song's lyrics {{were written}} by Cyrus and Casey Beathard. Cyrus {{discussed}} Home at Last {{in an interview with}} Calvin Gilbert of CMT News in which he said the song was about children growing up and moving on, from his own experience of <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> family to Los Angeles to help Miley with her acting and singing career.|$|E

5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
5|$|Bond again {{encounters}} Goodhead in Venice {{where he}} is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.|$|E
5|$|His decade-long reign {{over the}} Kievan Rus' {{was marked by}} rapid {{expansion}} into the Volga River valley, the Pontic steppe, and the Balkans. By {{the end of his}} short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> capital in 969 from Kiev (modern-day Ukraine) to Pereyaslavets (identified as the modern village of Nufăru, Romania) on the Danube. In contrast with his mother's conversion to Christianity, Sviatoslav remained a staunch pagan all of his life. Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his three sons, resulting in two of them being killed.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, when Ernest was six, Henry Shackleton gave up {{his life}} as a {{landowner}} to study medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> family into the city. Four years later, the family moved again, from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London. Partly this was in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about their Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Secretary for Ireland, in 1882.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} of action that {{forfeited}} the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 1862, Cox began <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> Kanawha Division toward Washington as {{reinforcement}} for Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Exceptions to Cox's {{orders were}} the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry and two regiments of Ohio infantry, which {{remained in the}} area for defensive purposes. The three regiments moved to Kanawha Falls in what is now south central West Virginia, {{at the beginning of the}} Kanawha River—which flows to the Ohio River. They were put under the command of Colonel Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn. Thus, the two battalions of 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry were reunited, with Colonel John C. Paxton commanding the cavalry regiment. Confederate leaders soon learned of the force reduction, and made plans to drive the Union army out of the Kanawha Valley.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1863, Longstreet {{abandoned}} the siege and began <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> forces north {{to rejoin the}} Army of Northern Virginia. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent {{in pursuit of the}} retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the Somerton Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.|$|E

5|$|Pulsford {{established}} a successful business {{with his father}} as commission agents in Yorkshire before <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> interests to New South Wales in 1883. There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of the Free Trade and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he {{was appointed to the}} Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when {{he was elected to the}} Senate. An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{devoted his}} support {{to a variety}} of causes, {{including}} a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, <b>moving</b> <b>his</b> own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia {{for at least five years}} be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.|$|E
