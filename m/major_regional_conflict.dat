The Plural NRC model, PaMM, is an integer programming model and solution procedure that develops deployment schedules for active duty Army combat divisions to two nearly simultaneous MRCs without perfect information regarding the second NRC. PaMM develops the deployment schedules using a sequential heuristic: It first solves the optimal deployment schedules for a single NRC, fixes all movement that occurs before the hypothesized start date of a second NRC, and solves the resulting problem for both NRCs. The sequential technique is robust: Using a hypothetical scenario where all divisions for the first NRC are required within the first 30 days, PaMM is run six times, varying the time difference between the start dates of the NRCs form 10 to 60 days.

This regional violence is not dissociated from international politics.

Responding to this situation, a plethora of academic and artistic output concerning Middle Eastern terrorism has emerged from the West. These efforts, especially in English-language fiction, have been mainly reductive and simplistic and have contributed to furthering an atmosphere of mistrust and Islamophobia that emerged after 9 / 11.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the possible implications to global maritime interests {{posed by the}} growing international proliferation of advanced sea mines, and examines the role of NATO's mine countermeasures (MCM) forces in countering this threat in the post-Cold War security environment. It is argued that, given the Iraqi mining success during the Gulf War, the current global proliferation of sophisticated sea mines, and deficiencies in the international laws which govern their use, mine warfare will present a growing threat to vulnerable Western nations into the next century. Consequently, NATO's mine countermeasure forces will have {{a prominent role in}} future Alliance or UN-mandated out-of-area naval contingencies, ranging from counter-terrorism operations to <b>major</b> <b>regional</b> <b>conflicts,</b> and will be called upon to provide a credible MCM capability to protect Alliance and coalition naval forces, secure vital sea lines of communication (SLOCs), and ensure unimpeded maritime freedom of the seas prescribed under international law. NATO's capability to meet these challenges will depend largely on its ability to reorient its focus toward the requirements necessary to train and maintain a first-rate MCM rapid deployment force. As a leader within NATO, the United States Navy must assume the lead in forging multinational transatlantic MCM forces capable of dealing with any global mining contingency. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

In {{many parts of the}} world today the continuing growth of commercial air traffic is running up against limits brought on by overuse of aviation resources. Air corridors in Europe and on transoceanic air routes are operating at maximum capacity. Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) are working these challenges on two levels—near-term incremental improvements and long-term visionary changes. Each country has a CAA; ours being the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Near-term solutions focus on better utilization of resources such as air space and frequency spectrum and improved performance of air traffic control facilities. Long-term visionary changes, such as free flight, could fundamentally change the current civil aviation business process model. CAA policies and standards are driving near-term improvements and migration toward long-term objectives. This initiative is referred as Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM). Implementation of the U. S. military’s vision, Global Reach/Global Power, requires the ability to rapidly deploy armed forces to <b>major</b> <b>regional</b> <b>conflicts</b> anywhere in the world, and to sustain these forces for as long as it takes to resolve these conflicts. To achieve this goal and accomplish rapid deployments while at the same time minimizing costs, the Air Force has adopted a solution that makes extensive use of CNS/ATM. The Air Force calls its initiative Global Air Traffic Management (GATM). Air Force aircraft equipped with GATM avionics will be able to use CNS/ATM capabilities such as reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM), 8. 33 kHz data links, automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B), and global communication networks. These capabilities make possible improved flight safety, lower fuel costs, and quicker turn times.
