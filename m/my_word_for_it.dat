500|$|The Democratic {{press was}} unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and {{attacked}} {{him for not}} publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him [...] "General Mum". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, [...] "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." [...] John de Ziska, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to [...] "get rid of" [...] Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: [...] "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he will sit {{the remainder of his}} days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy." [...] This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up your mind to kill someone and then to kill them, but take <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> it only takes a second'".|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Welsh {{described}} the novel he said: [...] "I think I’m {{going to call}} it Skag Boys: “skag” is <b>my</b> favourite <b>word</b> <b>for</b> heroin. <b>It’s</b> set before they’re into heroin and investigates how the main characters become junkies, the family dynamics, the anxieties of young men. A lot of the fringe characters become more prominent".|$|R
60|$|But {{no doubt}} {{there are other reasons}} why the novel should not finally be of the length of Hamlet, and I must not let my enthusiasm for the novelette carry me too far, or, rather, bring me up too short. I am {{disposed}} to dwell upon it, I suppose, because it has not yet shared the favor which the novella and the novel have enjoyed, and because until somebody invents a way <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to the public it cannot prosper like the one-number story or the serial. I should like to say as <b>my</b> last <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> here that I believe there are many novels which, if stripped of their padding, would turn out to have been all along merely novelettes in disguise.|$|R

60|$|I exaggerate my own defects. The reader {{must not}} take <b>my</b> own <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> nor believe me {{altogether}} {{changed from the}} young man who once hoped strenuously, and struggled not so much amiss. Frostier heads than mine have gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new warmth, and been newly happy. Life, however, it must be owned, has come to rather an idle pass with me. Would my friends like to know what brought it thither? There is one secret,--I have concealed it all along, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one foolish little secret, which possibly may {{have had something to do}} with these inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with the unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless glance towards the future. Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing for a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these three white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a crow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and quite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about. But it rises to my throat; so let it come.|$|R
6000|$|Bold {{took his}} leave, {{and got out}} of the room as quickly as he could, {{inwardly}} denouncing his friend Tom Towers as a prig and a humbug. [...] "I know he wrote those articles," [...] said Bold to himself. [...] "I know he got his information from me. He was ready enough to take <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> gospel when <b>it</b> suited his own views, and to set Mr Harding up before the public as an impostor on no other testimony than my chance conversation; but when I offer him real evidence opposed to his own views, he tells me that private motives are detrimental to public justice! Confound his arrogance! What is any public question but a conglomeration of private interests? What is any newspaper article but an expression of the views taken by one side? Truth! it takes an age to ascertain the truth of any question! The idea of Tom Towers talking of public motives and purity of purpose! Why, it wouldn't give him a moment's uneasiness to change his politics to-morrow, if the paper required it." ...|$|R
500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> ever. <b>It</b> was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|R

6000|$|Before I {{relate the}} history of the {{transactions}} of my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, I must here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The matter is this: Just before we weighed anchor and set sail, there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which had like to have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time the courageous Capitan, taking two of the most refractory prisoners, laid them in irons threatening, as they were concerned in the former disorders, so have them hanged in England for running away with the ship. This frightened some of the rest, as thinking the Captain would serve them in the same manner, though he seemed to give them good <b>word</b> <b>for</b> the present. But the mate having intelligence of this, mad me acquainted with their fears; so that to make them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their conspiracies I was obliged to go down, and pass <b>my</b> honour's <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> that upon their good behaviour, all that was past should be forgiven; in testimony of which, I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off; & themselves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an anchor that night, in which there was a calm; the two men that had been in irons stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons, and taking the ship's pinnace, not yet hauled up, ran away to their brother rogues. The next morning we sent the long-boat with men to pursue them, but all in vain; the mate, in revenge, would have demolished my little castle, burnt his furniture and destroyed their plantations, but having no orders <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he did not put it in execution. And thus there were five Englishmen in the island, which caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in the following manner: ...|$|R
