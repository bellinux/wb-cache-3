By revisiting previous well-established "gain-guiding" concepts, we investigate analytically and numerically the dispersion and confinement properties of guided modes that can be supported by this type of structures, by assuming realistic <b>dispersion</b> models and <b>parameters</b> for the material constituents. As key outcomes, we identify certain modes with specific polarization and symmetry that exhibit particularly desirable characteristics, in terms of quasi-real propagation constant and sub-wavelength confinement. Moreover, we elucidate the effects of <b>material</b> <b>dispersion</b> and <b>parameters,</b> and highlight the potential advantages by comparison with the previously studied gain-loss bi-layer configurations. Our results provide additional perspectives on light control in non-Hermitian optical systems, and may find potentially intriguing applicability to reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms.

40|$|SUMMARY. In the {{analysis}} of proportions often interest is in the estimation of the mean or the regression <b>parameters.</b> The <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> then {{plays the role of}} a nuisance parameter. However, in some instances, in Toxicology and other similar fields, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> or the intraclass correlation parameter is of primary interest. For example, in some binary-data situations the intraclass correlation is interpreted as ‘heritability of a dichotomous trait’. So, efficient and possibly robust estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> or the intraclass correlation is important. Marginal or conditional estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is difficult. So we consider joint estimation of the mean (regression) <b>parameters</b> and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter.</b> We consider joint estimation using quadratic estimating functions (QEEs) of Crowder (1987). By varying the coefficients of the QEEs we obtain five sets of estimating equations. We compare large sample relative efficiency of the five sets of estimates obtained by the QEE’s and the quasi-likelihood estimates with the maximum likelihood estimates. Estimated large sample relative efficiencies of these estimates are also compared for two real life data sets arising from biostatistical practices. These comparisons show that estimates, using optimal quadratic estimating functions of Crowder (1987) are highly efficient and are the best among all estimates investigated. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> of the negative binomial distribution for modeling motor vehicle collisions. The negative binomial distribution is widely used to model count data such as traffic crash data, which often exhibit low sample mean values and small sample sizes. Under such situations, the most commonly used methods for estimating the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter,</b> the method of moment and the maximum likelihood estimate, may become inaccurate and unstable. A bootstrapped maximum likelihood estimate is proposed to improve the estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter.</b> The proposed method combines the technique of bootstrap resampling with the maximum likelihood estimation method to obtain better estimates of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter.</b> The performance of the bootstrapped maximum likelihood estimate is compared with the method of moment and the maximum likelihood estimates through Monte Carlo simulations. To validate the simulation results, the methods are applied to observed data collected at 4 -legged unsignalized intersections in Toronto, Ont.

40|$|Negative Binomial (or Poisson-gamma) {{model has}} been used {{extensively}} by highway safety analysts because it can accommodate the over-dispersion, often exhibited in crash data. However, {{it has been reported}} in the literature that the maximum likelihood estimate of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> of NB models can be significantly affected when the data are characterized by small sample size and low sample mean. Given the important roles of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> in various types of highway safety analyses, {{there is a need to}} determine whether the bias could be potentially corrected or minimized. The objectives of this paper are to explore whether a systematic relationship exists between the estimated and true dispersion parameters; determine the bias as a function of the sample size and sample mean; and, develop a procedure for correcting the bias caused by these two conditions. For this purpose, simulated data were used to derive the relationship under the various combinations of sample mean, <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> and sample size, which encompass all simulation conditions performed in previous researches.

40|$|Generalized Threshold Model (GTM) is a {{non-linear}} {{time series}} model which generalizes the Threshold Autoregressive Model (TAR) {{to implement the}} idea of the Generalized Linear Model under the threshold time series framework.

40|$|Data in {{the form}} of counts or {{proportions}} arise in biology, biomedical, toxicology, epidemiology and other similar fields. These data often exhibit variation greater or smaller than predicted by a simple model, such as, a Poisson or a binomial model. Thus, in practice, a model having an over or under <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> might be necessary. This is an important parameter to estimate for making appropriate inferences regarding the mean or the regression parameters in analyzing count data or binary data. Also, in some instances the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> may be of interest in its own right. Several parametric or semi-parametric methods have been developed to estimate the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> in the analysis of binary data. In this thesis, I first conduct an extensive empirical investigation, by simulations, to study the properties, in terms of mean bias, standard deviation and mean square error, of twenty six different estimators of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> that exist in the literature. Of these twenty six estimators I recommend an estimator Q 2, based on optimal quadratic estimating equations for the mean and <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters.</b> Further, I derive an expression for a bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator (BCML) of this parameter using a beta-binomial model. A bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is also obtained for a regression situation. I then compare, by simulations, the BCML estimator, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, a double extended quasi-likelihood (DEQL) estimator proposed by Lee (2004) and the estimator Q 2. A toxicological data set from Paul (1982) and a medical data set from Otake and Prentice (1984) are analyzed. The simulation results and examples indicate that the BCML estimator performs well in terms of bias and efficiency in most instances. For count data we derive a first order BCML estimator using a two-parameter negative binomial model and a (DEQL) estimator for the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> for data involving only the mean and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters.</b> The bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is also derived for a negative binomial regression model. The BCML estimator, in case of a two-parameter model, is compared, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the ML estimator investigated by Piegorsch (1990), the moment and the maximum extended quasi-likelihood estimators investigated by Clark and Perry (1989), and the DEQL estimator. The BCML estimator works best in term of bias and efficiency properties in most instances.

In GLM’s sense <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> (φ) have effects at least in two ways, (i) for Exponential Dispersion Family, a good estimator of φ gives a good reflection of the variance of Y, (ii) although, the estimated β doesnt depend on φ, estimating β by maximizing log-likelihood bring us to Fisher’s information matrix that depends on its value. Thus, φ does affect the precision of β, (iii) a precise estimate of φ is important to get a good confidence interval for β.
