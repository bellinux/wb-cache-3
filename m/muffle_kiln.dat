50|$|Traditional kilns were wood firing, which {{required}} the pots {{to be protected}} in the glaze and luster firings by saggars or to be fired in a <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln.</b> Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use electric kilns.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buildings}} of the former potteries based on Pottery Road were acquired by a company called House of Marbles in 1990 for the manufacture and distribution of games and glassware. The company houses The Bovey Pottery Museum with many items produced at the Bovey Potteries on display. There are also three <b>muffle</b> <b>kilns</b> on the site that are recognised under the status of Statutory Ancient Monuments. They are one of just two sites left in the UK where <b>muffle</b> <b>kilns</b> (also referred to as enamel kilns) can be found, the other site being at Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent ...|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} centred on the Roslyn pottery. It {{contains}} two biscuit ovens and two larger glost ovens. In addition are two enamel kilns. A tandem compound steam engine by Marshall & Sons, of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire {{is in place}} but it is turned by an electric motor. The two <b>muffle</b> <b>kilns</b> came from elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The unfired ceramic ware {{was placed}} in saggars and then biscuit fired, before being glazed and again placed in saggars prior to being glost fired. Ware may then be decorated, and placed on {{refractory}} bats and fired again such as in a <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
50|$|The biscuitwares are glazed. They fired {{again in}} the bigger glost kilns- again they are placed in sealed saggars, items {{separated}} by kiln furniture such as stints, saddles and thimbles. The table-ware would then be decorated by transfers or by painting {{and placed in the}} <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transfer-printing {{of pottery}} was {{developed}} in the 1750s. There were two main methods, underglaze printing and overglaze. For overglaze printing, an engraved copper plate was prepared and rubbed with oil. The surplus oil was wiped off and an impression was taken onto thin paper. The oily print was then transferred to the glazed earthenware surface which was then dusted with finely ground pigment in the chosen colour. Excess powder was then removed and the ware was given a short firing in a <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln</b> to soften the glaze, burn off the oil and leave the printed image firmly bonded to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|In 1841 Bolton went to Europe {{where he}} saw masterpieces of art, mostly in Italy. Here he did many {{drawings}} and sketches {{of these and}} bought art for the family home. In 1842 Bolton returned to Pelham where he earnestly began his work in stained glass. Here he had a small shop {{at the rear of}} a house near the [...] "Pelham Priory," [...] the Gothic Revival family home in Pelham. The equipment he had to work with was sparse. He had a <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln,</b> which was used for firing his work after he painted details on the coloured glass. Bolton's younger brother John (1818-1898) assisted him in making and designing stained glass.|$|E
5000|$|The raw {{materials}} of pottery include clay, quartz and feldspar. These are mixed sieved and filtered to make slip, which is pressed {{to make a}} workable body.

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is an evaluation of the zeolitized facies of Campanian Ignimbrite as raw material for the production of lightweight expanded aggregates (LEA). A commercial product (Cab 70) was used as reference for this rock. Tests were carried out on “pure” samples or mixed with an industrial waste mud (DPM—Dried Polishing Mud) deriving from a porcelain stoneware tile polishing process. This mud contains SiC, a phase known to act as bloating enhancer. Raw materials were subjected tomineralogical (XRPD–RIR method) and chemical (XRF) analyses. Bloating upon heating was measured (Leitz heating microscope) on Cab 70, DPM and on three mixtures having the following Cab 70 /DPMratios: 85 / 15 (Mix 1); 70 / 30 (Mix 2); 50 / 50 (Mix 3). LEAproductionwas assessed both in static (<b>muffle</b> <b>kiln)</b> and in dynamic (rotating kiln) conditions by firing pellets, 3 – 8 mm in size, between 1220 – 1380 °C. The unit weight of the single particle was determined on fired and unfired products. All materials evidenced a decreasing density with temperature whereas the same parameter decreases with DPM increasing content. Cab 70 LEAs never dropped below 0. 90 g/cm 3, even at the highest temperature, whereas DPM LEAs range between 0. 86 g/cm 3 (at 1260 °C) and 0. 46 g/cm 3 (at 1380 °C). A direct but not linear relationship between DPMcontent and density was evidenced. Among the three mixtures,Mix 2 showed the lowest DPMcontent able to produce the strongest density reduction. To get LEAs with the same density the rotating kiln required temperatures generally 60 – 80 °C higher than those of the <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln.</b> This difference should be related to the different thermal insulation of the two systems during firing. Two sets of LEAs were massively produced in dynamic conditions from Cab 70 (at 1380 °C) and Mix 2 (at 1300 °C). These latter showed better technical performances in terms of unit weight of the single particle (0. 81 vs. 0. 98 g/cm 3), bulk unit weight (460 vs. 565 kg/m 3), water absorption coefficients (1. 4 vs. 5. 5 % after 24 h) and compressive strength of the particles (2. 9 vs. 0. 6 MPa). Differences in pore shape, dimension, abundance and spatial distribution were observed by SEMbetween the two sets. The technical features of these LEAs were comparable to some expanded clays, with similar grain size, commercialised in Italy. These results are worth interesting as they reveal new perspectives of application both for a rock characterized by a low exploitation cost and widely available in central-southern Italy, as well as for an industrial waste produced in high amount but not recycled at all...|$|E
40|$|The ceramic glazing {{techniques}} of vapour glazing, reduction lustre, Raku and fuming all require specialised firing conditions {{with the use}} of potentially hazardous kiln atmospheres and specialist kiln designs for their successful execution. The technique of reduction lustre is an ancient, highly decorative technique in which pigments or glazes containing reducible metal oxides such as copper, silver and bismuth are subjected to a reducing atmosphere which results in the formation of stable iridescent lustrous colour effects. Conventionally hydrocarbons are used to produce a reducing atmosphere, the combustion of which can lead to potentially high levels of CO. This research has concentrated on the technique of reduction lustre with the aim of producing a safe, environmentally friendly firing system. Reduction lustre effects were reproduced using a 100 litre down draft gas kiln designed and constructed for the purpose. A 40 litre electric kiln was modified for use with reducing atmospheres and a laboratory <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln</b> was also adapted to provide closely controlled firing conditions. Alternative reducing atmospheres were assessed, consisting of either 5 % H 2 in N 2 or hydrocarbon vapour in N 2 The former is reliable, safe, environmentally friendly and is recommended for studio pottery use. A theoretical design for a reduction lustre kiln incorporating a gas control system based on the use of a 5 % H 2 in N 2 gas mixture and a gas tight outer casing was developed. Thermoanalytical methods were used to investigate the reduction behaviour of raw materials, glazes and frits under different atmospheric conditions. Diffusional and topochemical models of reduction reactions occurring in a typical lustre glaze have been evaluated. In-glaze lustres reduce with thecharacteristics of diffusion processes. Water diffusion out of the glaze may be rate determining. Studies carried out using energy dispersive x-ray analysis andphoto electron spectroscopy show that lustres are associated with the presence of metallic copper, the actual colour being dependent on the surface concentration of the metal. The aesthetic results of the various firing methods developed were assessed using a perceptual study based on the use of a semantic differential test developed from a multiple sorting survey carried out using lustred tiles. The survey used both lustred tiles to represent a 2 -dimensional surface and lustred vases which represented a 3 -dimensional lustre glazed surface. The survey showed that statistically significant differences were observed between lustred ceramics fired in different systems, allowing comparisons to be made in an objective manner.

40|$|A urbanização e o crescente desenvolvimento das cidades, em especial da frota veicular e da expansão industrial, trazem como consequências uma série de perturbações ambientais como o desmatamento, a ameaça às populações silvestres e a contínua e crescente poluição atmosférica, do solo e das águas. Essa situação exige dos setores governamentais medidas reguladoras, preventivas e mitigadoras da poluição. Tillandsia recurvata (L.) L. é uma bromélia epífita, cujo corpo é principalmente formado por folhas cobertas por escamas capazes de absorver água e nutrientes diretamente do ar, sendo de ocorrência muito comum na área urbana de Londrina, crescendo sobre árvores e fiação elétrica e telefônica. A facilidade ao seu acesso estimulou a ideia de verificar se há um padrão de poluição por zinco em determinadas regiões de Londrina e se há viabilidade no uso dessa espécie para um sistema de biomonitoramento. Para isso foram escolhidas 5 regiões na área urbana de Londrina, sendo uma na área central (AC) com alto fluxo de veículos, 2 áreas industriais (IL e IS) e 2 residenciais (RC e RL), estas últimas consideradas como controle, sem indústrias e com baixo fluxo veicular. Em cada região foram determinados 5 pontos de amostragem e para cada ponto foram coletadas 3 amostras compostas de T. recurvata. Após as coletas as impurezas ou outros organismos foram manualmente removidos. A seguir as amostras foram submetidas à estufa de secagem até peso constante, carbonizadas e levadas à mufla para obtenção de cinzas. Amostras de 50 mg de cinzas foram mantidas em solução de ácido nítrico em tubos de polietileno por 72 horas em refrigerador. A quantidade de Zn presente nas cinzas foi determinada por espectrometria de absorção atômica por chama. A concentração de Zn nas plantas variou entre 0, 42 mg. g- 1 e 3, 8936 mg. g- 1 de matéria seca, atingindo níveis significativamente maiores que os citados como tóxicos para plantas cultivadas. A região central e as industriais apresentaram os valores mais altos de Zn, permitindo a associação do seu acúmulo em T. recurvata às emissões antrópicas, tanto industriais quanto veiculares. A possível corrosão de tanques que armazenam combustíveis tem sido apresentada como fonte de liberação de zinco para a atmosfera. Os resultados demonstraram o potencial de T. recurvata como acumuladora de Zn, podendo atuar como biomonitora da poluição do ar por metais e indicam, também, a necessidade do monitoramento da qualidade do ar em Londrina. The {{urbanization}} and {{the natural}} and constant growth of cities, especially vehicle and industry expansion, causes several environmental disturbances, such as deforestation, threat to wild populations, and the continuous atmospheric and environmental pollution. This situation demands from the government preventive and regulatory actions, as well as pollution mitigating. Tillandsia recurvata (L.) L. is an aerial epiphytic bromeliad that lives on trees or telephone wiring. Its body is formed mainly by linear leaves profusely covered with absorptive trichomes, that take out nutrients directly from the atmosphere. This capability has proposed the use of epiphytic plants as air pollution biomonitors. T. recurvata is very common and abundant in Londrina {{and for this reason}} this species was selected to carry out a monitoring study of air pollution by zinc. In this study, five sites from different areas were chosen to monitor air pollution by zinc, based on the vehicular traffic variation as well as the presence of industries. Two sites were set up in residential areas with light traffic flow, one site was set up in the central area where the traffic flow is heavy and two other sites in the industrial areas. For every site 5 points were determined for sample collection. Three composite samples per site were collected from the tree branches at 1, 5 to 2, 5 m from the ground, each composed by two or three individuals. Prior to chemical analyses, the samples were manually cleaned by removing extraneous materials and oven dried at 70 °C until reaching constant weight. After this procedure, the samples were placed to <b>muffle</b> <b>kiln</b> to produce the ashes. Fifty mg of the ashes were accurately weighed and kept in the refrigerator in polystyrene test tubes with nitric acid (HNO 3) for 72 hours. The solution was filtered and submitted to determination of zinc by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The Zn concentration ranged between 0, 4255 mg. g- 1 to 3, 8936 mg. g- 1, reaching levels significantly higher than those listed as toxic to grown plants. The obtained data also showed that the residential sites presented lower concentration for Zn and the highest concentrations were observed at the central area, where there is a higher vehicular traffic, what can be associated to the presence of anthropogenic emission sources. The possible deterioration of the vehicle’s fuel tanks migth contributes to release Zn to the atmosphere. The results indicated a promising potential of these species as biomonitors of air pollution as well as the need for monitoring the quality of the air in Londrina...|$|E
