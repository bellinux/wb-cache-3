The detection (DetT) and difference (DiffF) thresholds were determined in 4 different conditions defined by a combination of two factors, each involving two variables: a nose clip (with or without) and the tasting temperature (7 C or 15 C). Forty non-trained panelists participated in this study. Thresholds were determined using two-alternative forced-choice (2 -AFC) tests in ascending concentration series. Individual thresholds were calculated using the Best Estimate Threshold (BET) method. An increase in tasting temperature induced a decrease in the DetT and Difff, while the use of a nose clip led to an increase in both thresholds. A hierarchical cluster analysis evidenced three homogeneous subsets of subjects with contrasting sensitivity profiles: subsets 1 (n = 7) and 2 (n = 9) were characterized by high and low DetT and Diffr values, respectively, for all conditions, while a larger third subset (n = 24) included subjects with <b>medium</b> <b>thresholds</b> values that varied from one condition to another.

To achieve these aims, two nights of sleep were recorded simultaneously with polysomnography (PSG), two activity monitors, and a partial-PSG system in a sleep laboratory. Agreement with PSG was evaluated epoch by epoch and with summary measures including total sleep time (TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). All of the devices had high agreement rates for identifying sleep and wake, but the partial-PSG system was the best, with an agreement of 91. 6 % +/- 5. 1 %. Attheir best thresholds, the sleep/wake monitor (<b>medium</b> <b>threshold,</b> 87. 7 % +/- 7. 6 %) and the energy expenditure monitor (very low threshold, 86. 8 % +/- 8. 6 %) had similarly high rates of agreement.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{important}} signaling molecule that regulates many physiological processes in plants. One {{of the most important}} regulatory mechanisms of NO is S-nitrosylation-the covalent attachment of NO to cysteine residues. Although the involvement of cysteine S-nitrosylation in the regulation of protein functions is well established, its substrate specificity remains unknown. Identification of candidates for S-nitrosylation and their target cysteine residues is fundamental for studying the molecular mechanisms and regulatory roles of S-nitrosylation in plants. Several experimental methods that are based on the biotin switch have been developed to identify target proteins for S-nitrosylation. However, these methods have their limits. Thus, computational methods are attracting considerable attention for the identification of modification sites in proteins. Using GPS-SNO version 1. 0, a recently developed S-nitrosylation site-prediction program, a set of 16, 610 candidate proteins for S-nitrosylation containing 31, 900 S-nitrosylation sites was isolated from the entire Arabidopsis proteome using the <b>medium</b> <b>threshold.</b> In the compartments "chloroplast," "CUL 4 -RING ubiquitin ligase complex," and "membrane" more than 70 % of the proteins were identified as candidates for S-nitrosylation. The high number of identified candidates in the proteome reflects the importance of redox signaling in these compartments. An analysis of the functional distribution of the predicted candidates showed that proteins involved in signaling processes exhibited the highest prediction rate. In a set of 46 proteins, where 53 putative S-nitrosylation sites were already experimentally determined, the GPS-SNO program predicted 60 S-nitrosylation sites, but only 11 overlap with the results of the experimental approach. In general, a computer-assisted method for the prediction of targets for S-nitrosylation is a very good tool; however, further development, such as including the three dimensional structure of proteins in such analyses, would improve the identification of S-nitrosylation sites...|$|E

40|$|Gold {{standard}} sleep measurement, polysomnography (PSG), is {{not always}} practical for field-based research due to time and expense. Wristwatch-like activity monitors that estimate sleep from wrist movement are often used instead. The Actical is an activity monitor designed to estimate energy expenditure. While not specifically designed to measure sleep, it records and stores data {{in a similar fashion}} to devices that are. Dual functionality could be useful for research spanning sleep and exercise behaviours, and thus the aim was to evaluate the Actical as an alternative to PSG for field research. Methods: Ten participants spent one night in bed (22 : 00 - 07 : 30 h) in temperature-controlled (21 1 C) bedrooms. Each wore an Actical, set to record activity in 30 -s epochs, on their non-dominant wrist, and electrodes were placed in the 10 - 20 arrangement for PSG. PSG data were manually scored as sleep/wake in 30 -s epochs. Software provided sleep/wake estimates for Actical epochs at a medium- (default) and a low-activity threshold for wake. Actical sleep/wake data were compared with data from PSG on an epoch-by-epoch basis and in terms of total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Results: Actical identified 97 2 % (M SD) and 98 1 % of PSG-determined sleep epochs, at the low threshold and <b>medium</b> <b>threshold</b> for wake, respectively. Identification of PSG-determined wake was 31 13 % and 22 9 %, and overall agreements were 89 10 % and 88 11 %, respectively. TST was overestimated by 25 47 and 36 52 min, and SE by 5 8 % and 6 9 %; WASO was underestimated by 25 52 and 36 57 min, respectively. Discussion: Results suggest that overall epoch agreement between Acticals and PSG is good and identification of sleep is equally high at both thresholds; however, the lower threshold is better than the default for identifying wake. In addition, the biases of sleep parameters calculated using the Actical were smaller at the low threshold. The results indicated that the Actical is a satisfactory alternative tool for measuring sleep, particularly in field research...|$|E

These "Smart Irrigation" technologies include evapotranspiration (ET) -based controllers and soil moisture sensor (SMS) controllers. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these technologies, along with rain sensors, based on irrigation applied and turfgrass quality measurements on St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walter) Kuntze). Testing was performed on two types of SMS controllers (LawnLogic LL 1004 and Acclima Digital TDT RS 500) at three soil moisture threshold settings. Mini-Clik rain sensors (RS) comprised six treatments at two rainfall thresholds (3 mm and 6 mm) and three different irrigation frequencies (1, 2, and 7 d/wk). Two ET controllers were also tested, the Toro Intelli-Sense controller and the Rain Bird ET Manager. A time-based treatment with 2 days of irrigation per week without any type of sensor (WOS) to bypass irrigation was established as a comparison. All irrigation controller programming represented settings that might be used in residential/commercial landscapes. Even though three of the four testing periods were relatively dry, all of the technologies tested managed to reduce water application compared to the WOS treatment, with most treatments also producing acceptable turf quality. Reductions in irrigation applied were as follows: 7 - 30 % for RS-based treatments, 0 - 74 % for SMS-based treatments, and 25 - 62 % for ET-based treatments. The SMS treatments at low threshold settings resulted in high water savings, but reduced turf quality to unacceptable levels. The <b>medium</b> <b>threshold</b> setting (approximately field capacity) SMS-based treatment produced good turfgrass quality while reducing irrigation water use compared to WOS by 11 - 53 %. ET controllers with comparable settings and good turf quality had - 20 % to 59 % savings. Reducing the irrigation schedule (treatment DWRS) by 40 % and using a rain sensor produced water savings between 36 % and 53 % similar to smart controllers. Proper installation and programming of each of the technologies was essential element to balancing water conservation and acceptable turf quality. Water savings with the SMS controllers could have been increased with a reduced time-based irrigation schedule. Efficiency settings of 100 % (DWRS) and 95 % (TORO) did not reduce turf quality below acceptable limits and resulted in substantial irrigation savings, indicating that efficiency values need not be low in well designed and maintained irrigation systems. For most conditions in Florida, the DWRS schedule (60 % of schedule used for SMS treatments) can be used with either rain sensors or soil moisture sensors in bypass control mode as long as the irrigation system has good coverage and is in good repair.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a semi-emergent architecture for graphic adventures. The proposed architecture is able to create new significant story-puzzles on the fly, combining preauthored material in a coherent and emergent way. As a test-bed of this architecture we use a simple detective game inspired on the famous boardgame Cluedo. INTRODUCTION There are a lot of adventure games in the market and some of them try to tell a re-playable story that change and become slightly different for each player. Blade Runner {{is a good example of}} this kind of adventures in which characters do not act always in the same way. However this approach has the disadvantage of the same structure between each generated story. As each game takes a long time to be solved (usually several game sessions), it is not expected a player to finish completely the game more than once. The aim of our architecture is not to create a stand-alone long-play story and then make it up with slight changes. In fact, our assignment is to generate automatically short stories that happen in a closed and persistent world, in which coherence between each game session is maintained. The player must solve chained mysteries that happen in the same environment, using the conclusions reached in previous mysteries to solve new ones. The clues are obtained from the virtually recreated environment and the social behaviour that characters shows (hatreds, quarrels, debts, favours and secrets). Every element in the context is maintained coherently between stories by the plot generator of the system, that in each game establishes the crime, the scene, the culprit and his motivations. The major part of the story unfolds during the interaction between the player and the non-player characters (NPCs), based on the actions and reactions of the autonomous agents that implement the NPCs, their behaviour, goals and plans. STORY-PUZZLE GENERATION Automatic construction of story plots has always been a longed-for utopian dream in the entertainment industry, especially in commercial games that are fuelled by a large number of story plots with only a <b>medium</b> <b>threshold</b> on their quality. Of course, nowadays computers are not able to generate automatically complex stories like the ones that human writers can write. But now it is possible to take advantage of the combinatory power of computers to build some simple story-puzzles. Basically there are two approaches in the automatic plot generation: centralized and distributed. The first one is based on an intelligent system that controls the development of the plot. The second one is based on a multi-agent system in which the plot emerges from the behaviour of autonomous characters. Developing the game concept, the game designer faces the interactive dilemma: if the story plot is created with a lot of detail the characters are more constrained and the range of generated stories will be narrow, on the other hand the autonomy of the characters takes control over the plot and it is not easy to assure that the result will be valuable. The implementation of the centralized approach is quite complex lacks a truly emergent behaviour. But the consistency is also a hard problem in the distributed generation, especially if the model grows during the design process and becomes more sophisticated. THE GAME ARCHITECTURE We propose a double-layer architecture. The so-called story layer has an abstract plot generator that sets the initial game state, the location of objects and characters and the social relations between them. All these avatars inhabit in the persistent world, known as agent layer. This layer controls the simulation progress, using the guidelines imposed by the story layer. This architecture is a mixed approach to the problem of generating story plots from a set of narrative components analysed in terms of Description Logic. An AI-process is defined to generate plots from the user actions, the preauthored plot specifying and a random initial setting for the story, using an ontology to measure the semantical distance between elements taking part in the story development. Formal logics and ontologies allow the system to maintain coherence and structure in the global puzzle. The agents use the common sense-think-act cycle. Their actions take place over a module that simplifies the interaction with the objects of the virtual environment. APPLICATION Our proposed game belongs to a classical genre: detective stories and unsolved mysteries. The player plays the role of an investigator that tries to find the culprit from the cast of characters. Our approach allows the game designer to have control over both layers. Firstly, abstract generation of each story plot can be controlled establishing the theme, mood and background of the game, the set of possible crimes, scenes, suspects and their motivations. In the second place, the autonomous characters also have a set of different personalities for the designer to combine. CONCLUSIONS Our design lets the system to adapt the content of each game session to the player, depending on the player skills solving the proposed story-puzzle, the system can deduce the way the user is thinking, creating a user model that will improve next generations of mysteries.

Methods that were successfully employed to increase {{the magnitude of the}} photorefractive effect and speed up the response of these materials are also presented. Applications in the area of optical phase conjugation, distortion correction, limiting, and thresholding are also discussed. In the first part, the equations governing the photorefractive effect through band transport are introduced. The solutions giving the internal space charge field in photorefractive materials are presented for the one carrier, one species model that approximates the process in strontium barium niobate and most other materials. The coupled equations describing the two-beam coupling effect are also derived. Next, the results of experiments using as-grown potassium tantalate niobate for holographic diffraction and strontium barium niobate for two-beam coupling are presented. With KTN, the effect of Nb concentration on the phase transition, temperature dependence of diffraction efficiency and dark storage time, and the effects of the bias electric field are discussed. With SBN, the effect of dopant type, temperature dependence of the photorefractive effect, the effects of dark conductivity in Cr-doped SBN: 60, and wavelength dependence are presented. The third part describes methods and results of increasing the magnitude of the photorefractive effect in SBN. Optimization of the grating period, oxidation and reduction heat treatments, temperature control, and applied fields are discussed.

40|$|Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis 168 was {{studied in}} {{chemostat}} cultures. Sporulation occurred at high frequency under limitation of growth by glucose or the nitrogen source in minimal medium, whereas rates of sporulation were low for Mg 2 +, phosphate, citrate, or tryptophan limitation. Sporulation {{was found at}} all growth rates tested, and the incidence of spores increased with decrease in growth rate of the culture. Within the range of growth rates up to the maximum obtainable with the defined <b>medium,</b> no <b>threshold</b> effect of growth rate on sporulation was observed. By studying transient states, {{it was possible to}} determine the time taken for the appearance of a refractile spore after initiation of a cell to sporulation. Under conditions of glucose limitation, cells were found to be committed to sporulation {{as soon as they were}} initiated. In nitrogen-limited cultures, however, a partial relief of nitrogen limitation prevented the development of spores during the first hour after initiation. The results of experiments with multistep changes in dilution rate of a chemostat culture indicate that initiation to sporulation is probably restricted to a particular point in the cell division cycle...|$|R
30|$|Actigraphy {{has emerged}} as a valid {{alternative}} to polysomnography for collecting objective sleep data simultaneously with multiple elite athletes over consecutive nights [92, 97]. However, choosing the correct sleep-wake threshold is a methodological issue that may influence athletes’ sleep results. The incidence of poor sleep among athletes may even become more pronounced in case of default application of actigraphy settings [44]. Thresholds that have a high sensitivity to sleep (i.e., above 80 activity counts is scored as being awake) yield the best combination of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity among endurance-trained cyclists assessed during a 6 -week block of heavy training [97]. However, <b>medium</b> sleep-wake <b>thresholds</b> (activity counts above 40) should be used to process sleep data for elite team sport athletes [98] in pre-season training. The differences between the findings of these two studies conducted on athletes may relate to the different subject groups and conditions in which studies were conducted. As previously discussed, heavy training loads may reduce the immobility of subjects during sleep, with the possibility that cyclists moved more in their sleep due to muscle soreness induced by their training [97, 98]. Future studies using actigraphy should systematically indicate which sleep-wake threshold is used to process the data.|$|R

The propagation of relativistic flow that is continuously injected from the boundary of computational domain into a uniform ambient medium is solved.

40|$|Actigraphic {{recordings}} (ACT) {{are widely}} used in school children as a less intrusive and more extended approach to evaluation of sleep problems. However, critical assessment of the validity and reliability of ACT against overnight polysomnography (NPSG) are unavailable. Thus, we explored the degree of concordance between NPSG and ACT in school-aged children to delineate potential ACT boundaries when interpreting pediatric sleep. Non-dominant wrist ACT was simultaneously recorded with NPSG in 149 healthy school-aged children (4. 1 to 8. 8 years old, 41. 7 % boys and 80. 4 % Caucasian) recruited from the community. Analyses were limited to the Actiware (MiniMitter- 64) calculated parameters originating from 1 -min epoch sampling and <b>medium</b> sensitivity <b>threshold</b> value of 40; i. e., Sleep Period Time (SPT), Total Sleep Time (TST) and Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO). SPT was not significantly different between ACT and NPSG. However, ACT significantly underestimated TST by 32. 2 ± 33. 4 minutes, and overestimated WASO by 26. 3 ± 34. 4 minutes. The decreased precision of ACT was also evident from moderate to small concordance correlation coefficients (0. 47 for TST and 0. 09 for WASO). ACT in school-aged children provides reliable assessment of sleep quantity, but is relatively inaccurate during determination of sleep quality. Thus, caution is advocated in drawing definitive conclusions from ACT during evaluation of the sleep disturbed child...|$|R

This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a low-power end pumped Nd:YAG laser and the subsequent theoretical and experimental investigation of the antiphase dynamics exhibited by the laser. The end pumped laser was modelled by extending the classical model of Tang Statz deMars to non-uniform pump along the active <b>medium.</b> The anomalous <b>threshold</b> behaviour of the laser, where modes with lower gain can supass modes with higher gain as the pump power increases, was accounted for. The antiphase dynamics were explored by modulating the pump power and measuring the transfer functions from this input to various outputs. The laser's response to various sources of noise was also studied. Thesis (Ph. D.)
