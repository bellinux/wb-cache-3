40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} relates corruption {{with high}} levels of military spending. This paper tests empirically whether such a relationship exists. The empirical analysis is based on data from four different sources for up to 120 countries in the period 1985 – 98. The association between military spending and corruption is ascertained by using panel regression techniques. The results suggest that corruption is indeed associated with higher military spending as a share of both GDP and total government spending, as well as with arms procurement in relation to GDP and total government spending. This evidence indicates that defense spending can be considered for constructing governance indicators.

5000|$|The Australian Government {{restriction}} {{imposed on}} 2LT occurred {{as a national}} coal mining strike was entering its third month, with most coal mines in Australia located in and around Lithgow. The strike brought unprecedented attention from the Australian Government as it had come {{in the midst of}} World War II and was depriving manufacturing plants focused on the development of <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>arms,</b> including the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, of vitally needed coal supplies. Miners were being pressed by unions to stay on strike despite pleas from Prime Minister Robert Menzies that the War Effort was under threat. [...] "If we do not obtain ample supplies of coal soon our war programme must be curtailed drastically", he said at the time. This is unthinkable when our strong and calculating enemy is throwing all resources into a terrific gamble for world domination", he said.|$|R
50|$|Despite Josip Broz Tito's firm {{adherence}} to communism, {{because of the}} ideological and personal conflict with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union - and thereafter all the Warsaw Pact's pro-Soviet governments - denounced his treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia on September 27, 1949. For some time {{it seemed to be}} a serious threat and a real danger of an intervention of the country by his former allies, so Yugoslavia accepted readily the American/British offer of assistance. There were even discussions at that time on its possible inclusion into North-Western Alliance. It can be said by now that Yugoslav armed forces received during this period standard NATO <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>arms</b> - such as the F-86 and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters or M36 Jackson and M18 Hellcat tank-destroyers. After Stalin's death and the political and ideological pacification with Soviet Union, the Yugoslav People's Army later exclusively imported their equipment from the USSR when not sourcing it internally.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the mean}} time, the British were {{attempting}} to determine what official stance they should have to the war. On May 13, 1861, {{on the recommendation of}} Russell, Queen Victoria issued a declaration of neutrality that served as recognition of Southern belligerency—a status that provided Confederate ships the same privileges in foreign ports that U.S. ships received. [...] Confederate ships could obtain fuel, supplies and repairs in neutral ports but could not secure <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> or <b>arms.</b> The availability of Britain's far-flung colonial ports made it possible for Confederate ships to pursue Union shipping throughout much of the world. France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Brazil followed suit. Belligerency also gave the Confederate government the opportunity to purchase supplies, contract with British companies, and purchase a navy to search out and seize Union ships. The Queen's proclamation made clear that Britons were prohibited from joining the military of either side, equipping any ships for military use in the war, breaking any proper blockade, and from transporting military goods, documents, or personnel to either side.|$|R
2500|$|Rejection of {{requests}} for weapons and technologies, arms sanctions and massive rearmament of the Arab countries prodded Israel into {{the development of}} a broad-based indigenous arms industry. The Israel Defense Forces relies heavily on local military technology and high-tech weapons systems designed and manufactured in Israel. Israeli-developed <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> includes small <b>arms,</b> anti-tank rockets and missiles, boats and submarines, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, unmanned surface vehicles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air-defense systems, weapon stations and radar. An impetus {{for the development of the}} industry was the embargo on arms sales to Israel during the Six-Day War which prompted Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), founded as a maintenance facility in 1953, to begin developing and assembling its own aircraft, including the Kfir, the Arava [...] and the Nesher.|$|R

50|$|In January 2014, at an African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud {{requested}} {{an extension}} of the UN Security Council's weapons purchasing mandate for Somalia after its March expiration. He indicated that the Somali defence forces required better <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>arms</b> to more effectively combat militants. The following month, the UN Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group reported that systematic abuses by officials within the Somali government had allowed weapons to be diverted away from Somalia's security forces and into the hands of faction leaders and Al-Shabaab militants. The panel had observed various issues and concerns surrounding the management of weapons and ammunition stockpiles, including difficulties by monitors in accessing local weapons stockpiles and in obtaining information about the arms. The monitors also suggested that one key adviser to the president was involved in planning arms deliveries to Al-Shabaab and that shipments of weapons from Djibouti and Uganda could not be accounted for. Somali Chief of Army Dahir Adan Elmi made a pro forma denial of the allegations. He also indicated that a UN monitoring team had twice visited the government's weapons and ammunition storage facilities in Mogadishu, where it was shown the arms stockpiles for inspection and had reportedly expressed satisfaction. Elmi stated that the government had twice purchased weapons since the arms embargo on Somalia was partially lifted. Elmi also asserted that Al-Shabaab already possessed an adequate supply of weapons and mainly utilized explosive devices and sophisticated bombs.|$|R

40|$|U članku se prikazuje ustrojstvo i djelovanje mletačke vojske na primjeru vojne opsade Zadra u razdoblju od 12. kolovoza 1345. do 21. prosinca 1346. godine. Istraživanje je provedeno na temelju detaljne analize djela „Obsidio Iadrensis/ Opsada Zadra“ kao glavnoga povijesnog izvora. Cilj je istraživanja odrediti koje ključne podatke sadrži djelo „Obsidio Iadrensis“ za prikaz vojnopomorske moći Venecije u 14. stoljeću. Traženi podaci odnose se na pripremne mletačke vojnodiplomatske aktivnosti, vojne operacije (mletačko zapovjedništvo, bitke i vojna taktika) te na vojni potencijal mletačke vojske – procesom identifikacije određenoga vojnog nazivlja, vojne opreme i naoružanja opisanih u djelu nastojat će se što preciznije utvrditi vojna terminologija koja se odnosi na broj i vrstu pojedinih postrojbi u mletačkoj vojsci te mletačkoga brodovlja, opsadnih strojeva, sprava i obrambenih utvrđenja. This article {{presents}} {{the structure and}} functioning of the Venetian military using {{the example of the}} siege of Zadar from 12 August 1345 to 21 December 1346. The research was conducted {{on the basis of a}} textual analysis of the work Obsidio Iadrensis (The Siege of Zadar) as the primary source that describes the wartime events in that period. In the course of research, use was made of existing data on the siege of Zadar in 1345 - 1346 which remained recorded in individual Venetian and Hungarian narrative sources and in the decisions of the Venetian Senate from the State Archives in Venice (Archivio di Stato di Venezia). The objective of the completed research was to determine the key data contained in the work Obsidio Iadrensis for descriptions of the military and naval power of the Venice in the fourteenth century. The intent of this analysis is to ascertain the quantity of data and its credibility in relation to other sources which speak of the same event. Research has shown that the data in Obsidio Iadrensis pertaining to the Venetian preparatory military and diplomatic activities are meagre and do not provide sufficient insight into the extensive military preparations undertaken by the Venetian authorities. However, Obsidio Iadrensis is the only historical source that contains transcripts of the doge’s official letters to the denizens of Zadar, which testify to the existence of a secret plan by the Venetian authorities to send an army against Zadar. The decisions of the Venetian Senate also attest to this. The data on the Venetian command are also scant and do not provide enough insight into the overall Venetian military organization. The most important data in Obsidio Iadrensis are those which pertain to the description of military operations (battles and military tactics) and the military potential of the Venetian <b>military</b> (personnel, <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>arms).</b> The process of identification of specific <b>military</b> terminology, <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>arms</b> described in the work constituted to an attempt to determine as precisely as possible the military terminology which refers to the number and types of individual units in the Venetian army and the Venetian fleet, siege engines and devices and defensive fortifications. The data so derived demonstrate that Obsidio Iadrensis is a valuable source of data on the appearance of individual types of medieval Venetian ships and their manner of operation (purpose), the construction and position (location) of siege engines and devices and defensive fortifications. Even though the results of research into these data from Obsidio Iadrensis have yielded a limited understanding of the overall organization and functioning of the Venetian military against the people of Zadar (which is understandable, since Obsidio Iadrensis is in fact the testimony of an unidentified Zadar writer on these wartime events), it is nonetheless an exceptionally high-quality example of a medieval wartime chronicle that can significantly contribute to new scholarly knowledge on maritime warfare in medieval Europe...|$|R
