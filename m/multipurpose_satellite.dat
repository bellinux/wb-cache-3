40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} {{the precision of}} land surface temperature (LST) operationally retrieved from the Korean <b>multipurpose</b> geostationary <b>satellite,</b> Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS). The split-window (SW) -type retrieval algorithm was developed through radiative transfer model simulations under various atmospheric profiles, satellite zenith angles, surface emissivity values and surface lapse rate conditions using Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission version 4 (MODTRAN 4). The estimation capabilities of the COMS SW (CSW) LST algorithm were evaluated for various impacting factors, and the retrieval accuracy of COMS LST data was evaluated with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data. The surface emissivity values for two SW channels were generated using a vegetation cover method. The CSW algorithm estimated the LST distribution reasonably well (averaged bias = 0. 00 K, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1. 41 K, correlation coefficient = 0. 99); however, the estimation capabilities of the CSW algorithm were significantly impacted by large brightness temperature differences and surface lapse rates. The CSW algorithm reproduced spatiotemporal variations of LST comparing well to MODIS LST data, irrespective of what month or time of day {{the data were collected}} from. The one-year evaluation results with MODIS LST data showed that the annual mean bias, RMSE and correlation coefficient for the CSW algorithm were − 1. 009 K, 2. 613 K and 0. 988, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{appearance}} of high resolution satellite images, image correction using Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) has become common. Location accuracy of Korea <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Satellite</b> (KOMPSAT) standard images is still not adequate, so, in order to leverage the KOMPSAT images for applications such as mapping and change detection, it is necessary to orthorectify the images. In this study, using updated RPCs, we performed orthorectification of KOMPSAT- 2, KOMPSAT- 3, and KOMPSAT- 3 A images using various data. Through this study, we discovered that the orthorectification result using precise Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the best, but {{it was found that the}} correction results through image matching are also excellent. In particular, it was confirmed that orthoimages with a planimetric accuracy around 3 [*]m (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)) can be generated by using well-known matching algorithms with open data such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, which can be acquired by anyone. Although the accuracy was low in some mountainous terrain, it was confirmed that it could be used for generating KOMPSAT orthoimages using open data.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the work performed in producing a system-level {{design for a}} modular, <b>multipurpose</b> small <b>satellite</b> platform. A <b>multipurpose</b> platform may be applied {{to a wide range}} of missions, and, to be commercially viable, the envelope of missions for which it is suitable should be as large as possible. The research therefore addresses the particular requirements that are specific to different mission types, and produces characteristic requirement sets for each. General design requirements are also derived, such as those for enabling modularity and allowing compatibility with different launch vehicles. The commercial requirements arising from the different market and customer sectors are also examined. Industry analysis allows identification of general market trends, and predictions are made regarding the likely size and characteristics of the market in which the proposed platform would compete. It is anticipated there could be a worldwide demand for more than twenty small satellites each year, for which a flexible small spacecraft platform could potentially compete. After derivation of the necessary requirements has been performed, a system-level design of the spacecraft platform is undertaken. The resulting design is based on a multi-module, reconfigurable concept, which can be adapted to fit the different launch envelopes of Pegasus-XL, Taurus, ASAP- 5 and larger launchers, and also to accommodate a wide range of payloads. The subsystems are offered in different capability variants, which may be interchanged in response to different mission requirements. The platform equipment and structure forms a "standard parts lisf', from which the appropriate configuration can be built up. Schedule reductions are obtained due to the modular design allowing more of the integration and testing of the platform to be performed in parallel. The proposed programme for development of the platform uses up-front investment to conduct much of the detailed design of the platform in advance of any actual project. This allows the design effort to be shared across many subsequent projects, and the design phase of each new project to be minimised. The key benefits of the proposed platform and programme are adaptability, ability to rapidly reconfigure to mission requirements, suitability for future upgrading, and reduction of the project schedule...|$|R
40|$|Global {{precipitation}} measurements from space-based radars {{and microwave}} radiometers {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies during the past decade. Rainfall retrievals over land from spaceborne microwave radiometers depend mainly on scattering from frozen hydrometeors. Unfortunately, the relationship between frozen hydrometeors and rainfall varies considerably. The large field of view and related beam filling of microwave radiometer footprints introduce additional difficulties. Some of these problems will be addressed by the improved sensors that will be placed on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite. Two shuttle missions demonstrated that X-band synthetic aperture radar (X-SAR) could observe rainfall over land. Several X-band SARs that can provide such measurements will be launched in the coming decade. These include four Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observations (COSMO-SkyMed), two TerraSAR-X, and a fifth Korea <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Satellite</b> (KOMPSAT- 5) to be launched by the Italian, German, and Korean Space Agencies, respectively. Data from these satellites could augment the information available to the GPM science community. The present study presents computations of normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) that employed a simple, idealized two-layer cloud model that contained both rain and frozen hydrometeors. The modeled spatial distributions of these hydrometeors varied with height and horizontal distance. An exploratory algorithm was developed to retrieve the shape, width, and simple representations of the vertical profiles of frozen hydrometeors and rain from modeled NRCS scans. A discussion of uncertainties in the retrieval is presented...|$|E

LSRC, together with its five downscaled versions, identified, respectively, as the four-band SPOT-like SRC (SSRC), the four-band AVHRR-like SRC (AVSRC), the five-band AATSR-like SRC (AASRC), the four-band IKONOS-like SRC (ISRC), and the three-band DMClike SRC (DSRC), form the so-called integrated SRC system of systems. In this paper, first, the classification accuracy and robustness {{to changes in}} the input data set of SSRC, AVSRC, AASRC, ISRC, and DSRC are assessed, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in comparison with LSRC¿s. Next, ongoing and future SRC applications are presented and discussed. They encompass: 1) the implementation of operational two-stage stratified hierarchical Remote Sensing (RS) image understanding systems discussed in Part I of this paper; 2) the integration of near real-time satellite mapping services with Internet map servers; and 3) {{the development of a new}} approach to semantic querying of large-scale multisensor image databases. These experimental results and application examples prove that the integrated SRC system of systems is operational, namely, it is effective, near real-time, automatic, and robust {{to changes in the}} input data set. Therefore, SRC appears eligible for use in operational satellite-based measurement systems such as those envisaged by the ongoing international Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Programme and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) system projectJRC.
