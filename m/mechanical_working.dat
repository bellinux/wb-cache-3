50|$|In 1961 the Chorleywood bread {{process was}} developed, which used the intense <b>mechanical</b> <b>working</b> of dough to {{dramatically}} reduce the fermentation {{period and the}} time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows {{for the use of}} lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.|$|E
50|$|A {{major change}} was the {{development}} in 1961 of the Chorleywood Bread Process. This used the intense <b>mechanical</b> <b>working</b> of dough, {{and control of}} gases touching dough, to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf {{at the expense of}} taste and nutrition. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of inferior grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. In total contrast, traditional breadmaking is extremely time-consuming, as the dough is mixed with yeast and requires several cycles of kneading and resting in order to become ready for baking, and to produce the desired flavor and texture.|$|E
