40|$|Objective(s) :To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} acetylcholine (ACh), pilocarpine, and atropine on pain evoked responses of pain excited neurons (PEN) and pain inhibited neurons (PIN) in hippocampal CA 3 region of <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats. Materials and Methods:Female Wistar rats, weighing between 230 - 260 g were used in this study. <b>Morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats were generated by subcutaneous injection of increasing concentrations of morphine hydrochloride for six days. Trains of electrical impulses applied to the sciatic nerve were used as noxious stimulation and the evoked electrical activities of PEN or PIN in hippocampal CA 3 area were recorded using extracellular electrophysiological recording techniques in hippocampal slices. The effect of acetylcholine receptor stimulation byACh, the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine, and the muscarinic antagonist atropine on the pain evoked responses of pain related electrical activities was analyzed in hippocampal CA 3 area of <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats. Results:Intra-CA 3 microinjection of ACh (2 μg/ 1 μl) or pilocarpine (2 μg/ 1 μl) decreased the discharge frequency and prolonged the firing latency of PEN, but increased the discharge frequency and shortened the firing inhibitory duration (ID) of PIN. The intra-CA 3 administration of atropine (0. 5 μg/ 1 μl) produced opposite effect. The peak activity of cholinergic modulators was 2 to 4 min later in <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats compared to peak activity previously observed in normal rats. Conclusion: ACh dependent modulation of noxious stimulation exists in hippocampal CA 3 area of <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats. <b>Morphine</b> treatment may shift the sensitivity of pain related neurons towards a delayed response to muscarinergic neurotransmission in hippocampal CA 3 region...|$|R

Nucleus Tractus Soloitarii(NTS) is the main termination site of baroreceptor afferent neurons. The aim of this study was to determine the role of electrical stimulation of Nucleus Tractus Soloitarii on baroreflex sensitivity in morphine-addicted rats. Male Wistar rats were addicted during scheduled 10 days with morphine sulphate(i. p.) and anesthetized by Urethane(150 mg/ 100 gr body weight i. v.) then cannulated with PE 50 tubes filled with Saline/heparin (200 u/ml) in femoral artery and vein for recording mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) respectively. The electrodes were implanted in NTS, according Paxinous atlas in streotaxic instruments for applying electrical stimulation. Phenylepherine was used as a vasoconstrictor to induce acute arterial pressure. Baroreflex sensitivity was evaluated (ΔHR/ΔMAP) before and after electrical stimulation application in NTS. Control group was received saline instead of morphine. The results showed that baroreflex sensitivity decreased in <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats compared to control. There was no significant changes in mean arterial pressure and HR after electrical stimulation application in NTS in both morphine and control groups, but baroreflex sensitivity increased after application of electrical stimulation in NTS in <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> rats(P< 0. 05). It is suggested that application of electrical stimulation in NTS can modulate neurotransmission in central nervous system such as GABAergic function, therefore this modulation may prevent some abnormality in cardiovascular area in addicted rats...|$|R

40|$|Drug addiction, opiates respectively, is {{a social}} problem which {{seriousness}} is currently on the rise. One of key elements causing addiction is tolerance to increasing doses of drug causing abstinence syndrome during withdrawal and craving. Opioid receptors {{are members of a}} large group of receptors coupled with heterotrimeric G-proteins (GPCR), whose properties can be investigated using agonist- stimulated binding [35 S] GTPγS. Many extracellular signals are transferred into a cell through GPCR. Opioid receptor agonists inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase and are coupled with G-protein group Gi/Go. This work is devoted to the study of changes in isolated plasma membranes of rat forebrain containing opioid receptors of healthy subjects with membranes acquired from <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects. The rats were long-term morphine treated in increasing doses, to develop the dependency. The comparison is done firstly by binding of [3 H]ouabain to Na,K-ATPase, which proves to be a negative standard of changes, secondly by binding [35 S]GTPγS to G-proteins, thereby providing the functional activity of G-protein in stimulating the binding by the agonist of δ-opioid receptors DADLE or agonist of µ-opioid receptors DAMGO.

40|$|Objective: Some animal models apply {{morphine}} in {{the drinking}} water to generate addiction, but related reports are not free of conflicting results. Accordingly, this study aimed {{to figure out if}} chronic consumption of morphine in {{the drinking water}} can induce morphine addiction in Wistar rats. Methods: For 3 weeks, the animals received a daily morphine dose of 35 mg/kg by offering a calculated volume of sugar water (5 % sucrose) with morphine (0. 1 mg/ml) to each rat; animals receiving just sugar water served as controls. Immediately after the treatment phase, the tail immersion test was used to check for morphine tolerance, and all animals were then kept on tap water for one week (withdrawal phase). Afterwards, all rats were allowed to choose their drinking source by offering two bottles, containing sugar water without and with morphine, simultaneously for two days (preference phase). Results: While the chronic consumption of morphine led to a reduction in body weight and to morphine tolerance, the morphine-treated Wistar rats did not show any preference for the opiate-containing sugar water.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Opioid {{dependence}} {{has been}} causing limitation in usage of morphine and other opioid drugs in pain control. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the effect of short-term forced exercise on withdrawal syndrome in <b>morphine</b> <b>addicted</b> male rats. Materials & Methods: This experimental study was done in the physiology research center of Ahwas Jondishapour University of Medical Sciences. Twenty four young male Wistar rats, weighing 200 - 300 gr, were randomly divided into four groups: no addiction and no exercise, no addiction and exercise, addiction and no exercise and addiction and exercise. The exercise groups underwent treadmill forced exercise for ten days. The first five days morphine was administrated (ip) twice daily with increasing dose (5 ، 10 ، 20 ، 40, 50 mg/kg) to addicted groups. Also single dose (50 mg/kg) of morphine was administrated to them on the 10 th day of exercise. After administration of naloxone hydrochloride the withdrawal symptoms were evaluated for 5 minutes. The findings of this study were analyzed by SPSS software and One- way ANOVA (Tukey) test. Results: The findings of this study showed that the withdrawal symptoms was elevated in exercise and addicted groups in comparison with control group (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 01). However, most of withdrawal symptoms decreased in addicted and exercise group in comparison with addicted and no exercise group (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The exercise could increase endogenous opioid and withdrawal symptoms in animals but reduce withdrawal symptoms in addicted and exercise groups compared to addicted and no exercise group.
