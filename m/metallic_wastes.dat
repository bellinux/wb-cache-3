Until June 2005 approx. 6662 tons of spent fuel from German nuclear power plants was sent to the La Hague (France) and Sellafield (UK) plants for reprocessing. An equivalent amount of nuclear waste compounds has contractually to be returned to Germany, which is currently in progress. The returnable waste streams comprise mainly highly-active vitrified waste containing a major part of fission products and actinides, and intermediate-active super-compacted <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> containing reprocessed fuel element’s structural materials and some technological waste from the reprocessing process itself. Shearing and dissolution of spent fuel leaves scraps of fuel metal cladding, the end-pieces and spacers which are contaminated, activated and irradiating from their life in a reactor core.

At La Hague the <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> is super-compacted. Several, typically eight, compacted discs are stacked in a stainless steel container, named CSD-C as for “Colis Standard de Déchets Compactés”. 4104 containers of such CSD-Cs in 152 transport/storages casks have to be returned to Germany. Each one of them has to be checked and quality certified for its conformity with German national product specifications and acceptance criteria by independent national product quality control inspectors (PKS). The residue package documentation has to be complete and the characterization methods have to be comprehensive.

In the last decade, {{approximately}} 20 tons of 99 Tc have been produced by the US nuclear industry. Due to its long half-life (t 1 / 2 = 214, 000 yr), beta radiotoxicity, and high mobility as pertechnetate [TcO 4]-, Tc represents long-term concern to the biosphere. Various options have been considered to manage 99 Tc. One of them is its separation from spent fuel, conversion to the metal and incorporation into a <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> form for long-term disposal. After dissolution of spent fuel in nitric acid and extraction of U and Tc in organic media, previously developed methods {{can be used to}} separate Tc from U, convert the separate Tc stream to the metal and reuse the uranium component of the fuel. A variety of <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> forms, ranging from pure Tc metal to ternary Tc alloys combined with stainless steel (SS) and Zr are proposed. The goal of this work was to examine three major questions: What is the optimal method to separate Tc from U? After separation, what is the most efficient method to convert the Tc stream to Tc metal? Finally, what is the corrosion behavior of Tc metal, Tc-SS alloys and Tc-Zr-SS alloys in 0. 01 M NaCl? The goal is to predict the long term behavior of Tc <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> in a hypothetical storage environment. In this work, three methods have been used to separate Tc from U: anionic exchange resin, liquid-liquid extraction and precipitation. Of the three methods studied, anionic exchange resins is the most selective. After separation of Tc from U, three different methods were studied to convert the Tc stream to the metal: thermal treatment under hydrogen atmosphere, electrochemical and chemical reduction of pertechnetate in aqueous media. The thermal treatment of the Tc stream under hydrogen atmosphere is the preferred method to produce Tc metal. After Tc metal is isolated, it will be incorporated into a metal host phase. Three different waste forms were produced for corrosion studies in this work: Pure Tc metal, SS(Tc 2 wt%) Zr and SS(Tc 1. 34 wt%) alloys.

The results show that the leachates, generated in two different sections (older and newer) of the landfill, have low organic, mineral, and metallic loads, as the wastes were mainly of household origin from a rural area where sorting and composting were required. Based on pH and BOD/COD assessments, leachate monitoring in the landfill's newer section showed a rapid decrease in the pollution load over time and an early onset of methanogenic conditions. The closing of the older of the two sections contributed to a significant decline for the majority of parameters, attributable to degradation and leaching. A gradual decreasing trend was observed after waste placement had ceased in the older section, indicating that degradation continued and the waste mass had not yet fully stabilized. At the end of monitoring, leachates from the two landfill linings contained typical old leachates in the maturation period, with a pH[*]≥[*] 7 and a low BOD/COD ratio indicating a low level of waste biodegradability. Age actually contributes to a gradual removal of organic, inorganic, and <b>metallic</b> <b>wastes,</b> but it is not the only driving factor behind advanced degradation.

Most radionuclides are contained in the binder glass phase of the CWF and in the intermetallic phase of the MWF. The release of radionuclides from the CWF is controlled by the dissolution rate of the binder glass, which can be tracked using the same degradation model that is used for high-level radioactive waste (HLW) glass. Model parameters measured for the aqueous dissolution of the binder glass are used to model the release of radionuclides from a CWF under all water-contact conditions. The release of radionuclides from the MWF is element-specific, but the release of U occurs the fastest under most test conditions. The fastest released constituent was used to represent all radionuclides in model development. An empirical aqueous degradation model was developed to describe the dependence of the radionuclide release rate from a MWF on time, pH, temperature, and the Cl{sup -} concentration.

Environmental pollution caused by active mining and seepage from closed mines, continuously threatens South African water resources. Such pollution can cause a shift in water chemistry and increase the availability of certain metals to the living organisms of such a system. Even at low concentrations metals are amongst the most toxic environmental pollutants. As a result of their persistence and capacity to accumulate in the environment, metals have a lasting detrimental effect on the ecosystem. Although there is progress in the treatment of <b>metallic</b> <b>wastes,</b> the discharge thereof by industries is still a serious water pollution problem. In the past, chemical analysis of water has proven to be of great use for the detection of pollutants within the environment. The value of chemical analysis alone has become limiting, as chemical analysis supplies information on the levels of chemicals at a certain time. Furthermore, the monitoring of water quality variables often does not reflect long-term events that may play a critical role in determining the ecosystem health. It is now generally understood that measurements of only the physical and chemical attributes of water cannot be used as surrogates for assessing the health of an aquatic ecosystem. The new trend is to incorporate biological monitoring into Abstract existing monitoring strategies. Fish are entirely dependent on the aquatic environment for their survival, rendering them a good monitor of water pollution. Macroscopic changes in organs are preceded by changes at the tissue, cellular or molecular level. These changes are the net result of adverse biochemical and physiological changes within an organism. Histological analysis is a therefore very sensitive parameter and a valuable technique in determining cellular changes in target organs as a result of exposure to stressors. Fish histology can thus be used as an indicator of exposure to contaminants and assess the degree of pollution. Because of the subjective nature of morphological studies correlations with other quantitative studies are difficult. However, incorporation of quantitative methods is essential to the continued development of histopathology as a biomarker of pollution exposure, and to the interpretation of histological responses. The aim of this study is to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the toxic induced histological changes in the selected organs of Oreochromis mossambicus after acute exposure to Cd, Cr and Ni. Fish were exposed to 10 % (n= 20) and 20 % (n= 20) of the LC 50 concentration of Cd, Cr and Ni respectively under controlled conditions (23 ± 1 °C) for 96 hours in an environmental room with a control group (n= 5) for each exposure...|$|E
40|$|Powder {{technology}} {{can be used for}} solid state recycling of <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> (e. g. iron oxide as forging scales in the forge shop and grinding sludge from the machine shop). Whereas recycling of such shop floor waste by melting and landfill are well known, that by powder metallurgical process has not received significant attention in published literature. The present work attempts to fill this gap. Initially, waste material (forging scale and grinding sludge) was separately pulverised using ball mill to obtain the respective powders. For carbothermic reduction, graphite (powder of particle size < 5 mu m) was homogeneously mixed with the two oxide powders. Each of the two mixtures was compacted in a die into a number of pellets. These were sintered for in-situ reduction of the <b>metallic</b> <b>waste.</b> The effect of the source of powder (grinding sludge or oxide scale), quantity of reducing agent cum lubricant, i. e., graphite powder, compaction parameters such as compaction pressure, compact weight and sintering parameters such as sintering temperature and time on reduction and densification characteristics were analysed using Taguchi based experimental design. The results showed significant effect of graphite content and sintering temperature on the degree of reduction and densification. The source of scrap was found to be important since samples from grinding sludge showed higher reduction and densification than forging scale. The analysis of variance was used to establish the individual effects and interactions like that between source of scrap and graphite addition. This was found to contribute most towards degree of reduction and densification. It was found that degree of reduction alone does not necessarily guarantee high degree of densification.

40|$|Stainless steel-zirconium (SS-Zr) alloys {{are being}} {{considered}} as waste forms for {{the disposition of}} <b>metallic</b> <b>waste</b> generated during the electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel. The waste forms contain irradiated cladding hulls, components of the alloy fuel, noble metal fission products, and actinide elements. The baseline waste form is a stainless steel- 15 wt% zirconium (SS- 15 Zr) alloy. This article presents microstructure {{and some of the}} corrosion studies being conducted on the waste form alloys. Electrochemical corrosion, immersion corrosion, and vapor hydration tests have been performed on various alloy compositions to evaluate corrosion behavior and resistance to selective leaching of simulated fission products. The SS-Zr waste forms are successful at the immobilization and retention of fission products and show potential for acceptance as high-level nuclear waste forms...|$|R
