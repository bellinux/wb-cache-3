40|$|This review {{describes}} the different <b>microtechniques</b> {{developed for the}} extraction and purification of amyloid proteins from small specimens of fresh and formalin fixed tissues. These procedures differ with respect to solvent type, extraction conditions, and protein purification strategy. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the different <b>microtechniques</b> are discussed by taking into consideration tissue type (fresh of fixed) and size, amyloid type, and its content in the tissue. The review demonstrates the applicability of these techniques for the immunochemical and chemical characterisation of amyloid in different clinical forms of amyloidosis and in experimental small animal models. The clinical value of the applied <b>microtechniques</b> and their importance {{in the study of the}} pathogenesis of amyloid related diseases are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Microsurgery is a {{specialized}} technical discipline in Surgical Clinics; microsurgical strategies and performances {{are dedicated to}} solve clinical and surgical complex problems, working on conductive structures or on compartmentalized miniaturized organs and structures; the working conditions in which Microsurgery is applied requires more sophisticated approaches in the classical tool action-tissue reaction response loop. Microtechnologies permit to develop more promising <b>microtechniques,</b> but their application or their efficacy in the microsurgical field is not so obvious or trivial. The target-oriented surgical strategies can help to focalize the microtechnical goals, design and configuration for a valuable performance in the surgical theatre. Microtechnologies and <b>Microtechniques</b> must be introduced in Microsurgery {{in harmony with the}} new strategies of minimally invasive and micro-invasive, control system, computer-assisted, driven procedures. Microsurgeons can make easy <b>microtechniques,</b> evaluating cost-benefit in the health-care clinical platform, orienting the technological investments and the research projects of specific technical solutions...|$|R

50|$|The BSC is a {{non-profit}} organization, {{incorporated in the}} State of New York, {{for the purpose of}} ensuring a supply of high quality stains (mostly dyes) for use in biological and medical laboratories. Its origins date from 1922, when vendors of biological stains in the USA had exhausted their stocks of pre-war dyes imported from Germany. American dye manufacturers were unable to produce products that were consistently reliable in histological <b>microtechnique</b> and bacteriology (Conn 1980-1981; Penney 2000).|$|E
50|$|Wagih has invented two new techniques:The {{first was}} named Zymoblot and {{reported}} to be the fastest available <b>microtechnique</b> to detect gene expression and/or enzyme activity in any biological specimen and was published in Canadian Journal of Microbiology (1993). 39: 543-547. The second which was given the name “Mirror Image in vivo electroblotting technique” is designed to detect virus particles or any foreign protein (Gene Expression) in any tissues and {{was published in the}} Journal of Virological Methods (1994). 48: 145-153.|$|E
50|$|Trichrome stains are {{staining}} {{methods in}} which three anionic dyes are used, {{in conjunction with}} either phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), phosphotungstic acid (PTA), or a mixture of these heteropolyacids. Probably the first trichrome method was that of Frank B Mallory, an American pathologist, first published in 1900. Unfortunately, none of Mallory's publications (they go from 1891 to 1938) provide any explanation of the rationales of either his trichrome or his phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin (PTAH) method. Nobody knows why Mallory introduced heteropolyacids into <b>microtechnique.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Amyloidosis {{refers to}} a {{heterogeneous}} group of disorders associated with the deposition of chemically distinct amyloid fibril proteins. Precise determination of chemical amyloid type has diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic relevance. Although immunohistochemical techniques are used routinely to determine the amyloid type, {{the results can be}} negative or inconclusive, so that biochemical characterisation is often required. The development and application of new biochemical <b>microtechniques</b> suitable for examination of extremely small tissue samples is essential for precise identification of the deposited amyloid proteins...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} spiral loop {{was similar}} to the platinum loop used in bacteriology - Takátsy improved it by forming multiple windings in the loop, somewhat like the filament of an incandescent light bulb. The narrow gaps between the windings drew a constant volume of fluid by capillary action.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the original Galton <b>microtechnique</b> for detecting leptospiral antibodies has been developed. Simultaneous titrations were performed on 281 animal and human sera and 17 hyperimmune sera with the microscopic agglutination (MA) test and the improved <b>microtechnique.</b> Reproducibility of the improved <b>microtechnique</b> was determined independently on 65 animal sera by two laboratory sections. The results obtained by comparing positive test data from human and animal sera indicated that agreement between the original MA test and this new method exceeded 94 %, whereas the original Galton <b>microtechnique</b> and the original MA test agreed in a maximum of 77 % of the tests.

40|$|Febrile {{agglutination}} {{tests were}} done by using as antigens Brucella abortus, Salmonella group D, Proteus OX 19, and Pasteurella tularensis. Comparison of results from 23 sera {{showed that the}} <b>microtechnique,</b> rapid slide, and test tube methods gave similar titers, although those from the <b>microtechnique</b> were generally higher. The sensitivity of the <b>microtechnique</b> depended upon the concentration of antigen, and, to obtain reproducible results, the optimal concentration of antigens had {{to be determined by}} preliminary titrations against specific, positive control antisera. Readability of reactions in the <b>microtechnique</b> was enhanced by adding the dye Safranin O to diluent for antigen and by use of V-type, rather than U-type, microtiter plates. Tests were also done {{to determine the effects of}} dye and salt concentrations, pH, and temperature of incubation upon the titer of agglutinations by the <b>microtechnique.</b> Our results indicated that the <b>microtechnique</b> could be used for agglutination tests involving febrile antigens.
