Annually, these institutions spend <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>on</b> a variety <b>of</b> goods services. If these dollars were redirected to purchasing local and to minority-owned firms, the anchors' purchasing power could have enormous impacts on the local and regional economies. The thesis examines two case studies of anchor institutions, the University of Pennsylvania and University Hospitals, which engaged in community and economic development in their cities. It particularly examines the strategies developed to successfully implement procurement programs that enabled the growth of local and minority-owned firms. The thesis seeks to understand how cities like Springfield, Massachusetts, with high unemployment and poverty rates, could utilize anchor institutions to stimulate local economic development. by Iris Marlene De La O.
