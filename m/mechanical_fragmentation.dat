Patients with symptomatic acute thrombosis causing bowel ischemia require urgent treatment, which frequently includes extensive surgery. Interventional treatment may be an alternative. Purpose: To present results of interventional treatment in patients with symptomatic occlusion of the mesenteric veins. Material and Methods: Eight patients, four men and four women aged 24 - 74 years (mean 53 years) were treated due to symptomatic portomesenteric venous occlusion of thrombotic origin. Transhepatic (n= 5), trans-splenic (n= 2), and transjugular (n= 4) accesses were used.

After ensuring flow across pulmonary artery with mechanical breakdown of embolus by rotating 5 F pigtail catheter; bolus dose of urokinase (4400  IU/kg) followed by infusion for 24  h was given in the thrombus. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded and follow up pulmonary angiogram was done. Clinical and echo follow up was done for one year.

However, most of these suspensions are aqueous in nature with those exhibiting thermo-responsive characteristics being almost exclusively aqueous. The original impetus for this research dissertation {{was to develop a}} thermo-responsive microgel suspension that was completely organic in nature for use in high-performance lubricants. These suspensions would maintain or even increase in viscosity with increasing temperature. The focus of the dissertation eventually broadened to a more general approach encompassing soft, swellable particles in organic media. ^ PE microgels were developed using <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> techniques as well as from immiscible blends of PS and PE. The microgels ranged in size from 127 ± 2 µm to 0. 944 ± 0. 003 µm and the size distributions were well-described using Log-Normal and Weibull distributions. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> method produced PE microgels with long surface chains that were capable of interparticle interactions when suspended in squalane. To study the effect of these interactions, the PE microgels produced from immiscible blends were modified to have minimal terminal PE chains or PS chains grafted on the surface. ^ A variety of spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques were employed to characterize the PE microgels especially the topology of PE microgels with grafted PS chains. Steady flow and small-strain oscillatory viscoelastic experiments were performed on the PE microgel suspensions to characterize the thermal response and interparticle interactions. The PE microgel suspensions exhibited an increase in steady-shear viscosity when the PE microgels melted and the magnitude of the increase was dependent on the PE microgel concentration. Dynamic temperature sweeps of the PE microgel suspensions showed evidence of interparticle interactions as evident from the formation of a gel. ...|$|E

In many cases, patients are symptomatic. In symptomatic cases, management consists of angioplasty and stenting. Although therapy is often initially successful, factors associated with long-term outcome have been poorly defined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify factors associated with stent patency. MethodsThe medical records of all patients who underwent iliac vein percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting from January 1996 to December 2006 for symptomatic IVCS were reviewed retrospectively. There were 50 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 42 years (median, 39 years; range, 17 - 71 years). Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were determined. Patient characteristics and clinical variables were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis to determine association with vein patency. ResultsSymptoms consisted of lower extremity swelling (81 %) and lower extremity pain (67 %). Iliac vein obstruction was treated with pharmacologic thrombolysis (31 % of patients) and <b>mechanical</b> thrombus <b>fragmentation</b> (17 % of patients). The primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of angioplasty/stenting were 74. 1 %, 79. 7 %, and 85. 8 % at 1 year and 38. 1 %, 62. 8 %, and 73. 8 % at 5 years, respectively. Using a Cox proportional risk model, male sex (hazard ratio, 6. 5; P =. 001), recent trauma (hazard ratio, 5. 3; P =. 001), and age younger than 40 years (hazard ratio, 3. 8; P =. 015) were associated with decreased primary patency. In the absence of any risk factors, primary patency was 94. 4 % at 1 year and 63. 0 % at 5 years, decreasing to 28. 6 % and 0 % for two or more risk factors.

The heterogeneous nature of {{composite material}} is the main challenge for recycling. In the European Union, tighter legislation on landfill, increasing landfill tax and loss of valuable material are driving the need for development of composite recycling technology. However, the recycling environmental benefits may not be optimised {{due to lack of}} high integrity environmental datasets. This study considered <b>mechanical,</b> high voltage <b>fragmentation</b> (HVF) and chemical recycling methods. New carbon footprint models were developed for each process. Experimental modelling was used to provide detailed process data associated with the processes. The Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) of the processes were evaluated through life cycle assessment studies. This work identifies that the electricity energy demand dominates the overall resource footprint in mechanical and HVF recycling methods. For both processes, extended tool life and optimised processing rate could significantly reduce the carbon footprint per unit of weight of waste processed. Environmental impact of the chemical recycling method was highly dominated by acetone used as the solvent. The refined datasets generated in this study enable better resource analysis to minimise carbon footprint of composite recycling processes.

40|$|Sequences of basaltic pillow lavas that {{transition}} upwards with systematic gradation from pillow fragment breccias to fluidal bomb-bearing breccia to bomb-bearing lapilli tuffs are common at Askja volcano, Iceland. Based on the detailed textural investigation {{of three of}} these sequences, we argue that they record temporally continuous transition from effusive to explosive products that were erupted from and deposited at or near a single subaqueous vent. The recognition of such sequences is important as they provide evidence for controls on the onset of explosive activity in subaqueous environments. Such investigations are complicated by the interplay of magmatic gas expansion, phreatomagmatic and <b>mechanical</b> granulation <b>fragmentation</b> mechanisms in the subaqueous eruptive environment. All of the sequences studied at Askja have textural, componentry and sedimentological characteristics suggestive of a close genetic and spatial relationship between the pillow lavas {{and all of the}} overlying glassy clastic deposits. The identification of magma fragmentation signatures in pyroclasts was accomplished through detailed textural studies of pyroclasts within the full range of grain sizes of a given deposit i. e. bomb/blocks, lapilli and fine ash. These textural characteristics were compared and evaluated as discriminators of fragmentation in pyroclastic deposits. The presence of angular vitric clasts within the breccia and lapilli tuff displaying fragile glassy projections indicates little or no postdepositional textural modification. A shift in vesicle and clast textures between the pillow lavas and the large concentration of fluidal bombs in the breccia indicate that the phreatomagmatic explosions were initially triggered by magmatic vesiculation. The initial magmatic gas expansion may have been triggered by depressurization caused by the drainage of the ice-confined lake surrounding Askja. The Fuel Coolant Interactions (FCI) of the more efficient phreatomagmatic explosion was enabled by the increase in the surface area to volume ratio of the fluidal bombs in the water, producing a premix of magma and water. The onset and increasing influence of phreatomagmatic fragmentation is preserved in the presence of very fine blocky ash particles and diminished presence of larger particles such as fluidal bombs. The textural, sedimentological and environmental characteristics of these deposits suggest that phreatomagmatic explosions can be triggered by initial magmatic gas expansion, but that it is likely one of many mechanisms for triggering such explosions...|$|R
40|$|Hypervelocity (2. 57. 8 km s- 1) impact {{experiments}} into sandstone {{were carried}} out to investigate the influence of projectile velocity and mass, target pore space saturation, target-projectile density contrast, and target layer orientation on crater size and shape. Crater size increases with increasing projectile velocity and mass {{as well as with}} increasing target pore space saturation. Craters in water-saturated porous targets are generally shallower and larger in volume and in diameter than craters from equivalent impacts into dry porous sandstone. Morphometric analyses of the resultant craters, 540 cm in diameter, reveal features that are characteristic of all of our experimental craters regardless of impact conditions (I) a large central depression within a fragile, light-colored central part, and (II) an outer spallation zone with areas of incipient spallation.

Zone (I) approximates the shape of the transient crater formed by material compression, displacement, comminution, and excavation flow, whereas (II) is the result of intergranular tensile fracturing and spallation. The transient crater dimensions are reconstructed by fitting quadric parabolas to crater profiles from digital elevation models. The dimensions of this transient and of the final crater show the same trends: both increase in volume with increasing impact energy, and with increasing water saturation of the target pore space.

40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> {{behavior}} and <b>fragmentation</b> response of rock materials is investigated in this work. In particular, Bohus granite is selected with application to percussive drilling. It {{is well known}} that rock behaves totally different in compression and tension and dynamic loading conditions and high strain rates under the percussive drilling process makes the material behavior even more complicated. The KST-DFH material model is shown in this work to be appropriate in order to constitutively describe granite at dynamic fragmentation. It consists of a plasticity model in compression and a damage model in tension. The yield surface locus is a quadratic function of the mean pressure in the principal stress space and the damage model is anisotropic. Several experiments are performed in order to define the mechanical {{behavior and}} dynamic response of granite and calibrate the KST-DFH model parameters for this material. The material model is implemented as in a commercial finite element program and validated based on dynamic tests such as Edge-on Impact (EOI) and spalling test using Hopkinson bar. The numerical tool is then used to model the rock response during the percussive drilling process. In doing so, only one spherical tool button and just the first impact are considered for simplicity. The anticipated fracture mechanism in percussive drilling is captured and the penetration stiffness obtained is in agreement with practical drilling experiments. In paper A, the experimental work is described and the granite mechanical response is explained. In particular, the influence from pre-existing cracks and defects is examined in great detail. In paper B, the experimental results are used to calibrate the material model parameters. The numerical tool discussed earlier is employed to investigate the rock fracture mechanisms at percussive drilling. In paper C, the effect of pre-existing, or structural, cracks on dynamic fragmentation of granite is investigated in detail. These cracks may be the result from former impact of the drill bit, or by means of other unconventional methods such as microwave and laser that are used to increase the effectiveness of the percussive drilling process. In paper D, the dynamic tensile behavior of granite samples is investigated. Spalling tests using a Hopkinson bar are performed and a strain rate of order 102 1 /s is obtained. This experimental technique involves the same order of strain rate as present in rock materials during percussive drilling. A dynamic tensile strength of 18. 9 MPa is obtained at a strain rate of 70 1 /s.

This study reports on in vivo MR guided BH treatment, either with 100 or 200 pulses per focal spot, in three different subcutaneous mouse tumor models: a soft-tissue melanoma (B 16 OVA), a compact growing thymoma (EL 4), and a highly vascularized neuroblastoma (9464 D). Extensive treatment evaluation was performed using MR imaging followed by histopathology 2  h after treatment. T 2 weighted MRI allowed direct in vivo visualization of the BH lesions in all tumor models. The 100 -pulse treated area in the B 16 OVA tumors was larger than the predicted treatment volume (500  ±  10 %). For the more compact growing EL 4 and 9464 D tumors this was 95  ±  13 % and 55  ±  33 %, respectively. Histopathology after the 100 -pulse treatment revealed completely disintegrated lesions in the treated area with sharp borders in the compact EL 4 and 9464 D tumors, while for B 16 OVA tumors the lesion contained a mixture of discohesive (partly viable) clusters of cells, micro-vessel remainings, and tumor cell debris. The treatment of B 16 OVA with 200 pulses increased the fragmentation of tumor tissue. In all tumor types only micro-hemorrhages were detected after ablation (slightly higher after 200 -pulse treatment for the highly vascularized 9464 D tumors). Collagen staining revealed that the collagen fibers were {{to a greater or}} lesser extent still intact and partly clotted together near the lesion border in all tumor models. In conclusion, this study reveals effective <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of different tumor types using BH without major hemorrhages. However, treatment settings may need to be adjusted to the tissue characteristics for optimal tissue fragmentation...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To assess role of {{combined}} modality of <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> and intralesional thrombolysis {{in patients}} with massive pulmonary embolism presenting subacutely. METHODS: Eight of 70 patients presenting in tertiary care centre of North India with massive pulmonary embolism within 4 years had subacute presentation (symptom onset more than 2 wk). These patients were subjected to pulmonary angiography with intention to treat basis via mechanical breakdown and intra lesional thrombolysis. Mechanical breakdown of embolus was accomplished with 5 -F multipurpose catheter to re-establish flow, followed by intralesional infusion of urokinase (4400 IU/kg over 10 min followed by 4400 IU/kg per hour over 24 h). RESULTS: Eight patients, mean age 47. 77 1; 12. 20 years presented with subacute pulmonary embolism (mean duration of symptoms 2. 4 wk). At presentation, mean heart rate, shock index, miller score and mean pulmonary pressures were 101. 5 1; 15. 2 /min, 0. 995 1; 0. 156, 23. 87 1; 3. 76 and 37. 62 1; 6. 67 mmHg which reduced to 91. 5 1; 12. 2 /min (P = 0. 0325), 0. 789 1; 0. 139 (P = 0. 0019), 5. 87 1; 1. 73 (P = 0. 0000004) and 27. 75 1; 8. 66 mmHg (P = 0. 0003) post procedurally. Mean BP improved from 80. 00 1; 3. 09 mmHg to 90. 58 1; 9. 13 mmHg (P = 0. 0100) post procedurally. Minor complications {{in the form of}} local hematoma-minor hematoma in 1 (12. 5 %), and pseudoaneurysm (due to femoral artery puncture) in 1 (12. 5 %) patient were seen. At 30 d and 6 mo follow up survival rate was 100 % and all the patients were asymptomatic and in New York Heart Association class 1. CONCLUSION: Combined modality of <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> and intralesional thrombolysis appears to be a promising alternative to high risk surgical procedures {{in patients with}} subacute massive pulmonary embolism...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Texture is an important, yet complex, quality {{attribute}} of food. Food structure and properties {{can be linked}} to texture perception during the first bite. However, the perception of attributes during chew down is more difficult to explain, as food requires to be broken down to be swallowed safely. Food oral processing, which  is a recent discipline connecting food science to the physiology of the eating process, is considered to be the key for understanding dynamic food texture perception. The aim of this thesis is to understand the link between food properties and texture perception by investigating oral food breakdown, in simple model foods. Methods: Gels were used as a model for soft solid foods. Several properties of the gels were controlled by modifying the composition of gels, including fracture stress and fracture strain, oil droplets binding to the gels matrix, melting, serum release and mechanical contrast. The texture perception of the gels was measured using several sensory methods. Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA), progressive profiling and temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) were compared in the assessment of dynamic texture perception. In order to link gel properties to texture perception, the oral processing of gels was measured through analyses on the gel bolus and measurements of chewing behaviour. Gel boli were expectorated at various stages of oral processing and were analysed for gel fragments size and number, mechanical properties and saliva incorporation. These analyses were used to quantify the degree of breakdown of gels and to relate bolus properties to changes in texture perception. Chewing behaviour was measured using Electromyography (EMG) to understand the role of oral processing behaviour in bolus formation and dynamic texture perception. Results: Dynamic texture perception of gels could be measured by QDA, progressive profiling and TDS which were complementary methods. Fracture properties of gels could predict the perception of first bite texture attributes. Fracture stress and fracture strain were correlated to first bite firmness and brittleness respectively. During chew down, the link between gel properties and texture perception became less clear. Nonetheless, fracture properties and other gels properties, such as melting and serum release, related to chew down perception. Bolus properties depended on gel properties, but related better to chew down texture perception than gel properties. Mainly changes in <b>mechanical</b> properties and <b>fragmentation</b> of the bolus could explained the perception of complex texture attributes, such as creaminess and graininess respectively. Chewing behaviour depended on products properties. In addition, chewing behaviour impacted the formation of the bolus and could result in differences in dynamic texture perception between groups of individuals. Conclusions: The oral breakdown of food is a valuable input to understand the perception of complex chew down texture attributes. Such an input could be used to design foods with a desired texture sensory profile for reformulation of foods fitting in a healthier diet or foods for target consumer groups...|$|R
40|$|Taphonomy `the {{study of}} {{processes}} of preservation {{and how they}} affect information in the fossil record' (Behrensmeyer and Kidwell, 1985) is an important geological discipline. This study, by incorporating experiments on carbonate transplanted to shallow water with benthic sampling, explored {{the relationship between the}} calcimass of living and dead (sub-fossil) constituents of a deep water brachiopod-bivalve community in the Firth of Lorn (site 1. of Curry, 1982). The community, which occurs on a gently sloping sea floor at depths between 160 and 200 m, was investigated by dredging, grab sampling, coring and video transects. Biomass and calcimass of the community were determined indirectly from regressions of shell length against weight on animals collected from 10 grab samples. The large endobyssate bivalve M. modiolus, which forms large stable clumps modifies the sediment by introducing `secondary hardbottom' (sensu Surlyk, 1972) into an otherwise soft sediment. The valves of living M. modiolus serve as substrate for a diverse epifauna, the most distinctive member of which is the articulate brachiopod Terebratulina retusa. The standing calcimass (2370. 5 g/m 2 /yr) and carbonate production (excluding polychaetes, bryozoans and barnacles) of the community is very high (330 g/m 2 /yr) which in the absence of carbonate destruction would result in a rate of autochthonous carbonate accumulation in excess of 1 mm/yr. M. modiolus contributes 93. 5 % of the standing calcimass, but accounts for only 37. 8 % of estimated production (mainly due to a lifespan estimated at 40 years). Three other species, the ophiuroid Ophiothrix fragilis, the bivalve Astarte sulcata and the articulate brachiopod Terebratulina retusa together contribute an additional 58. 5 % of carbonate production. Length-frequency histograms of 0 -year class T. retusa from seasonal samples suggest that growth rate is initially slow (an increase in length from 0. 212 mm to 0. 539 mm over the first 260 days). Similar rates have been published from laboratory studies (Rickwood, 1977; Stricker and Read, 1985) but growth rate is well below that estimated from conventional length-frequency histograms (eg. Curry, 1982) or field studies (Thayer, 1977; Doherty, 1979). Autecological implications of a strongly sigmoidal growth curve were investigated by examining substrate related mortality. Larval T. retusa appear non-selective in their choice of substrate and although virtually all adult T. retusa are attached to mature M. modiolus, 35 alternative substrates were recorded. Patterns of substrate utilization suggest that from a length of approximately 2 mm to maturity there is an increase in the proportion of T. retusa attached to the surface of M. modiolus, indicating that alternative substrates (eg. hydroid thecae, ascidian tests and calcareous worm tubes) are more liable to fail as the Terebratulina mature. At lengths below 2 mm the surface of M. modiolus appears to be sub-optimal, the proportion of Terebratulina utilizing this substrate falling from approximately 80 % of settlement to 40 % at lengths of between 1. 7 & 2. 8 mm. It is postulated that grazing pressures, believed to be restricted to this substrate (Akpan, 1981) may account for this inflection at lengths of approximately 2. 3 mm grazers being unable to disloge brachiopods above this critical size. Estimates of carbonate production were compared with the composition of biogenic carbonate from > 4 mm, > 2 mm, and > 1 mm sediment fractions of grab and box core samples. Ophiothrix fragilis and Amphiura chaijei which together were estimated to contribute 31. 6 % of total carbonate production accounted for only 0. 5 % of autochthonous carbonate in these fractions. Even accounting for the concentration of ophiuroid debris in the finer fractions, the absence of ophiuroid debris is remarkable. Excluding ophiuroid debris and the two most minor autochthonous carbonate contributors, reveals an apparent trend in the remaining autochthonous carbonate towards selective preservation bias of smaller items. These trends were not seen in field experiments of relative rates of abrasion and laboratory studies of relative dissolution rates of the major carbonate components. Furthermore, estimated rates of destruction by abrasion were very low and S. E. M. examination of grains recovered from the death assemblage did not show evidence of dissolution. This size related bias may therefore provide evidence of the consequence of selective bioerosion of non-agitated grains first proposed by Boekschoten (1968). Terebratulina retusa is an outlier to this trend, being less common than estimates of production and preservation would predict, corresponding with the semi-quantitative evidence for under-representation of articulate brachiopods in death assemblages from the Algerian shelf (Caulet, 1967) and Canadian sub-littoral (Nobel et al. 1976). T. retusa shells recovered from the sediment were extremely friable. Initially this was thought to be a localized dissolution phenomenon, however S. E. M. preparations subsequently demonstrated that the observed strength loss was a consequence of a skeletal architecture which is common to the majority of articulate brachiopods. The rate of `softening' was determined experimentally and proved to be remarkably rapid (93 % strength loss 200 days after death, as measured by point loading; Collins, 1986). The friable carbonate liberates large numbers of distinctive calcite fibres into the sediment which should be recognizable as microfossils. Similar observations of structurally weakened brachiopod carbonate have subsequently been reported from the Norwegian coast, the Mediterranean, western USA and New Zealand. The reduced strength of brachiopod shells will increase the potential for <b>mechanical</b> and bio-mechanical <b>fragmentation</b> and therefore under-representation. It is probable that the magnitude of `softening' is inversely related to size and is liable to bias against smaller shells (Collins, 1986). A significant deviation from the expected 1 : 1 ratio of pedicle to brachial valves of T. retusa (bv/pv = 1. 6) was similar to the figure for Terebratulina septentrionalis from a shallow subtidal rocky coastline on the east coast of Canada (bv/pv = 1. 5 : Noble & Logan 1981). The preferential preservation of brachial valves of T. retusa compares with a strongly biased preservation of pedicle valves for Macandrevia cranium from the Scottish shelf and Gryphus vitreus from Corsica. It is suggested that biased valve ratios of these four Recent examples are the consequence of selective destruction, selective transport need not be invoked. Transport was also investigated experimentally, by laying a representative sample of shells on a moderately exposed sediment surface, at a depth of 9 m. Positions were recorded in a series of photographic mosaics and final recovery included suction sampling to a depth of approximately 30 cm. The large Modiolus valves moved the greatest distances, an unusual result thought to be due to reworking of larger items by crabs with a biologically bound and bioturbated sediment and entrapping the smaller shells and valves. It is suggested that the significance of current-mediated transport has been overstated, due to over concentration on the swash zone and flume tank and the failure to recognize the potential for biologically mediated transport and sediment binding...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Ghosts {{prepared}} in COs-saturated water from unwashed human red cells can be fragmented mechanically, but ghosts from thrice washed cells cannot. If the ghosts are prepared by freezing and thawing, {{this difference is}} not observed. The electrophoretic velocity varies also with {{the way in which}} the ghosts are prepared. The pH-mobility dependence of washed red cells flatten off to a plateau at pH 9, and the electrophorefic velocity is zero at about pH 2. Ghosts prepared by freezing and thawing have almost the same pH-mobility de= pendence, but if the ghosts are {{prepared in}} CO ~-saturated hyptonic saline, the mobility at pH 9. 4 is 0. 75 times that of washed cells. Fragments of ghosts of unwashed red cells have a smaller mobility than that of the red cells. Trypsin reduces the mobility of washed red cells and of ghosts. Sols of lipid complexes (lecithin, cephalin, and lipositol), at varying pH's, have a mobility 1. 2 times that of the washed red cell. The pH-mobility relation is otherwise similar. These complexes can be coated with dextran and trypsin. It is often thought, although there is evidence to the contrary, that properties of the red cell ghost, such as its electrophoretic mobility and its <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> are the same as those of the red cell from which it is derived. The electrophoretic velocity and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of human red cells and ghosts, however, have now been shown to depend on {{the way in which the}} ghost is prepared, i. e. on the whether the red cells are washed or unwashed, as well as on the anticoagulant into which the blood is drawn (Furchgott and Ponder, 1941; Ponder and Ponder, 1955, 1959). Dervichian (1955) has recently suggested that the ghost has some of the features of a precipitation artifact. As a result, a situation which was once thought to be simple has now become extremely complex, for if we compare the red cel...|$|E
