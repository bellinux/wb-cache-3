500|$|In early 2015, Nintendo {{launched}} its Creator Program, {{in order to}} share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos. PewDiePie joined various gamers in criticising the programme. PewDiePie called the program a [...] "slap {{in the face to}} the YouTube channels that [...] focus on Nintendo game exclusively", adding, [...] "The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo's community are the ones left in the dirt the most." [...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games that I want to play on <b>my</b> <b>channel</b> as usual. I'm lucky to be in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are not in that situation." [...] Ultimately, the focal point of criticism is toward the approval of a video which Nintendo has to administer, and may be motivated by biased intentions.|$|E

Minkovski had complained about being characterized {{as if she was}} [...] "Putin's girl in Washington" [...] or as being [...] "anti-American". After Minkovski argued that Glenn Beck was [...] "not on the side of America. And the fact that <b>my</b> <b>channel</b> is more honest with the American people is something you should be ashamed of.", Columbia Journalism Review writer Julia Ioffe asked [...] "since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president?
