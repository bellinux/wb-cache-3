Currently there is no recommendation, nor is it standard practice, to take any special precautions to keep medication storage temperatures within CRT in these vehicles. Therefore, medications are exposed to storage temperatures which may be above CRT, possibly for long periods. The aim of this study was to document medication storage temperatures over a continuous 12 -month period in the drug storage compartment of a typical primary response vehicle under operational conditions in Johannesburg.

So, {{the concept of the}} <b>Mean</b> <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Temperature</b> was adopted as an expression for the fluctuating temperature. EMRO of WHO specifies 30 °C as the maximum transportation temperature for Sudan. Five drug products of different varieties and packaging were transported with electronic temperature and humidity recording devices to six Sudanese cities of different climates. The samples were tested before and after transportation using pharmacopoeial methods. The recorded temperatures were electronically treated by Stability System II software to calculate the <b>Mean</b> <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Temperature.</b> The resulted transportation MKT to all cities, including Khartoum and those using air flight vehicles, exceeded the specified limits. The MKT of Khartoum streets and traffics reached 48. 3 °C during summer seasons. The active pharmaceutical ingredients of most drug products utilized were greatly affected and consequently the expiration date will be earlier than that specified in the labels. The average change in Artemether products was 9. 7 % for tablets and 3. 13 % for injection. Metronidazole IV fluid lost water resulting in significant increase in concentration of the solute. Amoxicillin trihydrate powder for suspension and Rifampicin tablets lost 6. 9 % and 6. 16 % from their potency respectively. It is potentially recommended that transportation and distribution of medicines should be in a controlled specifically licensed conditioned vehicle, datalogger should be attached and the temperature should not exceed the specified limit.

40|$|Background: As {{global warming}} is now widely {{accepted}} as a reality, temperature and humidity {{are likely to become}} ever more of a problem in warehouses and outlets as far as storage conditions are concerned. Hence storage conditions mapping becomes of critical importance {{in order to ensure that}} the great debate among different stakeholders on whether the prescribed labelled storage conditions for medicines can be achieved in the real market supply chain facilities Study Objectives: To assess temperature and relative humidity storage conditions in Tanzania for the Good Storage Practice of medicines according to the International Committee on Harmonization (ICH). The information obtained from this study will help to advice the regulatory Authority on the stability requirements and letting for Tanzania. Methods: The study involved selected warehouses and retail outlets. These were six public warehouses and six private medicine outlet facilities which include medical stores department warehouses, Government hospital warehouses/pharmacies and community warehouses/pharmacies. Data collection involved a site visit to mount digital temperature and humidity data loggers, which were programmed to automatically collect, and record twice per day i. e mid-day at 12 : 10 hrs and mid-night at 00 : 10 hrs conditions over a period of one year. In the current study, the storage conditions were determined through calculation of the <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> and the arithmetic mean relative humidity (RH) formula. The parameters were collected from daily point temperatures and humidity in six different geographic zones of Tanzania mainland. The data have been analyzed with the program prepared in the Microsoft Excel 2007 using the MKT formulae; and data presented in tables and graphs. The analysis for temperature and relative humidity data were calculated by using the <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> and arithmetic mean formula respectively. Results: A total of 8760 data reading each for temperature and relative humidity were collected for one year. The overall <b>Mean</b> <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Temperature</b> for Tanzania mainland calculated value was 25. 63 oC and the arithmetic mean relative humidity calculated was 60. 2 %. The highest temperature value was recorded in the Coastal zone (34. 1 oC) and lowest was in the Southern highland zone (12. 05 oC). The highest relative humidity value was in the Coastal zone (89. 0 %) and lowest was in Southern highland zone (25. 0 %). Conclusion: Tanzania which covers a large area records a variation of climate, example in Northern zone and Southern highland zone the temperature is much lower compared to the Coastal zone. The storage facilities in Tanzania do comply with the Good Storage Practice of medicines according to the International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) with respect to temperature and relative humidity. The data suggest Tanzania fits well in climatic zone IVb 30 °C ± 2 °C/ 75 % RH ± 5 % RH and Zone II (25 ± 2 oC/ 60 ± 5 %) according to ICH guidelines, in principle this argument holds only and only if the facility is fitted with air-conditioning. However, with the current requirement one puts low risk by considering the worst case scenario while on the other hand it would mean some good quality medicine are wasted as a consequence of underestimated shelf life. The economic loss resulting from this remains undetermined. Recommendation: The study recommends mapping of storage conditions from facilities not fitted with air-conditioning to see whether they will also comply with ICH condition...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} DSMC {{method for}} rarefied flows is described, by which any viscosity law mu = mu(T) may be simulated, including experimental data directly. The collision cross-section {{of a simple}} collision model is made to vary from cell to cell, based on the time-averaged cell temperature and the required viscosity at that temperature. The new method is tested in two different flows: high speed Couette flow and a plane 1 D shock. For Couette flow, the shear stress and heat transfer, calculated from the velocity distribution, agree with the theoretical values calculated from the flow gradients and the theoretical transport coefficients. For the 1 D shock, the new method is compared with the generalized hard sphere (GHS) model. The new method produces profiles of density and temperature which are generally indistinguishable from the GHS results except for a deviation in the Tx temperature component in a small region ahead of the shock. For the worst case the deviation is 4. 6 %, {{but it can be}} reduced by basing the imposed viscosity on the maximum component of kinetic temperature rather than the <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature.</b> The new method is shown to be insensitive to the number of simulator particles used in each cell.

40|$|Some analogies between {{different}} nonequilibrium heat conduction models, particularly, random walk, discrete variable model, and Boltzmann transport equation {{with the single}} relaxation time approximation, have been discussed. We show that under an assumption of a finite value of the heat carriers velocity, these models lead to the hyperbolic heat conduction equation and the modified Fourier law with the relaxation term. Corresponding effective temperature and entropy have been introduced and analyzed. It has been demonstrated that the effective temperature, defined as a geometric <b>mean</b> of the <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the heat carriers moving in opposite directions, is governed by a non-linear relation and acts as a criterion for thermalization. It is shown that when the heat flux tends to its maximum possible value, the effective temperature, heat capacity and local entropy go to zero even at a nonzero equilibrium temperature. This provides a possible generalization of the third law to nonequilibrium situations. Analogies between the effective temperature and some other definitions of temperature in nonequilibrium state, particularly, for active systems, disordered semiconductors under electric field, and adiabatic gas flow, have been shown and discussed.

We have determined kinematic distances and resolved the distance ambiguity for all BGPS sources detected in NH 3. The BGPS sources trace the locations of the Scutum and Sagittarius spiral arms, with the number of sources peaking between RGal â�¼ 4 and 5 kpc. We measure the physical properties of each source and find that depending on the distance, BGPS sources are primarily clumps, with some cores and clouds. We have examined the physical properties as a function of Galactocentric distance, and find a <b>mean</b> gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of 15. 6 K, and that the NH 3 column density and abundance decrease by nearly an order of magnitude between kpc RGal â�¼ 3 and 11.

Data are analyzed to constrain the latitudinal, longitudinal, and diurnal distribution of Io's SO 2 atmosphere {{as well as}} its characteristic temperature. equatorial SO 2 column densities clearly show longitudinal asymmetry, but with a maximum of around 1. 5 e 17 cm- 2 at central meridian longitude L = 200 - 220 and a minimum of around 3 e 16 cm- 2 at L = 285 - 300, the longitudinal pattern somewhat differs from earlier inferences from Ly α and thermal IR measurements. Within the accuracy of the measurements, no evolution of the atmospheric density from mid- 2008 to mid- 2010 can be distinguished. The decrease of the SO 2 column density towards high latitude is apparent, and the typical latitudinal extent of the atmosphere found to be (+-) 40 at half-maximum. The data show moderate diurnal variations of the equatorial atmosphere, which is evidence for a partially sublimation-supported atmospheric component. Compared to local noon, factor of 2 lower densities are observed around 40 before and 80 after noon. Best-fit gas temperatures range from 150 to 220 K, with a weighted mean value of 170 (+-) 20 K, which should represent the column-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of Io's atmosphere.

We use the column densities of H_ 2 in different rotational levels, together with those of C I, C I*, C I**, C II* and singly ionized atomic species to discuss the kinetic temperature, the density of hydrogen and the electronic density in the gas together with the ambient UV radiation field. Detailed comparisons are made between the observed properties in DLAs, the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. The <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of the gas corresponding to DLA subcomponents in which H_ 2 absorption line is detected, derived from the ortho-to-para ratio (153 +/- 78 K), is higher than that measured in the ISM (77 +/- 17 K) and the Magellanic clouds (82 +/- 21 K). Typical pressure in these components (corresponding to T = 100 - 300 K and n = 10 - 200 cm^- 3), measured using C I fine-structure excitation, are higher than what is measured along ISM sightlines. This {{is consistent with the}} corresponding higher values for N(H_ 2,J= 2) /N(H_ 2,J= 0) seen in DLAs. From the column densities of the high-J rotational levels, we derive that the typical radiation field in the H_ 2 bearing components is of the order of or slightly higher than the mean UV field in the Galactic ISM. Determination of electron density in the gas with H_ 2 and C I show the ionization rate {{is similar to that of}} a cold neutral medium (CNM) in a moderate radiation field.

We detect 34 distinct BGPS sources above 5 -sigma= 0. 37 Jy/beam with corresponding 5 -sigma detections in the ammonia (1, 1) transition. Eight of the objects show water maser emission (20 %). We find a mean millimeter source FWHM of 1. 12 pc, and a <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of 20 K for the sample of 34 BGPS sources. The observed ammonia line widths are dominated by non-thermal motions, typically {{found to be a}} few times the thermal sound speed expected for the derived kinetic temperature. We calculate the mass for each source from the millimeter flux assuming the sources are isothermal and find a mean isothermal mass within a 120 " aperture of 230 +/- 180 solar masses. We find a total mass of 8, 400 solar masses for all BGPS sources in the Gemini OB 1 molecular cloud, representing 6. 5 % of the cloud mass. By comparing the millimeter isothermal mass to the virial mass within a radius equal to the mm source size calculated from the ammonia line widths, we find a mean virial parameter (M_vir/M_iso) of 1. 0 +/- 0. 9 for the sample. We find mean values for the distributions of column densities of 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2 for H_ 2, and 3. 0 x 10 ^ 14 cm^- 2 for ammonia, giving a mean ammonia abundance of 3. 0 x 10 ^- 8 relative to H_ 2. We find volume-averaged densities on the order of 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 cm^- 3. The sizes and densities suggest that in the Gem OB 1 region the BGPS is detecting the clumps from which stellar clusters form, rather than smaller, higher density cores where single stars or small multiple systems form.

40|$|International audienceIonized carbon is {{the main}} gas-phase {{reservoir}} of carbon in the neutral diffuse interstellar medium and its 158 µm fine structure transition [C ii] {{is the most important}} cooling line of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). We combine [C ii] absorption and emission spectroscopy to gain an improved understanding of physical conditions in the different phases of the ISM [...] We present high resolution [C ii] spectra obtained with the Herschel/HIFI instrument towards bright dust continuum sources regions in the Galactic plane, probing simultaneously the diffuse gas along the line of sight and the background high-mass star forming regions. These data are complemented by single pointings in the 492 and 809 GHz fine structure lines of atomic carbon and by medium spectral resolution spectral maps of the fine structure lines of atomic oxygen at 63 and 145 µm with Herschel/PACS. We show that the presence of foreground absorption may completely cancel the emission from the background source in medium spectral resolution PACS data and that high spectral resolution spectra are needed to interpret the [C ii] and [O i] emission and the [C ii]/FIR ratio. This phenomenon may explain part of the [C ii]/FIR deficit seen in external luminous infrared galaxies where the bright emission from the nuclear regions may be partially canceled by absorption from diffuse gas in the foreground. The C + and C excitation in the diffuse gas is consistent with a median pressure of ∼ 5900 K cm − 3 for a <b>mean</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of ∼ 100 K. A few higher pressure regions are detected along the lines of sight, as emission features in both fine structure lines of atomic carbon. The knowledge of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor of the absorbing gas along the selected lines of sight. The derived median value of the filling factor is 2. 4 %, in good agreement with the properties of the Galactic Cold Neutral Medium. The mean excitation temperature is used to derive the average cooling due to C + in the Galactic plane : 9. 5 × 10 − 26 ergs − 1 H − 1. Along the observed lines of sight, the gas phase carbon abundance does not exhibit a strong gradient as a function of Galacto-centric radius and has a weighted average of C/H = 1. 5 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 4...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a GBT survey of NH 3 (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) lines towards 631 Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) sources at a range of Galactic longitudes in the inner Galaxy. We have {{detected}} the NH 3 (1, 1) line towards 72 % of our targets (456), demonstrating that the high column density features identified in the BGPS and other continuum surveys accurately predict the presence of dense gas. We have determined kinematic distances and resolved the distance ambiguity for all BGPS sources detected in NH 3. The BGPS sources trace the locations of the Scutum and Sagittarius spiral arms, with the number of sources peaking between Galactocentric radii of 4 - 5 kpc. We measure the physical properties of each source and find that depending on the distance, BGPS sources are primarily clumps, with some cores and clouds. We have examined the physical properties as a function of Galactocentric distance, and find a <b>mean</b> gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of 15. 6 K, and that the NH 3 column density and abundance decrease by nearly an order of magnitude between Galactocentric radii of 3 - 11 kpc. Comparing sources at similar distances demonstrates that the physical properties are indistinguishable, which suggests a similarity in clump structure across the Galactic disk. We have also compared the BGPS sources to criteria for efficient star formation presented independently by Heiderman et al. and Lada et al., and massive star formation presented by Kauffmann et al. 48 % of our sample should be forming stars (including massive stars) with high efficiency, and 87 % contain subregions that should be efficiently forming stars. Indeed, we find that 67 % of the sample exhibit signs of star formation activity based on an association with a mid-IR source. Comment: 30 pages, 25 figures, 9 tables.

40|$|The collision-induced {{dissociation}} rate of diatomic molecules from {{a ladder}} of rotational and anharmonic vibrational states is developed, and the correction for vibrational nonequilibrium is considered. The result {{is similar to}} an analytic correction derived by Hammerling et al. (1959) for harmonic oscillators. An empirical correction algorithm suggested by Park (1987, 1990) gives similar results when vibrational temperature is comparable to <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> but underestimates the dissociation rate when vibrational temperature is small compared with the <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature.</b> This algorithm uses an effective temperature in the experimentally determined Arrhenius expression for the rate coefficient, which is a weighted average of the vibrational and <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature,</b> whereas theory indicates that <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> should appear only in the exponential term of the Arrhenius expression. Nevertheless, an effective temperature can always be found that will numerically duplicate the proper rate coefficient at any given condition, but a constant weighting factor cannot be expected to provide this. However, the algorithm can he adjusted to give reasonable results over a range of conditions if the geometric weighting factor is taken to be a simple linear function of the ratio of vibrational to <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> in the gas...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the statistical mechanics {{of a small}} gaseous system subject to a constant external field. As is well known, in the canonical ensemble the system i) obeys a barometric formula for the density profile and ii) the <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> is independent of height, even when the system is small. We show here that in the microcanonical ensemble the <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of the particles affected by the field is not constant with height, but that rather, generally speaking, it decreases with a gradient of order 1 /N. Even more, {{if we have a}} mixture of two species, one which is influenced by the field and the other which is not, we find that the two species' <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures</b> are generally different, even at the same height. These facts are shown in detail by studying a simple mechanical model: a Lorentz Gas where particles and spinning disks interact and the particles are subjected to a constant external force. In the microcanonical ensemble, the <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> of the particles is indeed found to vary with height; the disks' <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature,</b> on the other hand, is height-independent, and thus, differs from that of the particles with which they interact.
