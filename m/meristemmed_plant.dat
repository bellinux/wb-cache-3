40|$|Plant {{cells are}} unique in {{containing}} large acidic vacuoles which occupy {{most of the}} cell volume. The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is the enzyme responsible for acidifying the central vacuole, although it is also present on Golgi and coated vesicles. Many secondary transport processes are driven by the proton-motive force generated by the V-ATPase, including reactions required for osmoregulation, homeostasis, storage, plant defense and many other functions. However, a second proton pump, the V-PPase, serves as a potential back-up system and may, in addition, pump potassium. The plant V-ATPase is structurally similar to other eukaryotic V-ATPases and its subunits appear to be encoded by small multigene families. These multigene families may play important roles in the regulation of gene expression and in the sorting of V-ATPase isoforms to different organelles.

40|$|Thalassia testudinum Banks and Solander ex König is the {{dominant}} seagrass in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean and the West Coast of Florida, yet little rhizome elongation, new short shoot production, or new rhizome meristem production data has been collected via direct measurement. A study of the rhizome growth of T. testudinum was completed in December 2004 in southern Tampa Bay that determined growth after 26. 5 months. Two PVC planting frames each containing four rhizomes with 2 short shoots, two rhizomes with 4 short shoots, and two rhizomes with 8 short shoots were planted next to existing T. testudinum beds at 5 sites (n = 10 planting frames). The rhizome apical meristem was removed from half of each set of short shoot units on each planting frame. Plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem produced more new long shoot <b>meristems</b> than those <b>planted</b> with an intact <b>meristem,</b> and larger <b>planting</b> units produced more new rhizome meristems than smaller ones, P = 0. 001 and P 3 ̆c 0. 001, respectively. The total number of rhizome <b>meristems</b> per <b>planting</b> unit (new <b>meristems</b> + initial meristem) was greater in plantings initially lacking a long shoot meristem in the 2, 4 and 8 short shoot size classes. Only the two short shoot plants benefited from an intact rhizome <b>meristem</b> at <b>planting</b> time, elongating 66. 4 cm versus 60. 4 cm for plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem at 26. 5 months. In the 4 and 8 short shoot classes, plants that lacked a rhizome <b>meristem</b> at <b>planting</b> outpaced those with a meristem, producing 192. 1 and 277. 9 for 4 and 8 short shoot plants compared to 120. 9 cm and 177. 7 cm for <b>plants</b> with a <b>meristem</b> {{during the same time}} period. The greatest growth rate increases were due to lateral branching on planting units that lacked a rhizome meristem in the two largest size classes (4 and 8 short shoots); the differences between plants with an intact rhizome meristem and those without with the size classes pooled did not prove to be statistically different, P = 0. 112. Differences among the size classes were significant, however, P 3 ̆c 0. 001. Analysis of new short shoots was analogous to the results for rhizome elongation, with the presence of an initial rhizome factor proving insignificant, P = 0. 401, and the initial number of short shoots factor proving significant, P 3 ̆c 0. 001.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to examine alterations in carbohydrate status of leaf meristems {{that are associated with}} nitrogen-induced changes in leaf elongation rates of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Dark respiration rates, concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates, and soluble proteins were measured in leaf intercalary meristems and adjacent segments of elongating leaves. The two genotypes used differed by 43 % in leaf elongation rate. Application of high nitrogen (336 kilograms per hectare) resulted in 140 % higher leaf elongation rate when compared to plants receiving low nitrogen (22 kilograms per hectare). Leaf <b>meristems</b> of <b>plants</b> receiving high and low nitrogen had dark respiration rates of 5. 4 and 2. 9 microliters O 2 consumed per milligram structural dry weight per hour, respectively. Concentrations of soluble proteins were lower while concentrations of fructan tended to be slightly higher in leaf <b>meristems</b> of low-nitrogen <b>plants</b> when compared to high-nitrogen plants. Concentrations of reducing sugars, nonreducing sugars, and takadiastase-soluble carbohydrate of leaf meristems were not affected by nitrogen treatment. Total nonstructural carbohydrates of leaf meristems averaged 44 and 39 % of dry weight for low- and high-nitrogen plants, respectively. Within the leaf meristem, approximately 74 and 34 % of the pool of total nonstructural carbohydrate could be consumed per day in high- and low-nitrogen plants, respectively, assuming no carbohydrate import to the <b>meristem</b> occurred. <b>Plants</b> were able to maintain high concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates in leaf meristems despite a 3 -fold range in leaf elongation rates, suggesting that carbohydrate synthesis and transport to leaf intercalary meristems may not limit leaf growth of these genotypes...|$|R

Chloroplasts of the NaCl-grown seedlings were impaired, with less developed thylakoid and granum membranes than control seedlings. In addition, chloroplasts of salt-grown Arabidopsis seedlings accumulated more starch grains than those in the respective control plants. Steady-state transcript levels of chloroplast-encoded genes and of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins were reduced in salt-grown seedlings. This reduction did not result from a global decrease in gene expression, since the expression of other nuclear genes was induced or not affected.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of a}} new chemical-inducible {{gene expression}} system in Arabidopsis thaliana has been examined.

Plants transformed with the beta-glucuronidase (gus) reporter gene {{under the control of the}} In 2 - 2 promoter were grown in the presence of different safeners and the induced GUS activity pattern was studied histochemically. In the absence of safeners, the In 2 - 2 promoter was not active.

In the sulfonylurea-resistant background, which derives from herbicide-resistant acetolactate synthase activity, induction of the In 2 - 2 promoter by chlorsulfuron was lower. Furthermore, branched-chain amino acids, known to inhibit acetolactate synthase activity, also induced In 2 - 2 promoter activity.

40|$|Like all organisms, plants require {{energy for}} growth. They achieve this by {{absorbing}} light and fixing {{it into a}} usable, chemical form via photosynthesis. The resulting carbohydrate (sugar) energy is then utilized as substrates for growth, or stored as reserves. It is therefore not surprising that modulation of carbohydrate metabolism can have profound effects on plant growth, particularly cell division and expansion. However, recent studies on mutants such as stimpy or ramosa 3 have also suggested that sugars can act as signalling molecules that control distinct aspects of plant development. This review will focus on these more specific roles of sugars in development, and will concentrate on two major areas: (i) cross-talk between sugar and hormonal signalling; and (ii) potential direct developmental effects of sugars. In the latter, developmental mutant phenotypes that are modulated by sugars {{as well as a}} putative role for trehalose- 6 -phosphate in inflorescence development are discussed. Because plant growth and development are plastic, and are greatly affected by environmental and nutritional conditions, the distinction between purely metabolic and specific developmental effects is somewhat blurred, but the focus will be on clear examples where sugar-related processes or molecules have been linked to known developmental mechanisms.

To provide further insight into the flowering responses of long day strawberries to nitrogen, ‘Elan’ seedlings were fertilized in mid-October, overwintered in a greenhouse, then dissected the following March and their floral architecture evaluated. Additional plants from fall N treatments were placed under ND and fertilized weekly for four weeks with 100, 400, 800 or 1200 ppm N during greenhouse-forcing under ND and growth monitored until June. Plants were dissected after forcing and their floral architecture evaluated. Fall fertilized plants were significantly more floral than non-fertilized controls before forcing. Some axillary buds of fertilized plants formed floral branch crowns {{but there were no}} floral branch crowns on non-fertilized plants. Precocity was not affected by fall N and 400, 800 or 1200 ppm spring N were equally effective in accelerating flowering (+ 1 week) compared to 100 ppm spring N. Fall N enhanced the number of inflorescences and flowers produced by the primary crown. Spring N enhanced flowering of branch crowns and the total numbers of inflorescences and flowers per plant. Inflorescence production was a qualitative response to N while flower production was quantitative. Architectural models of post-forcing dissected plants provided additional insight.

Double labelling for cyclin and histone H 4 transcripts confirms that these genes are expressed in different cells, and therefore at different phases of the cell cycle.
