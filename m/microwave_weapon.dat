This graphic violence is the game's main stylistic attraction, much like the destructible environments of Red Faction or bullet time of Max Payne. The GHOUL engine enables depiction of extreme graphic violence, in which character models are based on body parts that can each independently sustain damage (gore zones). There are 26 zones in total: a shot to the head with a powerful gun will often make the target's head explode, leaving nothing but the bloody stump of the neck remaining; a close-range shot to the stomach with a shotgun will leave an enemy's bowels in a bloody mess, and a shot to the nether regions will cause the victims to clutch their groin in agony for a few seconds before kneeling over dead. It is possible to shoot off an enemy's limbs (head, arms, legs) leaving nothing left but a bloody torso. In the last mission there is also a fictional <b>microwave</b> <b>weapon,</b> causing the enemies to fry or explode, depending on the firing mode. However, nonviolence is a possibility, if the player is a good shot it is possible to shoot an enemy's weapon out of their hand, causing them to cower on the floor to surrender.

30|$|Gamma {{rays are}} {{produced}} {{in a nuclear}} explosion, which interact with air molecules through a process called Compton effect, and electrons are scattered at high energies that ionize the atmosphere, hence, generating a powerful electrical field. A large-scale electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effect can be produced by a single nuclear explosion exploded high in the atmosphere. This effect is known as High Altitude EMP (HEMP) effect, which is harmless to people as it radiates outward, but can overload computer circuitry and damage it much more swiftly with effects similar to a lightning strike. A similar but smaller scale EMP effect can be created through explosion by nonnuclear devices having powerful batteries or reactive chemicals. This method is called high power microwave (HPM) effect. Due to generation of intense microwaves, these effects are also very damaging to electronics, but within a much smaller area. Depending upon {{the amount of energy}} that is coupled to the target, the <b>microwave</b> <b>weapon</b> systems have the ability to produce graduated effects in the target electronics [1].

40|$|Microwave and {{millimeter}} wave {{nondestructive testing}} and evaluation (NDT&E) methods have shown {{great potential for}} determining material composition in composite structures, determining material thickness or debond thickness between two layers, and determining the location and size of flaws, defects, and anomalies. The same testing methods have also shown great potential to produce relatively high-resolution images of voids inside Spray On Foam Insulation (SOFI) test panels using real focused methods employing lens antennas. An alternative to real focusing methods are synthetic focusing methods. The essence of synthetic focusing is to match the phase of the scattered signal to measured points spaced regularly on a plane. Many variations of synthetic focusing methods have already been developed for radars, ultrasonic testing applications, and <b>microwave</b> concealed <b>weapon</b> detection. Two synthetic focusing methods were investigated; namely, a) frequency-domain synthetic aperture focusing technique (FDSAFT), and b) wide-band microwave holography. These methods were applied towards materials whose defects were of low dielectric contrast like air void in SOFI. It {{is important to note}} that this investigation used relatively low frequencies from 8. 2 GHz to 26. 5 GHz that are not conducive for direct imaging of the SOFI. The ultimate goal of this work has been to demonstrate the capability of these methods before they are applied to much higher frequencies such as the millimeter wave frequency spectrum (e. g., 30 - 300 GHz) ...|$|R
40|$|Circuit {{technology}} of the 1970 - 90 era appears fairly resilient to microwave radio frequency interference, with few reported occurrences of interference. However, a proposition has been developed which substantiates fears that new technologies, with their extremely high packing densities, small device p-n junctions and very high clock rates, will be very susceptible to interference throughout the microwave band It has been postulated that the mechanism for this upset is demodulation {{and that it will}} come about by either the predicted changes in the microwave RF environment by the year 2000, or by a suitable choice of phasing and frequency at high power. The postulation is studied by developing an overall ingress equation, relating incident power density at the aircraft to the load voltage at an avionic circuit component. The equation's terms are investigated to quantif' their contribution to the likelihood of interference. The operational RF environment for aircraft is studied and predictions of the current and maximum future environments are made. A practical investigation of 2 - 18 GH. z airframe shielding is described, with comparison of the results with those from a number of other aircraft and helicopter types. A study of ingress into avionic boxes is presented and is followed by the results of an investigation of energy coupling via the cables and connectors, including the development and practical examination of a coupling model based on transmission line theory. A study is then presented of circuit technology developments, electronic component interference and damage mechanisms, and evidence of upset of electronic equipment is given. Investigations show that there is more 1 - 18 GHz upset of electronic equipment than originally thought and data suggest that thermal damage of active devices may dominate over-voltage stressing of p-n junctions. Aircraft investigations have shown that incident microwave radiation is attenuated approximately 20 dB by the airframe, in a complex fashion which does not lend itself to being modelled easily. Under some conditions this value of airframe attenuation is seen to approach zero, removing any shielding of avionics by the airframe for these cases. A predictor for airframe shielding independent of air vehicle type has been developed, based on cumulative density ftrnctions of all data from each of the aircraft types examined. The cable coupling model gives good agreement with measured data except for the dependency of load voltage on cable length and illuminating antenna position along the cable, for which an empirical equation has been developed. Computer power limitations and significant variations of most of the parameters in the overall ingress equation suggest that modelling of the complex innards of aircraft and avionics at these frequencies will remain impractical for the foreseeable future and that probabilistic models are the only achievable goal. It is concluded that all avionic circuit technologies may well be upset as postulated above or by speculative High Power <b>Microwave</b> <b>weapons,</b> but that careful use of existing aircraft and equipment design methodologies can offer adequate protection. An improved protection regime is proposed for future aircraft and a number of fUture research areas are identified to enable better understanding of the microwave hazard to aircraft. The three areas which will add most to this understanding are modelling of the precise microwave environment to be encountered, further airframe shielding measurements and analyses, from all incidence angles and on different aircraft types, and the construction and cumulative probability fUnction analyses of electronic component and equipment upset databases...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{concealed}} weapon detection are mainly used at stationary security check-points due to complexity and other serious limitations for real-time outdoor scenarios. A mobile imaging radar is {{considered as a}} proper solution for fast screening of people at mass events because {{of its ability to}} detect both metal and non-metal weapons through clothes. In this thesis, the design of an RF front-end for an UWB Microwave Imaging Radar based on MIMO 2 -D array and multichannel FMCW electronics is presented. Requirements to the design were low power emissions and minimization of data acquisition time, cost and complexity. The UWB technology provides high resolution, while MIMO technique helps reducing the number of required antennas in the 2 -D array, without a net degradation of performance. The final RF-scheme was selected based on the availability of commercial off-the-shelves RF-components. The performance of the designed RF front-end was evaluated both via theoretical analysis and simulations in a dedicated software Advanced Design System (ADS, by Agilent).

The possible medical effects {{induced by the}} use <b>microwaves</b> in non-lethal <b>weapon</b> systems are difficult to evaluate. In spite of extensive research and wide use of cell phones and wireless phones, the available scientific evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with using wireless phones. There is no proof, however, that wireless phones are absolutely safe. Wireless phones emit low levels of radiofrequency energy (RF) in the microwave range while being used. They also emit very low levels of RF when in the stand-by mode.

40|$|Capacitors {{capable of}} storing energy at high densities are being {{developed}} for use in pulse-power circuits in such diverse systems as defibrillators, particle- beam accelerators, <b>microwave</b> sources, and <b>weapons.</b> Like typical previously developed energy-storage capacitors, these capacitors are made from pairs of metal/solid-dielectric laminated sheets that are wound and pressed into compact shapes to fit into cans, which are then filled with dielectric fluids. Indeed, these capacitors can be fabricated largely by conventional fabrication techniques. The main features that distinguish these capacitors from previously developed ones are improvements in (1) the selection of laminate materials, (2) the fabrication of the laminated sheets from these materials, and (3) the selection of dielectric fluids. In simplest terms, a high-performance laminated sheet of the type used in these capacitors is made by casting a dielectric polymer onto a sheet of aluminized kraft paper. The dielectric polymer is a siloxane polymer that has been modified with polar pendant groups to increase its permittivity and dielectric strength. Potentially, this polymer is capable of withstanding an energy density of 7. 5 J/cm 3, which is four {{times that of the}} previous state-of-the-art-capacitor dielectric film material. However, the full potential of this polymer cannot be realized at present because (1) at thicknesses needed for optimum performance (. 8. 0 m), the mechanical strength of a film of this polymer is insufficient for incorporation into a wound capacitor and (2) at greater thickness, the achievable energy density decreases because of a logarithmic decrease in dielectric strength with increasing thickness. The aluminized kraft paper provides the mechanical strength needed for processing of the laminate and fabrication of the capacitor, and the aluminum film serves as an electrode layer. Because part of the thickness of the dielectric is not occupied by the modified siloxane polymer, the achievable energy density must be somewhat less than the maximum value. The laminate is produced by a continuous film-casting process, using the machinery depicted schematically in the figure. The designs of the process and machinery are dictated partly by the fact that during the processing step prior to casting the polymer, the aluminized kraft paper becomes wet with water. Because the polymer resin to be cast is hydrophobic, the paper must be dried to make it possible to coat the paper uniformly, leaving no pinholes. Accordingly, an infrared heater is placed next to the paper feed roll to dry the paper prior to casting...|$|R
