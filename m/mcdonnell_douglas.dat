5|$|At Tymshare, Engelbart {{soon found}} himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational {{concerns}} at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's {{desire to do}} further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas,</b> which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> {{was focused on the}} enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the LITENING {{targeting}} pod was fitted, {{which increased}} {{the effectiveness of}} the aircraft in the attack of ground targets with a variety of standoff weapons, using laser guidance, a high-resolution forward-looking infrared sensor (FLIR), and a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery. LITENING pods have been fitted {{to a wide variety of}} other US aircraft, such as the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F/A-18 Hornet, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> AV-8B Harrier II.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, 786 -300s {{had been}} ordered, 715 {{of which had}} been delivered, with 694 in operation. The 2015 list price is $253.7million. The closest {{competitors}} have been the Boeing 777-200/200ER, and the now out-of-production <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11 was the only tri-jet {{airliner}} in production. The MD-11 was produced as a freighter then; the last passenger version was delivered to Sabena in 1998. The last MD-11 overall was delivered to Lufthansa Cargo in 2001, as a freighter.|$|E
5|$|The airline's last <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11 J-Bird (JA8582) {{operated}} {{its final}} flight as Japan Airlines Flight 730 from Hong Kong International Airport to Narita International Airport on 12 October 2004. The aircraft was originally introduced into service on 1 April 1994. In addition, the airline operated its last two <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 flights on 31 October 2005. One aircraft, JA8543, operated as Japan Airlines Flight 736 from Hong Kong International Airport to Narita International Airport, touched down at 16:05. Another aircraft, JA8541, operated as Japan Airlines Flight 952 from Incheon International Airport to Narita International Airport, touched down at 16:37. This marked the DC-10's last flight with the airline, ending over 30 years {{of operations for}} this model.|$|E
5|$|With export {{interest}} from Brazil, Japan, and Italy {{serving as a}} source of encouragement to continue development of the Harrier II, <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> commenced work on a night-attack variant in 1985. With the addition of an infrared sensor and cockpit interface enhancements, the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated EVA Air Cargo {{operations}} {{began in}} April 1995, {{with the first}} weekly <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. EVA Air Cargo's fleet was expanded to five freighters {{by the end of}} the year. Previously, EVA Air Cargo operations mainly relied on passenger aircraft cargo space.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 was a {{scheduled}} passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport, California, to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Washington. The <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-9-31 aircraft had accumulated more than 5,500 airframe hours since entering service in 1969. The aircraft was {{operating under the}} livery and name of Air West. The airline had been recently purchased by Howard Hughes and rebranded Hughes Airwest.|$|E
5|$|Gripen first export bid was to Finland, {{where it}} competed against F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 and Mirage 2000 to replace Finnish Air Force's J 35 Draken and MiG-21 fleet. In May 1992, <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F/A-18 was {{announced}} as a winner on performance and cost grounds. The Finnish Minister of Defence, Elisabeth Rehn, stated that delays in Gripen's development schedule had hurt its chances in the competition.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation. The offer was rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the Mylar insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed the claim in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the USSR's advanced Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29. Several companies submitted design proposals; the USAF selected proposals from Northrop and Lockheed. Northrop teamed with <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> to develop the YF-23, while Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics developed the YF-22.|$|E
5|$|La Tante DC10 Restaurant, {{known locally}} as The Green Plane, is a public private {{partnership}} restaurant established in Accra. This operates from the defunct Ghana Airways <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10, which had been in operation as a passenger jet between 1983 and 2005. The restaurant serves staple Ghanaian dishes. The restaurant has been well received locally.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{locations}} {{around the}} world are named after her. In 2007, a metro station in Paris was renamed to honour both of the Curies. Polish nuclear research reactor Maria is named after her. The 7000 Curie asteroid is also named after her. A KLM <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11 (registration PH-KCC) is named in her honour.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1971, Hughes Airwest Flight 706, a <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-9-31 {{collided}} {{in mid-air}} with a United States Marine Corps F-4B Phantom above the San Gabriel Mountains, while {{en route from}} Los Angeles International Airport to Salt Lake City. All 49 on board the DC-9 {{and one of the}} crew on the F-4 were killed.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 2005, JALways Flight 58 {{operated}} by a <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 from Fukuoka to Honolulu experienced left-wing engine trouble shortly after takeoff. The aircraft immediately returned to Fukuoka Airport. Some engine parts fell on the Sharyo district of Fukuoka and several people were slightly injured and parked car windscreens damaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} airplane, a <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10-10 (registration N1819U), {{was delivered}} in 1973 {{and had been}} owned by UAL since then. Before departure on the flight from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated {{for a total of}} 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles. The airplane was powered by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CF6-6D high bypass ratio turbofan engines.|$|E
5|$|The airline has {{operated}} over 700 aircraft throughout its history. It was a loyal customer of Douglas Aircraft Company and its successor <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas,</b> operating 290 aircraft and all major models from the DC-3 through the MD-90, except the MD-11. Boeing is the second-largest manufacturer with 127 aircraft, of which 105 were 737s. Other manufacturers have been Fokker (51 aircraft), Bombardier (40), Airbus (29), Convair (22), Sud Aviation (21), Saab (14), Vickers (9), ATR (6), British Aerospace (3), British Aircraft Corporation (2), Junkers (2) and Shorts (2). SAS {{has been the}} launch customer of the Saab Scandia, the Sud Aviation Caravelle, the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-9-20 and −40 and the Boeing 737–600. SAS was the sole customer of the DC-9-20; the DC-9-40 served SAS for 34 years—longer than any other model. Fourteen aircraft {{have been involved in}} hull-loss accidents, four of which were fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{felt the}} contractors could not complete {{the program and}} instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development. <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and remain an issue of controversy, with suggestions of political expediency and scheming to be behind the action.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receipt of}} {{regulatory}} approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989. The airline was originally {{to be called}} Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline. In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas,</b> including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines Flight 191 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operated by American Airlines from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. A <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10-10 {{used for this}} flight on May 25, 1979, crashed moments after takeoff from Chicago. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. It is the deadliest aviation accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{production}} of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam War by other aircraft, primarily the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began {{to return to}} the U.S. The F-105G Wild Weasel versions soldiered on {{until the end of the}} war. They were gradually replaced by F-4G Wild Weasel IVs.|$|E
5|$|Biman retired {{its entire}} <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 fleet on 20 February 2014, by {{operating}} a special Dhaka-Birmingham farewell flight with its last DC-10, with a stopover at Kuwait; the carrier also operated nine separate aviation enthusiasts' scenic flights at Birmingham, from 22–24 February, three flights a day. The aircraft was then {{offered for sale}} as scrap in Dhaka. The Airbus A310-300s were withdrawn from service in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering {{to the needs of}} the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E
5|$|Following {{experience}} {{with both the}} Tornado and the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F-15E Strike Eagle, the RSAF discontinued low-level mission training in the F-15E {{in light of the}} Tornado's superior low-altitude flight performance. In addition, 10 of the Saudi Tornados were outfitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions. The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon; the retired aircraft were being purchased back by the UK as of 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|La Tante DC10 Restaurant is a {{restaurant}} located inside a converted <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 formerly {{used by the}} defunct Ghana Airways. Formerly flying 380 passengers, it has {{been converted into a}} 118-seat restaurant with large numbers of the seats removed in order to provide adequate space for patrons and for the installation of dining tables. An annex was attached to {{the right side of the}} fuselage to accommodate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The A320 {{family was}} {{developed}} {{to compete with the}} 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier to the A318/A319.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> A-4G Skyhawk is {{a variant}} of the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack {{aircraft}} developed for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The model was based on the A-4F variant of the Skyhawk, and was fitted with slightly different avionics as well as the capacity to operate AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The RAN received ten A-4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971, and operated the type from 1967 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|The <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} their air wings.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operated}} 24 <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> F-4E PhantomII fighter-bomber {{aircraft in}} the ground attack role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays {{in the delivery of}} the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, but the government did not agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft, a 7-year old <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> MD-11, {{serial number}} 48448, {{registration}} HB-IWF, was manufactured in 1991 and Swissair was its only operator. It bore {{the title of}} Vaud, in honour of the Swiss canton of the same name. The cabin was configured with 241seats. First and business class seats were equipped with an in-seat in-flight entertainment system. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney 4462 turbofan engines and had logged about 36,000 hours before the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{signing of}} a Civil Air Transport Agreement between China and Japan on 20 April 1974, caused the {{suspension}} of air routes between the Taiwan and Japan on 21 April. A new subsidiary, Japan Asia Airways, was established on 8 August 1975, and air services {{between the two countries}} were restored on 15 September. During the 1970s the airline bought the Boeing 727, Boeing 747 and <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 for its growing routes within Japan and to other countries.|$|E
5|$|A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 {{were the}} first {{aircraft}} in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.|$|E
5|$|In June 1987, as {{a private}} venture, BAe, <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas,</b> and Smiths Industries signed an MoU for the {{development}} of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers. The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as an agent for the three participating countries, awarded <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> the contract to develop the improved Harrier. The award was followed by an order from the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft. Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft. Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at CASA's facility in Seville, Spain, and Alenia Aeronautica's facility in Turin, Italy. The UK also participated in the program by manufacturing components for the AV-8B.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the <b>McDonnell</b> <b>Douglas</b> DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|E
