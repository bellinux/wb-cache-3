2500|$|Using {{nanobiotechnology}} {{to study}} the ECM allows scientists to investigate the binding interactions that occur between the ECM and its supporting environment. [...] Investigators were able {{to study the}}se interactions by utilizing tools such as optical tweezers, which {{have the ability to}} trap nano-scale objects with focused light. [...] The tweezers can affect the binding of a substrate to the ECM by attempting to draw the substrate away from it. [...] The light emitted from the tweezers was used to restrain ECM-coated <b>microbeads,</b> and the changes in the force exerted by the ECM onto the substrate were studied by modulating the effect of the optical tweezers. [...] Experiments showed that the force exerted by the ECM on the substrate positively correlated with the force of the tweezers, which led to the subsequent discovery that the ECM and the transmembrane proteins are able to sense external forces, and can adapt to overcome these forces.|$|E

40|$|Background. Accommodation to {{antibody}} is {{an important}} mechanism in successful ABO-incompatible transplantation, but its importance in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody-incompatible transplantation is less clear, as sensitive techniques facilitating daily measurement of donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSAs) have only recently been developed. Methods. We report 24 patients who had HLA antibody-incompatible kidney transplantation (21 living donors, 3 deceased), 21 of whom had pretransplant plasmapheresis. Eight had positive complement-dependent cytotoxic (CDC) crossmatch (XM) pretransplant plasmapheresis, nine had positive flow cytometric (FC) XM, and seven had DSA detectable by <b>microbead</b> analysis only. After transplant, DSA levels were monitored closely with <b>microbead</b> assays. Results. Rejection occurred in five of eight (62. 5 %) CDC-positive cases, in three of nine (33 %) FC-positive cases, and in two of seven (29 %) of microbead-only cases at a median of 6. 5 days after transplantation. Resolution occurred at a median of 15 days after transplantation, in 8 of 10 cases when the <b>microbead</b> level of DSA had median fluorescence intensity (MFI) > 2000 U, in 6 of 10 when the <b>microbead</b> MFI > 4000 U. In 8 of 10 cases, the <b>microbead</b> MFI {{at the time of}} resolution was greater than at the onset. DSA did not always cause clinical rejection. In five cases with a posttransplant DSA peaking at MFI > 2000 U on <b>microbead</b> assay, rejection did not occur. Conclusion. These data suggest that the dominant method of successful transplantation was function of the transplant in the presence of circulating DSA, and they also define the period during which this occurred...|$|R

40|$|G-CSF in {{individual}} follicular fluids correlates {{with the potential}} of the corresponding embryo to result in a live birth after transfer in IVF. To evaluate the requirements for routine follicular fluid G-CSF quantification, we compared follicular fluid G-CSF measurements made with two multiplexed <b>microbead</b> assays purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories and R&D Systems, and a commercial G-CSF ELISA (R&D Systems). Individual follicular fluids (n= 139) associated with transferred embryos were analysed to determine cytokine profile and the fate of each transferred embryo was recorded. The effect of multiplexing as well as comparison of the respective performances of the <b>microbead</b> assay with a flow cytometry assay was explored. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the performance and sensitivity/specificity of each method for individual follicular fluids. Covariate factors known to influence IVF outcome such as age, serum oestradiol and embryo score were systematically integrated in each analysis. The quantification of follicular fluid G-CSF using <b>microbead</b> assay methodologies, but not ELISA, yielded results showing the utility of follicular fluid G-CSF as a biomarker predictive of a successful delivery (Au(roc) : 0. 77 [0. 68 - 0. 84] (p= 0. 003) and 0. 75 [0. 66 - 0. 82] (p= 0. 004) for Bio-Rad and R&D Systems <b>microbead</b> assays respectively), whereas follicular fluid G-CSF values quantified by ELISA were not predictive (Au(roc) : 0. 61 [0. 52 - 0. 70] p= 0. 84). <b>Microbead</b> assay and flow cytometry appeared similarly efficient for quantifying follicular fluid G-CSF and multiplex versus single-plex assays did not influence the reliability of quantification.

IVC technology uses the aqueous droplets in water–oil emulsions to compartmentalize individual genes and gene products. STABLE display and <b>microbead</b> display technologies utilize noncovalent biotin–streptavidin binding to link biotin-labeled DNA templates and streptavidin-fused proteins.|$|R
40|$|Background—Passive {{infusion}} of HLA antibodies has {{been implicated in}} transfusion reactions. A rapid, inexpensive method of screening blood donors for HLA antibodies might {{reduce the incidence of}} reactions. A high-throughput microbead-flow analyzer HLA antibody detection technique was compared with an ELISA method. Materials and Method— 96 apheresis platelet donors were tested for antibodies to Class I and II HLA antigens using mixed antigen microbead-flow analyzer and ELISA assays. For both assays, samples reactive in the mixed antigen assay were tested with a panel reactive antibody (PRA) assay. Samples reactive in both the mixed antigen and PRA assays were considered positive. Results—In the mixed antigen <b>microbead</b> assay 46 (48 %) samples were reactive to Class I antigens and 20 (21 %) to Class II. Further testing in the <b>microbead</b> PRA assay revealed that 34 (35 %) had antibodies to Class I antigens, 18 (19 %) to Class II, and 42 (44 %) to either Class I or II. Class I antibodies were present in 56 % of females and 36 % of males. In the mixed antigen ELISA assay 4 samples were reactive with Class I antigens; 4 with Class II antigens, and 5 with Class I or Class II. All 5 reactive samples were also reactive in the ELISA PRA assay and were from females. Conclusion—The <b>microbead</b> assay was more sensitive than the ELISA assay and detected antibodies in a large proportion of donors. Samples reactive in the mixed antigen <b>microbead</b> assay should be confirmed by a second assay before concluding that antibodies are present...|$|R

50|$|<b>Microbeads</b> are purposefully {{manufactured}} for cosmetics, cleaning products, {{and personal}} care products in many countries around the world.

40|$|To {{maintain}} healthy nonhuman primates {{for use in}} biomedical research, {{animals are}} routinely screened for several infectious agents at most facilities. Commonly, monkey serum samples are tested by conventional immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or Western blotting, for antibodies to specific infectious agents. For testing for antibodies against multiple agents in each sample, conventional immunoassays are laborious and time-consuming. More efficient immunoassays are needed. Accordingly, we have developed a novel multiplex serodiagnostic system based on individually identifiable, fluorescent <b>microbead</b> sets, where each bead set is coated with antigens from a purified preparation of a specific virus. The coated bead sets are mixed to enable the detection of antibodies to multiple viruses in one serum or plasma sample. These viruses include four agents that are routinely tested for maintenance of specific-pathogen-free monkeys, namely, simian immunodeficiency virus, simian type D retrovirus, simian T-cell lymphotropic virus, and herpes B virus, as well as simian foamy virus and rhesus cytomegalovirus, {{both of which are}} commonly found in nonhuman primates. This multiplex <b>microbead</b> immunoassay (MMIA) enabled the simultaneous detection of antibodies to all six viruses in single serum samples as small as 1 microliter.
