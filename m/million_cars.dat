5|$|The decade {{began with}} 25 million {{registered}} automobiles on the road, {{most of which}} predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to rationing and restrictions. By 1950, most factories had made {{the transition to a}} consumer-based economy, and more than 8 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> registered in the United States, more than twice the number {{at the start of the}} decade.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} difficulties {{faced by the}} first Wilson government, it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office. Unemployment was kept below 2.7%, and inflation {{for much of the}} 1960s remained below 4%. Living standards generally improved, while public spending on housing, social security, transport, research, education and health went up by an average of more than 6% between 1964 and 1970. The average household grew steadily richer, with the number of cars in the United Kingdom rising from one to every 6.4 persons to one for every five persons in 1968, representing a net increase of three <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> on the road. The rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969, as demonstrated by television sets (from 88% to 90%), refrigerators (from 39% to 59%), and washing machines (from 54% to 64%).|$|E

500|$|According to Roberts, [...] "What Howe {{started in}} 1940 was an Industrial Revolution, so {{widespread}} that most Canadians {{were unaware of}} its extent or of its penetration into the country's economy." [...] Although there had been increases in production throughout {{the first three years}} of the war, the minister's efforts truly bore fruit in 1943, in which Canada had the fourth-highest industrial production among the Allies, trailing only the US, USSR, and Britain. By 1944, Canada had produced over 600ships for the war effort, 1,100aircraft, and over half a <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> and trucks, of which 31,000 were armoured. According to Roberts, Howe's actions swung Canada's economy from agriculture-based to industrial, a change which would prove permanent.

500|$|In 1973, Ford's Environmental and Safety Engineering {{division}} {{developed a}} cost-benefit analysis entitled Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires for submission to the NHTSA {{in support of}} Ford's objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation. The document {{became known as the}} [...] "Pinto Memo". [...] Cost-benefit analysis was one tool used in the evaluation of safety design decisions accepted by the industry and the NHTSA. The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle rollovers for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers. [...] The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972. [...] In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. [...] The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a cost to society of $49.5 million.|$|E
500|$|Since 1975, {{and as a}} {{response}} to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (...) , a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane. It began with a low blend of anhydrous alcohol with regular gasoline in 1976, and since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of alcohol or gasohol E25. In 1979, and as {{a response}} to the second oil crisis, the first vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol (E100) was launched to the market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by Fiat, Volkswagen, GM and Ford. The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices. After reaching more than 4 <b>million</b> <b>cars</b> and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s, the use of E100-only vehicles sharply declined after increases in sugar prices produced shortages of ethanol fuel.|$|E
