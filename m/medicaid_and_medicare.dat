40|$|Review {{features}} four {{articles on}} payment and service delivery for care {{of individuals with}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syn-drome (AIDS). These articles focus on the following topics: the cost and financing of care for persons with HIV disease, Medicare utilization of beneficiaries with AIDS, HIV/AIDS drug assistance pro-grams funded under Title II of the Ryan White Care Act, and health-based payment systems for HIV/AIDS. This issue contains four papers relating to payment and service delivery for care of individuals with HIV or AIDS. The extent of the HIV/AIDS problem is well known, and the financing and service delivery problems have become more pronounced over time. New therapies and methods of organizing care can have significant effects. For instance, the rapid increase in use of new combination drug therapies has had a dramatic effect on the survival of per-sons with HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). The financing burden for HIV/AIDS care is large. <b>Medicaid</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Medicare</b> 2 account for the largest proportion of Federal spending for care and assistance for persons with HIV/AIDS (Henry J...|$|R
