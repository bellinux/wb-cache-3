5|$|Seeing {{the damage}} they've done, the babies quickly rush back downstairs as the projectionist notices the {{incredible}} <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> tries {{to save the}} film unsuccessfully. Grandpa Lou finds them after getting some snacks from the concession stand (he comments on the mess the babies caused, telling Larry and Steve how in his time {{they knew how to}} keep a work place clean). Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E
5|$|The jury retired {{at noon on}} Saturday 28 February, and {{returned}} to the court within 30 minutes. Their verdict declared that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy's conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to address the court, the Claimant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years' imprisonment. Kenealy's behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> from Gray's Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy's patent as a Queen's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|The six {{warehouse}} workers win $950,000in {{a lottery}} pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of {{running through the}} office, making a <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, and falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not winning is {{to ask for the}} phone number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole of}} the Pendennis site {{was placed in the}} {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and many of the more modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, and placed a greater priority on the conservation of its more modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> scream.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{broke out}} in 1914, when {{military}} opinions on the utility of Calshot Castle had shifted considerably. The decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at the two entrances to the Solent, rather than at Calshot and Southampton Water. At the start of conflict the boom was removed and replaced by anti-submarine nets further up the coast' two of Calshot's guns were removed the following year to protect the new nets. The airbase was used for training purposes until 1916, when it took on anti-submarine patrols over the Channel, where the German raids had started to inflict critical damage. Almost 3,500 hours were flown by aircraft from Calshot that year, with over 3,500 being flown in 1917 and over 9,000 in just three months of 1918. Subordinate air stations were created in Bembridge, Newhaven, Polegate and Portland. A cabin was built {{on top of the}} keep to oversee air operations, the Castle Yacht Club was taken over for use as the officers' <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> the air station spread out across Calshot Spit, including occupying the 1895 battery. Calshot's remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to the front line in France.|$|E

25|$|Initially, H Battery was {{accommodated}} {{in tents}} near a small freshwater stream emptying into Sunny Bay, about 500 yards {{south of the}} gun emplacements, while camp buildings were erected there by the local Civil Construction Corps. Constructed mostly of timber from Johnson's sawmill at Stratford, {{on the outskirts of}} Cairns, these buildings were of a standard rectangular design measuring 60 feet by 20 feet. They included: 7 barrack rooms, officers' quarters, sergeants' quarters (each of these having separate ablution blocks and latrines), battery office, quarter master's store, officers' <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> kitchen, gunners' <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> kitchen, canteen and recreation room, and a small battery charging room to supply the camp with electricity. About 150 yards north of the camp a workshop was erected, and north of this, about half-way between the camp and the defence installations, a hospital and RAP shelter were built. There was no road from Cairns to the camp, which had to be supplied via boat (the unit had its own two-masted vessel, the Eulalie). A timber jetty was constructed at Sunny Bay near the camp site, and closer to the Cape a stone and concrete ramp for a landing barge.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} the site of three prisoner-of-war (POW) camps from February 1944 through April 1946. At their peak, the camps held 550 German prisoners. The first camp was located on the corner of Shipyard Boulevard and Carolina Beach Road; it was moved {{downtown}} to Ann Street, between 8th and 10th avenues, when it outgrew the original location. A smaller contingent of prisoners was assigned to a third site, working in the officers' <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> doing grounds keeping at Bluethenthal Army Air Base, which is now Wilmington International Airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} multiplied as directors' {{personal involvement}} and commitments were disclosed, but the creditors {{were interested in}} retrieving something from the <b>mess,</b> <b>and</b> after considerable negotiation an agreement was reached, ratified as the Neath & Brecon Amalgamation and Arrangement Act of 26 July 1869. This authorised the conversion of debts into 6% debentures and extinguished nearly all other claims against the company. The 1867 Act granting additional capital was repealed, and the authorised capital was now ¬£1,280,000. The line {{was said to have}} really cost ¬£300,000 in cash.|$|E

Kemp received praise from the Sergeant's <b>Mess</b> <b>and</b> from Prince Harry, who briefly served in Afghanistan as a forward air controller. It also gave some of the soldiers on the ground the chance to see how close some of the situations they were in actually are, something they don't appreciate at the time in the heat of battle.|$|E
25|$|Although the Italians {{were expecting}} an attack, {{they did not}} believe that it would be {{possible}} to do so from vehicles coming from the main road. Instead, they had been preparing to counter foot-soldiers attacking from the south. As a consequence T1 patrol were able to mount their attack with little opposition. The next target was the concrete administration building which also housed the <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> barracks. Grenades were thrown through the windows, which started a blaze inside. A hangar and other buildings, as well as some motorised transport, were shot-up and a petrol dump of 44-gallon drums was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest of}} 13 {{children}} of a Sri Lankan couple, K. S.

His father was a clerk, and as the family was not well off he often could not afford books and had to borrow them and copy out texts by hand. He was a pupil of the Bukit Mertajam High School. Still a student during the Japanese Occupation, to contribute towards his family's finances he worked as a mess boy at a Japanese officers' <b>mess</b> <b>and</b> later as a translator for the Japanese authorities.|$|E
40|$|Dining {{facilities}} aboard naval vessels, generally {{referred to}} as messing facilities, are grouped into the two distinct categories of general <b>messes</b> <b>and</b> private <b>messes.</b> This thesis is directed towards automating the transaction processing {{in the area of}} private <b>messes</b> <b>and</b> generally providing improved decision support to the <b>mess</b> treasurer. Officers <b>and</b> chief petty officers are authorized to establish private <b>messes</b> <b>and</b> today every naval vessel maintains at least one and sometimes several private messes. Membership is restricted by regulation and the costs of operation are borne by the membership on a prorated basis. The methods for such prorating can vary from one <b>mess</b> to another <b>and</b> the assets held by each mess can range in value from several hundred to several thousands dollars. Financial management of the mess is performed by an elected mess treasurer. This thesis examines the design and development of an automated information system to support the records keeping and reporting functions for private messes afloat. A system life cycle method was used to develop the program, Private Mess Accounting System (PMAS). This computer program was then demonstrated for potential users and statistical information was gathered and analyzed on the program's potential impact.

50|$|The band members, some of {{whom had}} stayed in the music business, reunited twice in the 1990s to play {{benefits}} for CBGB, which periodically suffered tax issues. Efforts were made to reform the band, which included early auditions with Golden, who had established a career in film and on stage, and two other female singers, Caren <b>Messing</b> <b>and</b> Kathy McCloskey, who had worked with Racioppo in another band. Golden ultimately decided not to join the reformed band, <b>and</b> <b>Messing</b> <b>and</b> McCloskey together took the female lead. The reformed band first played for the public at CBGB in May 2003, and continue to perform periodically.|$|R
