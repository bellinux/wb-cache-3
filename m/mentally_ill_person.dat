5|$|His next film, Vanakkatukuriya Kathaliye, has an {{introductory}} song to mark his entry, {{a trend that}} would soon catch on in with his later films. Mullum Malarum, released during the same period, received critical acclaim. The film marked the directional debut of J. Mahendran, with a screenplay adapted from a novel {{of the same name}} published in Kalki. It eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and a special prize for Rajinikanth as Best Actor at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. Following this, he made a foray into Malayalam cinema through the fantasy film Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum, based on a story from the Arabian Nights. The same year, he acted in Dharma Yuddam, in which he played a <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person</b> taking revenge for his parents' deaths. He then co-starred with N. T. Rama Rao in Tiger. With the completion of Tiger, Rajinikanth had acted in 50 films over a period of four years, and in four languages. Some other popular films released during this period are the youthful entertainer Ninaithale Inikkum, the Tamil–Kannada bilingual Priya, the Telugu film Amma Evarikkaina Amma and the melodrama Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai. Priya, based on a detective novel by Sujatha Rangarajan, had the distinction of being the first film of Rajinikanth to be shot mostly outside India, mainly in Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The paper {{focused on}} the right to health of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> in Ghana with the {{research}} area being the New Jerusalem Chapel in Ghana. The research aimed at finding out how the right to health of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> was being fulfilled in the New Jerusalem chapel in particular and Ghana as a whole by focusing on health care and the determinants of health. The study also concerned itself with the particular agency that has the obligation to respect, protect and promote the health rights of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> in Ghana. The research question that the study aimed to answer is whether religious beliefs and economic factors influence <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> right to health in Ghana. Empirical data was collected through interviews and observations with the help of simple convenience and purposive sampling techniques used to select respondents from CHRAJ, <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons,</b> and caretakers of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons.</b> By analyzing data collected from the survey with human rights principles and theories, it was found out that; religious beliefs and economic constraints are likely to cause a violation of the right to health of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> in Ghana...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, Ajith {{appeared}} in three commercially successful Tamil films. Dheena, A. R. Murugadoss's debut film co-starring Laila Mehdin and Suresh Gopi, indirectly {{marked the beginning}} of a new image of Ajith, that of an action hero that would appeal to the masses. Furthermore, Ajith's nickname in the film, Thala, Tamil for Leader, became a new identity for the actor amongst his fans. In the same year, he was offered a role in Nandha, which he rejected. His next was the much-hyped thriller Citizen, portraying him in ten different get-ups and it became a commercial success at the box office. A role in the family drama Poovellam Un Vasam followed opposite Jyothika and was a success commercially and critically, earning a Special Best Actor Award from the Tamil Nadu State. The year ended off with an appearance in Santosh Sivan's Hindi project Asoka, in which Ajith {{appeared in}} a brief negative role alongside Shah Rukh Khan, which did not perform well. In 2002, Ajith appeared in three films, the first two, Red and Raja being box office disappointments, the former further building up his image as an action hero. The third film Villain, in which Ajith appeared in dual roles, one as a <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person,</b> became successful and earned his second Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award.|$|E
500|$|During the investigation, {{the matter}} of Cho's court-ordered mental health {{treatment}} was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that he never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient. The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order. In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that {{the court did not}} notify his office that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, [...] "When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency... The one responsible for ensuring that the <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person</b> receives help in these sort of cases... is the mentally ill person." ...|$|E
500|$|Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona {{proposed}} an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill {{and stated that}} [...] "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person</b> {{who is not a}} resident of Alaska." [...] In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial element—the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska. The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial [...] "detailed provisions for commitment, hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" [...] included in title I of the original House bill. [...] This amended proposal left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill:However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of the country other than Alaska. Partly {{as a result of this}} misunderstanding, but more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAcross the United States, mass murder events {{have been on}} the rise for nearly a decade. This thesis found that persons with serious mental illness perpetrated a statistically significant number of these events. Currently, law enforcement agencies are often the first—and in many communities the only resource—available to assist and assess <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> in crisis. This thesis investigated the current state of law enforcement training as it relates to assessing dangerousness and the risk for violence among persons with serious mental illness. It found that there is very little training and no risk assessment tool or guide currently available to assist law enforcement officers tasked with assessing <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> for dangerousness. Subsequently, this thesis examined alternative methods and models for assessing risk, including clinical violence risk assessments, and it conducted summary case studies. These included cases in which <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> committed acts of mass murder and cases where law enforcement successfully intervened and prevented <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons</b> from carrying out planned violence. As a result of this research and analysis, a field risk assessment guide has been developed and recommended for adoption to aid law enforcement officers in assessing the dangerousness of <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>persons.</b> Outstanding ThesisCaptain, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Minden, Nevad...|$|R

2500|$|Stalin's {{forgiveness}} for Kavtaradze has drawn interest from historians, {{as did the}} fact Stalin's attitudes toward his friend remained ambiguous after {{he was released from}} prison. In his Let History Judge, Roy Medvedev cites an episode occurring circa 1939, reported to him by Kavtaradze himself: during dinner at the Kremlin, Kavtaradze was addressed by Stalin the words [...] "And yet you wanted to kill me". Medvedev notes: [...] "Some historians may see this comment as proof of Stalin's paranoia. But Stalin knew well that Kavtaradze never tried to kill him. However, he could not admit this openly, for then {{he would have had to}} reconsider the execution of Budu Mdivani and many other Communists involved in the case. It was much simpler to 'forgive' Kavtaradze alone." [...] In his view, the case was similar to that of Alyosha Svanidze (the brother of Stalin's first wife Ekaterina Svanidze), who was shot after refusing to confess similar crimes. He concluded: [...] "All these actions reveal a misanthropic tyrant, not a <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person</b> who did not know what he was doing." [...] Reportedly, Sergey Kavtaradze himself believed that the conversation showed Stalin to be [...] "sick". Simon Sebag Montefiore, who places this event right after the Kavtaradzes' liberation, cites the line as: [...] "Nevertheless, you all wanted to kill me?", and gives Kavtaradze's reply to it as [...] "Do you really think so?" [...] He also records an exchange between Stalin and Sofia Kavtaradze: Stalin, looking at her hair (which had turned white in prison), commented [...] "We have tortured you too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} marry a person of a {{different}} race was addressed in Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. Advocates of substantive due process have sought to extend Loving {{in order to establish}} other rights (such as a right to same-sex marriage). A right to have children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that [...] "shock the conscience" [...] of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's ban on self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>person</b> who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to [...] "punishment" [...] for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v. Missouri, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies [...] "a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state." ...|$|E
