25|$|It is a finite-state {{machine that}} has an {{infinitely}} long read/write tape. The machine can move the tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an algorithm. The <b>machine</b> <b>starts</b> in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the wash}} cycle, the <b>machine</b> <b>starts</b> a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly {{distilled}} solvent dispensed from the solvent tank.

5000|$|The Synchro-Cyclotron, or Synchrocyclotron (SC), {{built in}} 1957, was CERN’s first accelerator.

2500|$|Turing now {{combines}} machines E and F into {{a composite}} <b>machine</b> G. G <b>starts</b> {{with the original}} M, then uses F to create all the successor-machines M1, M2,[...] [...], Mn. Then G uses E to test each <b>machine</b> <b>starting</b> with M. If E detects that a machine never prints a zero, G prints :0: for that machine. If E detects that a machine does print a 0 (we assume, Turing doesn’t say) then G prints :: or just skips this entry, leaving the squares blank. We can see that a couple things can happen.|$|R
50|$|However, GE's later, {{successful}} locomotives used Lemp's improved system, patented after World War I. The first GE diesel {{electric locomotive}} was a demonstrator, made to Lemp's specifications by {{a trio of}} GE, ALCO and Ingersoll-Rand, who made, respectively, the electrical equipment, {{the body and the}} engine. This <b>machine</b> <b>started</b> trials around New York City in 1924, sales of similar locomotives starting from 1925.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the first}} two films, terminators were Cyberdyne Systems models created after the war between man and <b>machines</b> <b>started.</b> In the altered {{timeline}} of T3 created by the destruction of Cyberdyne in T2, terminators were created by the Cyber Research Systems division of the U.S. Air Force to replace soldiers on the battlefield prior to Judgment Day, starting with the T-1.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of extreme failure, like a broken disk drive, etc., the {{replicated}} node can be recreated from an online backup of the live node.
