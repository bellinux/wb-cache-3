5|$|Following the Civil War, <b>minstrel</b> shows {{became the}} first distinctively American form of music expression. The <b>minstrel</b> show was an {{indigenous}} form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in blackface. <b>Minstrel</b> shows used African American elements in musical performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism. The <b>minstrel</b> show was invented by Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels. <b>Minstrel</b> shows produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After <b>minstrel</b> shows' popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular.|$|E
5|$|The song {{falls into}} the idiom of {{previous}} <b>minstrel</b> music, relying on rhythm and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its melody is simple and the harmony little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous <b>minstrel</b> fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that the song represents a transition between early <b>minstrel</b> music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years.|$|E

50|$|The {{music of}} the troubadours and trouvères was {{performed}} by <b>minstrels</b> called joglars (Occitan) or jongleurs (French). As early as 1321, the <b>minstrels</b> of Paris were formed into a guild. A guild of royal <b>minstrels</b> was organized in England in 1469. <b>Minstrels</b> were required to either join the guild or abstain from practicing their craft. Some <b>minstrels</b> were retained by lords as jesters who, in some cases, also practiced the art of juggling. Some were women, or women who followed <b>minstrels</b> in their travels. <b>Minstrels</b> throughout Europe also employed trained animals, such as bears. <b>Minstrels</b> in Europe died out slowly, having gone nearly extinct by about 1700, although isolated individuals working in the tradition existed even into the early 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The eldest brother Jerry, {{a veteran}} of the Ethiopian Serenaders, Campbell's <b>Minstrels,</b> E.P. Christy's <b>Minstrels</b> and other troupes, sang and played {{tambourine}} and bones. Dan Bryant, who had toured with Losee's <b>Minstrels,</b> the Sable Harmonists and Campbell's <b>Minstrels,</b> sang and played banjo. Neil (Cornelius) Bryant played accordion and flutina. Other members, including English-born fiddler Phil Isaacs, rounded out the original roster. All of the <b>minstrels</b> danced and acted in comedy segments, which were often improvised.|$|R

5|$|The closing titles use a {{different}} arrangement of the theme, sung by countertenor Jeremy Jackman, with lyrics (usually insulting Blackadder) that reflect {{the events of the}} preceding episode. The song is played over a shot of Blackadder strolling through a formal garden and being annoyed by the lute-wielding <b>minstrel</b> (Tony Aitken). This sequence was incorporated as a separate subplot, with Blackadder constantly attempting to apprehend the musician each time with limited success. At the end of the final episode, Blackadder catches the <b>minstrel</b> and repeatedly dunks him in a fountain.|$|E
50|$|On June 11, 1859 Moore {{sailed to}} England, where minstrelsy had become widely popular, and there joined the Christy <b>Minstrels</b> before in 1864 {{founding}} a Christy <b>Minstrels</b> company of his own. He {{was a member}} of the St. James's Hall <b>Minstrels</b> and, in 1871, founded the Moore and Burgess <b>Minstrels</b> with his partner Frederick Burgess.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in <b>minstrel</b> shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. <b>Minstrel</b> shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. <b>Minstrel</b> shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E
5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire <b>minstrel</b> troupe. The lead <b>minstrel</b> played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. <b>Minstrel</b> shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1440s, the royal court {{became aware that}} [...] "many rude husbandmen and artificers" [...] were posing as royal <b>minstrels</b> and {{charging}} money for their amateur performances. This defrauded the public, and cheated the real <b>minstrels</b> of income. In 1449, Henry VI therefore authorised William Langton (marshal of the <b>minstrels),</b> Walter Halliday, and five other royal <b>minstrels</b> to investigate these activities and to punish the impostors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Minstrels</b> {{performed}} songs whose lyrics {{told stories}} of distant places or of existing or imaginary historical events. Although <b>minstrels</b> {{created their own}} tales, often they would memorize and embellish the works of others. Frequently they were retained by royalty and high society. As the courts became more sophisticated, <b>minstrels</b> were eventually replaced at court by the troubadours, and many became wandering <b>minstrels,</b> performing in the streets; a decline in their popularity {{began in the late}} 15th century. <b>Minstrels</b> fed into later traditions of travelling entertainers, which continued to be moderately strong into the early 20th century, and which has some continuity in the form of today's buskers or street musicians.|$|R
5|$|Princess Kassandra of Troy is the story's protagonist, {{and it is}} {{told from}} her perspective. It begins when an elderly Kassandra tiredly agrees to correct the Homeric version of the Trojan War that is told by a {{traveling}} <b>minstrel.</b> Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles dictated by Trojan culture, and her inner turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E
5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a <b>Minstrel,</b> with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so it can be concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the <b>Minstrel</b> faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E
5|$|According to the Tales of the <b>Minstrel</b> of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E

5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent <b>Minstrel</b> attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s <b>minstrel</b> Blondel roamed (singing a song {{known only to}} him and Richard) to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade.|$|E

5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in <b>minstrel</b> shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind <b>minstrel</b> and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and <b>minstrel</b> troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
40|$|Scholarly {{interest}} in <b>minstrels</b> and their literature {{began in the}} eighteenth century. I have studied the most important works on this subject from that period {{up to the present}} day, and have concluded that although much material has been collected, it needs more discriminating classification and reconsideration within a fairly strict limit of time and place. I have therefore concentrated upon <b>minstrels</b> in England in the years between 1350 and 1400. The progress of scholarship has made available a number of records such as Household Accounts which contain many references to <b>minstrels</b> but which have not yet been systematically drawn on for evidence. I have confined my work to printed records, and have studied three account books in order to gather as much information as possible about the payment, functions,and status of <b>minstrels</b> in England {{in the second half of}} the fourteenth century. I have also examined the principal literary texts of this period for what authors say about <b>minstrels.</b> The fourteenth century metrical romances form an indigenous literary group which has been thought to possess a special relationship to <b>minstrels.</b> In an attempt to clarify this relationship, I have studied twenty representative romances for indications of audience level, authorship, and method of delivery. Other work relating to <b>minstrels</b> has been presented in Appendices. These include an appendix on the Tutbury <b>Minstrels</b> Court and Bull-running, the relationship between heralds and. <b>minstrels,</b> the musical instruments connected with minstrelsy, and a series of passages from the metrical romances indicating techniques relating to oral delivery...|$|R
