500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{wanted to}} {{contrast}} Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As {{a sequel to}} the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than {{he did when he}} voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations. During recording, Sakurai was told that [...] "o <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken." [...] Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling [...] "deflated", as the [...] "exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful", Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with straight talk. Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes. According to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of VII, Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording Crisis Core, Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a Final Fantasy VII fan himself, he is happy to contribute.|$|E

The proactive detection method has the better packet delivery ratio and correct detection probability, but suffered from the higher routing overhead due to the periodically broadcast packets. The reactive detection method eliminates the routing overhead problem from the event-driven way, but suffered from some packet loss {{in the beginning of}} routing procedure. Therefore, we recommend that a hybrid detection method which combined the advantages of proactive routing with reactive routing is the tendency to future research direction. However, we also discover that the attacker's misbehavior action is the key factor. The attackers are able to avoid the detection mechanism, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> routing detection used. Accordingly, some key encryption methods or hash-based methods are exploited to solve this problem. The black hole problem is still an active research area.

STZ-induced diabetic rats were given low-protein diet(5 □ protein in fodder, LPD group) or low-protein diet supplemented with α-keto acids(5 □ protein in fodder including 1 □ protein supplied by α-keto acids, LPD+α-KA group) or normal-protein diet(10 □protein in fodder, NPD group) for 8 weeks□The p 27 protein of glomerular lysate was detected with Western Blot. The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein(type IV collagen and fibronectin) of glomerular lysate and 24 h urine albumin were examined with ELISA□ Image analysis system was used to detect the diameter of each glomerulus. Glomerular p 27 protein increased in diabetic rats no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> diet were given, meanwhile,the 24 h urine albumin, glomerular ECM,glomerular diameter elevated as well as the ratio of kidney weight over body weight in diabetic rats□Both low-protein diet and low-protein diet supplemented with α-keto acids could attenuate changes occurred in diabetic rats with normal-protein diet□Glomerular p 27 level(8. 6 ± 2. 3 vs 11. 1 ± 3. 6,P〈 0. 01), 24  h urine albumin(13. 21 ± 2. 49) μg□ 24  h vs (18. 13 ± 3. 23) μg□ 24  h,P〈 0. 01,glomerular diameter(652 ± 73) μm 2 vs (721 ± 75) μm 2,P〈 0. 05,and the ratio of kidney weight over body weight(11. 02 ± 1. 72 vs 12. 03 ± 1. 85,P〈 0. 05) were lower in LPD+α-KA group than LPD group.
