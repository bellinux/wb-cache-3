25|$|Landfills {{are often}} the most {{cost-efficient}} way to dispose of waste, especially in countries like the United States with large open spaces. While resource recovery and incineration both require extensive investments in infrastructure, and <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> also requires extensive manpower to maintain, landfills have fewer fixed—or ongoing—costs, allowing them to compete favorably. In addition, landfill gas can be upgraded to natural gas—landfill gas utilization—which is a potential revenue stream. Another advantage is having a specific location for disposal that can be monitored, where waste can be processed to remove all recyclable materials before tipping.|$|E
25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce landfilling. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with <b>material</b> <b>recovery,</b> which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, torrefaction of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant will be using.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{municipalities}} {{that operate}} incineration facilities have higher recycling rates than neighboring {{cities and counties}} that do not send their waste to incinerators.. In a country overview from 2016 [...] by the European Environmental Agency the top recycling performing countries are also the ones having the highest penetration of incineration, even though all <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> from waste sent to incineration (e.g. metals and construction aggregate) is per definition not counted as recycling in European targets. [...] The recovery of glass, stone and ceramic materials reused in construction, as well as ferrous {{and in some cases}} non-ferrous metals recovered from combustion residue thus adds further to the actual recycled amounts. Metals recovered from ash would typically be difficult or impossible to recycle through conventional means, as the removal of attached combustible material through incineration provides an alternative to labor- or energy-intensive mechanical separation methods.|$|E
2500|$|The waste {{hierarchy}} {{refers to the}} [...] "3 Rs" [...] reduce, reuse and recycle, which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation. The {{waste hierarchy}} remains the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste; see: resource recovery. The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action {{is to reduce the}} generation of waste i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which would include composting. Following this step is <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> and waste-to-energy. Energy can be recovered from processes i.e. landfill and combustion, at this level of the hierarchy. The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered. The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.|$|E

40|$|Tradable-permit schemes are {{becoming}} an increasingly popular technique for encouraging <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> and {{the diversion of}} waste from landfill. Such schemes operate using various forms of market-based trading of waste permits between polluters but usually rely on mandatory recycling targets to provide an incentive for trading. Using the UK's Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) scheme as a template, this paper examines the potential for permit trading where mandatory targets are absent and schemes must be driven solely by the financial benefits of reduced landfill costs and permit/material sales. The case examined is sterilized clinical waste, which has considerable recycling potential but Suffers from health concerns and a poor public image. Interviews with healthcare and waste-management representatives indicate that although elements of the PRN scheme might prove appropriate for encouraging <b>materials</b> <b>recovery,</b> the absence of government targets and uncertain end markets for sterilized clinical waste present major obstacles to trading. Alternative incentives would therefore be required to catalyse schemes and develop recycling infrastructure. In the final analysis, thermal processing {{may be a more}} practical alternative to landfill than <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> for this particular waste stream...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{recycling as}} an economic activity, locating it in debates about economization, marketization and performativity. It argues that recycling is a reflexive intervention in economic activity which extends the boundaries of markets, by internalizing objects formerly externalized as wastes and by attending to the temporal properties of materials. It differentiates between activities based on manufacturing recycled products and the activities of <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> linked to commodity markets in secondary materials. By taking the in vivo economic experiment resulting from the UK's Ship Recycling Strategy as its empirical focus, the paper demonstrates how recycling connects to wider debates about experimentation and the constitution of markets, and shows the importance of assaying and assay devices as market devices to the economization of recycling. It further shows that, in <b>materials</b> <b>recovery,</b> measurement is estimation and things are hard to pacify. This makes recycling difficult to stabilize {{as an economic}} activity. The consequences are considerable: notably, the possibility of economic failure can threaten to contaminate stabilized (or ‘cold’) forms of politics. The importance of contracts {{as a means to}} securing politicized markets in secondary <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> is indicated...|$|R
