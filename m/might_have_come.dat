5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent had {{informed}} Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April, for an election on June 10. A final parliamentary conflict was {{sparked by the}} suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman {{in the midst of}} allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links. Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public, and defended him again after his death, suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false. It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Canadian intelligence sources, and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties' foreign policy critics, Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth, but had passed a security review. The minister evaded further questions regarding what information had been provided, and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12.|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Mirza puzzled researchers {{for many}} years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names—a trend not only continued with {{his description of}} Mirza in 1870, {{but also with the}} genera Phaner (fork-marked lemurs) and Azema (for M.rufus, now a synonym for Microcebus), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For Mirza, Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mîrzâ ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Arabian Nights, a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19November1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} at symbolic appropriation from a power-based discourse about the exoticism of Soqotra rather than a direct dialogue with the inhabitants. Eurocentric perspective has weakened any possible dialogue with inhabitants that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>came</b> about in the first place.

25|$|One {{surviving}} {{group of}} stories suggests how Hecate <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to {{be incorporated into}} the Greek pantheon without affecting the privileged position of Artemis. Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with Iphigeneia. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal's suicide. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, where the priests, megabyzi, officiated.|$|E

Nelson speculates that Henry, like many African Americans <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the Civil War.

25|$|That they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> southeast, {{from the}} center of Nye-Cartwright Ridge, seems to be {{supported}} by Northern Cheyenne accounts of seeing the approach of the distinctly white-colored horses of Company E, known as the Grey Horse Company. Its approach was seen by Indians at that end of the village. Behind them, a second company, further up on the heights, would have provided long-range cover fire. Warriors could have been drawn to the feint attack, forcing the battalion back towards the heights, up the north fork drainage, away from the troops providing cover fire above. The covering company would have moved towards a reunion, delivering heavy volley fire and leaving the trail of expended cartridges discovered 50 years later.|$|E
25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard to tell where the Sumerians <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time.

25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst. These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E
