40|$|A {{method of}} {{representing}} multivariate data as cartoon faces was originated by Chernoff (1971). It {{is useful for}} a first look at or overview {{of a set of}} data. The ruga pattern is a complex structure which under purely visual observation is meaningless, and as a set of data it also says nothing to the casual observer. As a Chernoff face, however, the visual impact is immediate. Palatal rugae as Chernoff faces have now been used to try to establish family groupings and possibly to identify the parentage of a child. Three families out of a sample of 17 were randomly selected. Ruga pattern classification was carried out and 10 of the variables which are not affected by growth were used to draw faces. Twenty-four observers were asked to <b>match</b> <b>each</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> a set of parents. The number of correct matchings were then counted, as were the incidences of similar matching correct or incorrect. It was found that matching was easier in certain families (observers consistently achieved higher scores), that the incidence of 2, 3 or 4 correct placings was constant and that observers tended to be consistent in their matching (right or wrong).

Methods We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to conduct a nested case-control study. We identified a JIA cohort and <b>matched</b> <b>each</b> JIA <b>child</b> <b>with</b> non-JIA <b>children</b> for comparison.

40|$|Abstract: In resource-constrained {{classrooms}} {{in the developing}} world, {{it is common for}} several students to share each computer. Unfortunately, dominance behavior often naturally emerges in these situations, when one child monopolizes the mouse and keyboard. One way to mitigate this phenomenon is by providing <b>each</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> a mouse and a corresponding onscreen cursor so that everyone can interact. Though such multiple-mouse configurations reduce the possibility of total domination by one individual, they do not automatically eliminate dominance behavior completely. We propose the use of a design for small-group learning on shared computers based on enforced turn-taking in a split-screen, multiple-mouse environment. In an evaluation with 104 rural schoolchildren in India, we found that dominance behavior was indeed reduced through these design choices...|$|R
