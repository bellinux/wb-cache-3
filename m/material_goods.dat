5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through <b>material</b> <b>goods,</b> so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality <b>material</b> <b>goods</b> for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The Naqada culture {{manufactured}} {{a diverse}} selection of <b>material</b> <b>goods,</b> {{reflective of the}} increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines. During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.|$|E

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} <b>material</b> <b>goods</b> and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

Caring little for money or <b>material</b> <b>goods,</b> Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E

The two questions, jointly considered, allow to reconstruct a network describing who visits whom within each village. The same stands for questions 4 – 5, 6 – 7 and 8 – 9, which allow to reconstruct, respectively, the network of potential <b>material</b> <b>good</b> loans, of potential money loans, and of advice relationships. Therefore, from the 12 questions we identify 8 different dimensions: nonrelative socialisation (1), house visits (2 – 3), <b>material</b> <b>good</b> potential loans (4 – 5), money potential loans (6 – 7), advice exchange (8 – 9), help in a medical emergency (10), kinship (11), and praying company (12).|$|R
