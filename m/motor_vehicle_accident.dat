Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E

25|$|Zopiclone causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} search {{epidemiological}} and clinical properties of childhood deaths from autopsy records in Afyonkarahisar. Method: Republic prosecution files, autopsy reports, evident place investigations and death examination protocols of 122 cases among children 0 to 17 years are searched. Results: Seventy five (61. 5 %) of 122 were boys, and {{mean age of}} them was 9. 1 ± 5. 4. The highest mortality was among children 5 to 9 years with 36 (29. 5 %) cases. Prominent mortality causes of trauma were <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> (% 59. 8). The origin of mortality causes were accidents (103 cases (% 84. 4)), suicide (11 cases (% 9. 0)) and homicide (8 cases (% 6. 6)). Mortality from <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> was most frequent (% 34. 2) among children 5 to 9 years. Thirty five (42. 0 %) of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> were from trauma in vehicles. The most frequent wounded sides of the body were head and neck region (69. 7 %). Autopcy was performed in 26 (21. 3 %) cases. Conclusion: <b>Motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> and falls are the leading causes in childhood traumas and <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> were mostly as pedestrian traumas. Mostly head and neck injuries were experienced and deaths were on scene. Besides, judicious physical evaluation may be enough to diagnose the mortality cause...|$|R

40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> are {{the leading}} cause of death for young people ages 15 to 20 in the United States. 1 For-tunately, over the last ten years, there has been a signif-icant decline in teen driver {{fatalities}}. Between 2003 and 2012, fatalities dropped 49 % – from 7, 937 to 4, 283. 2 In Rhode Island, unintentional injury from <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> is also a leading cause of death for young people ages 15 to 24. The rate of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities within this age group is substantially higher than any other. 3 Research has shown that teen drivers are especially at risk for fatal <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> because they lack experience and judgment. 4 Presence of passengers, night driving, drinking, and non-use of seatbelts are all factors that further jeopardize a young driver’s safety. 5 This report aims to summarize the relevant circum-stances around fatal <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> in Rhode Island involving youth from 2008 to 2013.

25|$|Psychologically {{traumatic}} experiences often involve physical {{trauma that}} threatens one's survival {{and sense of}} security. Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, paternalism, domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accident,</b> mass interpersonal violence like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures like sex trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Harcourt took a {{leave of}} absence from the British Army and in 1929 he {{travelled}} to Australia. He eventually applied for a discharge from the army and decided to settle in Victoria. Later he moved to Tasmania where he took a job with the government and became a civil servant. He also became involved in the Boy Scouts and in 1933 he served as secretary and organiser of the first World Scout Jamboree to be held in Australia, taking place over Christmas 1933–34. On 28 April 1939, while he was working with the Youth Employment Office in Hobart, Harcourt was involved in a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> at Kings Meadows, Launceston. While attempting to take evasive action to avoid hitting a car that was driving {{on the wrong side of}} the road, Harcourt's car collided with a pedestrian who had been walking on the road.

500|$|While {{urbanisation}} {{can pose}} a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present. Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: collisions with vehicles and attacks by domestic dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year. Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In a 30-year retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, [...] trauma (usually resulting from a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of Chlamydia infection. Wildlife caretakers are issued special permits, but must release the animals back into the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough. As with most native animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia or anywhere else.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} her third {{trimester}} {{was involved in a}} <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>accident,</b> and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact [...] The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators {{came to the conclusion that}} the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
