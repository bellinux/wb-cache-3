5|$|S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 {{mentions}} the <b>Métis</b> yet there {{has long been}} debate over legally defining the term <b>Métis,</b> but on September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that <b>Métis</b> are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).|$|E
5|$|<b>Métis</b> {{scholars}} {{have noted that}} Riel is a more important figure to non-Métis than to Métis; {{he is the only}} <b>Métis</b> figure most non-Métis are aware of. Political scientists such as Thomas Flanagan have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and millenarian cults.|$|E
5|$|Due to tidal locking, <b>Metis</b> rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|First Nations and Inuit {{organizations}} {{ranged in}} size from band societies of a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. First Nations leaders {{from across the country}} formed the Assembly of First Nations, which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968. The <b>Métis</b> and the Inuit are represented nationally by the <b>Métis</b> National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was {{the site}} of the Red River Rebellion, a {{conflict}} between the local provisional government of <b>Métis,</b> led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. <b>Métis</b> legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metis</b> has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, {{which makes it}} the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of <b>Metis</b> are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metis</b> is the fastest-moving of Jupiter's moons. It orbits Jupiter at 31.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and {{incorporated}} into the Northwest Territories; a {{lack of attention to}} <b>Métis</b> concerns caused <b>Métis</b> leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the Red River Rebellion. In response, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870. Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile. The Canadian government blocked the Métis' attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba's entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of <b>Métis</b> moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Canadian Census {{enumerated}} 1,400,685 Aboriginal {{people in}} Canada, 4.3% of the country's total population. This total comprises 851,560 people of First Nations descent, 451,795 <b>Métis,</b> and 59,445 Inuit. National representative bodies of Aboriginal people in Canada include the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the <b>Métis</b> National Council, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the National Association of Native Friendship Centres and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest again saw unrest. Many of the Manitoban <b>Métis</b> {{had moved}} into the territories. Negotiations between the <b>Métis</b> and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult, Riel had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, he journeyed to Regina with the {{connivance}} of Macdonald's government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with. Instead, the <b>Métis</b> rose the following year under Riel in the North-West Rebellion. Macdonald put down the rebellion with militia troops transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. The hanging of Riel proved bitterly controversial, and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally French Canadian) from the Conservatives—they soon realign themselves with the Liberals.|$|E
5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the <b>Métis</b> river lots in accordance with their wishes. The <b>Métis</b> did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The <b>Métis</b> themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal peoples {{include the}} Innu, Inuit and <b>Métis</b> of Labrador and the Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland. One {{aboriginal}} group, the Beothuks became extinct {{in the early}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although the Juno orbiter, which {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called JunoCam, {{it is almost}} entirely focused on {{observations}} of Jupiter itself. However, {{if all goes well}} it should be able to capture some limited images of the innermost moons <b>Metis</b> and Adrastea.|$|E
5|$|Amongst notable <b>Métis</b> {{people are}} {{television}} actor Tom Jackson, Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Tony Whitford, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885, {{which ended in}} his trial.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{secured the}} {{territory}} in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, {{better known as}} the French and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the <b>Métis.</b> Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one <b>Métis</b> were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the Republic of Manitobah in 1867, that he and his council named.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, MP Pat Martin {{introduced}} a motion into the House of Commons {{calling on the}} government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's First Nations, Inuit and <b>Métis</b> peoples.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's {{culture has}} been {{influenced}} by traditional (Aboriginal and <b>Métis)</b> and modern Canadian artistic values, {{as well as by}} the cultures of its immigrant populations and American neighbours. The Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture. Manitoba is the birthplace of the Red River Jig, a combination of aboriginal pow-wows and European reels popular among early settlers. Manitoba's traditional music has strong roots in <b>Métis</b> and Aboriginal culture, in particular the old-time fiddling of the <b>Métis.</b> Manitoba's cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Winnipeg-based Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB), is Canada's oldest ballet and North America's longest continuously operating ballet company; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen Elizabeth II. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO) performs classical music and new compositions at the Centennial Concert Hall. Manitoba Opera, founded in 1969, also performs out of the Centennial Concert Hall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metis</b> is the {{innermost}} of Jupiter's four small inner moons. It orbits Jupiter {{at a distance}} of ~128,000km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter's main ring. Metis's orbit has very small eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Of <b>Métis</b> heritage, Bourque has {{initiated}} several charitable causes dedicated to encouraging aboriginal children and helping youth from rural Northern Alberta afford {{the cost of}} playing hockey.|$|E
5|$|Riel was {{the eldest}} of eleven {{children}} in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Ojibwa <b>Métis</b> descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a <b>Métis</b> imprisoned for challenging the HBC's historical trade monopoly. Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore {{well known in the}} Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest white families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Métis</b> {{are people}} descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French) and Cree, Ojibway, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations. Their history {{dates to the}} mid-17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} halo rings consist of dust {{ejected from the}} moons <b>Metis,</b> Adrastea, and other unobserved parent bodies {{as the result of}} {{high-velocity}} impacts. High-resolution images obtained in February and March 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{population of}} the Red River had historically been <b>Métis</b> and First Nation people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the Macdonald government from Bishop Taché and the HBC governor William Mactavish that any such activity would precipitate unrest, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered {{a survey of the}} area. The arrival on 20 August 1869 of a survey party headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis increased anxiety among the <b>Métis.</b> The <b>Métis</b> did not possess title to their land, which was in any case laid out according to the seigneurial system rather than in English-style square lots.|$|E
5|$|Unlike First Nations {{people and}} Inuit, {{there has been}} no {{distinction}} between status and non-status, and the <b>Métis,</b> their heritage and Aboriginal ancestry have often been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 4,205 members of visible {{minorities}} in the city. The largest visible minority group were South Asians (1.2%), followed by Chinese Canadian (1.0%), and Blacks (0.9%). There were 4,305 Aboriginals in St. John's, comprising 4.1% of the city's population. First Nations people made up 2.9% of the city's population, Inuit comprised 0.8% of St. John's population, and 0.6% were <b>Métis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Metis</b> is tidally locked to Jupiter, and {{its shape}} is {{strongly}} asymmetrical, {{with one of}} the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It {{is also one of the}} two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metis</b> lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|Of Alberta's 354 {{municipalities}}, 266 of {{them are}} urban municipalities (18 cities, 108 towns, 89 villages and 51 summer villages), 5 are specialized municipalities, 75 are rural municipalities (64 municipal districts, 8 improvement districts and 3 special areas) and 8 are <b>Metis</b> settlements. The MGA, the SAA and the MSA stipulate governance of these municipalities. Alberta's Ministry of Municipal Affairs is responsible for providing provincial services to municipalities.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside <b>Métis</b> representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the <b>Métis</b> point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{municipalities}} in Alberta include municipal districts (counties), improvement {{districts and}} special areas. For federal census purposes, Statistics Canada recognizes all three rural municipality types as census subdivisions. However, Statistics Canada embeds Alberta's eight <b>Metis</b> settlements, a separate type of municipality, into the census subdivisions for six municipal districts.|$|E
5|$|Some asteroids {{share the}} same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 <b>Metis,</b> 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids {{previously}} shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{assigned}} Belcourt to Pembina, North Dakota as {{a missionary}} to the Chippewa and <b>Métis</b> of the Pembina River basin, a tributary to the Red River of the North. Upon arrival at Pembina, Belcourt constructed a small log cabin of 20 feet long by 30 feet wide, {{which was not}} large enough {{for all of his}} congregation. On August 14, 1848, the missionary baptised his first person in Pembina, and held a Holy Communion class consisting of 92 Native Americans. Needing more resources, Belcourt wrote to the Archbishop of Quebec for money for food and building supplies. He also asked for another Canadian priest well-versed in both French and the Chippewa language, as he noted there were more <b>Métis</b> than Chippewa in the Pembina area. Belcourt described the original territory of the Chippewa in the Pembina district as several hundred miles north to south, and east to west - much larger than the small reservation to which they were later assigned.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Settlement was a {{community}} in Rupert's Land nominally administered by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and largely inhabited by First Nations tribes and the <b>Métis,</b> an ethnic group of mixed Cree, Ojibwa, Saulteaux, French Canadian, Scottish, and English descent. Louis Riel was born there in 1844, near modern Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Louis Riel, Sr. and Julie Lagimodière.|$|E
5|$|The {{lake was}} known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies. Thomas Spence chose the name {{to refer to a}} new {{republic}} he proposed for the area south of the lake. <b>Métis</b> leader Louis Riel also chose the name, and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} <b>Metis</b> is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} (First Nations, Inuit and <b>Métis)</b> {{distinctive}} groups of North America indigenous peoples {{recognized in the}} Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, sections 25 and 35. Under the Employment Equity Act, Aboriginal people are a designated group along with women, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities. They are not a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act and {{in the view of}} Statistics Canada.|$|E
