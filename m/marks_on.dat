5|$|In 2012, bite <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. Great white shark hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey.

5|$|Distinguishing S.grandis {{from the}} other four New World species of Sphecius (S.convallis, S.hogardii, S. speciosus, S.spectabilis) is difficult. The female S.convallis was {{originally}} distinguished from the female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S.convallis and yellow <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> all tergites for S.grandis. However, this {{was found to be}} insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E
5|$|Osmólska and Roniewicz {{reported}} that the holotype specimen has abnormal pits, grooves and tubercles on {{the first and second}} phalanx of the left second finger that {{may be the result of}} injuries to the joint between the two bones. The damage may have caused changes to the arrangement of ligaments of muscles. The two coracoids are also differently developed. A rib of specimen MPC-D 100/127 shows a healed trauma which has remodelled the bone. In 2012, bite <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> two gastralia of the holotype specimen were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation.

The ancient Egyptians recognised the hippo as a ferocious denizen of the Nile and representations on the tombs of nobles show that the animals were hunted.|$|E

Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory.

5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> {{the face that}} were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E

On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland.

5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
