25|$|Spectral skewing is {{the change}} in {{relative}} intensity of <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral skewing is not observed in ion trap (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "hard ionization" [...] {{process of}} {{electron}} ionization can be softened by the cooling of the molecules before their ionization, resulting in mass spectra that are richer in information. In this method named cold electron ionization (Cold-EI) the molecules exit the GC column, mixed with added helium make up gas and expand into vacuum through {{a specially designed}} supersonic nozzle, forming a supersonic molecular beam (SMB). Collisions with the make up gas at the expanding supersonic jet reduce the internal vibrational (and rotational) energy of the analyte molecules, hence reducing the degree of fragmentation caused by the electrons during the ionization process. Cold-EI mass spectra are characterized by an abundant molecular ion while the usual fragmentation pattern is retained, thus making Cold-EI mass spectra compatible with library search identification techniques. The enhanced molecular ions increase the identification probabilities of both known and unknown compounds, amplify isomer <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> effects and enable the use of isotope abundance analysis for the elucidation of elemental formulae.|$|E

40|$|Hagedorn {{states are}} {{characterized}} by being very massive hadron-like resonances and by not being limited to quantum numbers of known hadrons. To generate such a zoo of different Hagedorn states, a covariantly formulated bootstrap equation is solved by ensuring energy conservation and conservation of baryon number $B$, strangeness $S$ and electric charge $Q$. The numerical solution of this equation provides Hagedorn spectra, which enable to obtain the decay width for Hagedorn states needed in cascading decay simulations. A single (heavy) Hagedorn state cascades by various two-body decay channels subsequently into final stable hadrons. All final hadronic observables like <b>masses,</b> <b>spectral</b> functions and decay branching ratios for hadronic feed down are taken from the hadronic transport model UrQMD.

The discovery of {{an increasing number of}} extrasolar planets showing a vast variety of planetary parameters, like Keplerian orbital elements and environmental parameters, like stellar <b>masses,</b> <b>spectral</b> types, metallicity etc., prompts the development of a planetary taxonomy. In this work via principal component analysis followed by hierarchical clustering analysis, we report the definition of five robust groups of planets. We also discuss the physical relevance of such analysis, which may provide a valid basis for disentangling the role of the several physical parameters involved in the processes of planet formation and subsequent evolution. For instance, we were able to divide the hot Jupiters into two main groups {{on the basis of their}} stellar masses and metallicities. Moreover, for some groups, we find strong correlations between metallicity, semi-major axis and eccentricity. The implications of these findings are discussed.

40|$|Spectral {{estimation}} of nonstationary but harmonizable processes is considered. Given a single {{realization of the}} process, periodogram-like and consistent estimators are proposed for <b>spectral</b> <b>mass</b> estimation when the spectral support of the process consists of lines. Such a process can arise in signals of a moving source from array data or multipath signals with Doppler stretch from a single receiver. Such processes also include periodically correlated (or cyclostationary) and almost periodically correlated processes as special cases. We give detailed analysis on aliasing, bias and covariances of various estimators. It is shown that dividing a single long realization of the process into nonoverlapping subsections and then averaging periodogramlike estimates formed from each subsection will not yield meaningful results if one is estimating <b>spectral</b> <b>mass</b> with support on lines with slope not equal to 1.

50|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{coupled to}} mass spectrometry (MS) {{is one of}} the most widespread routine technologies applied to the large scale screening and discovery of novel biomarkers in metabolomics. However, the majority of MSTs currently measured in plant metabolomic profiling experiments remains unidentified due to the lack of authenticated pure reference substances and the expensive and time-consuming effort to maintain <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> RI libraries required for compound identification by GC-MS.As the communication of analytical results and other approach-related details such as <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> and RI reference information within the scientific community is becoming increasingly popular, open access platforms for information exchange, such as the GMD, are obligatory.Due to the lack of mandatory standards it remains difficult to compare individual mass spectrums. While the different mass detector technologies, namely quadrupole, ion trap and time of flight, can be deemed irrelevant, the chromatography settings such as temperature programming, type of capillary column and choice of column manufacturer heavily affect the empirically determined RI properties. Procedures for the transfer of RI properties between chromatography variants are, therefore, highly relevant for a shared library use. The GMD assesses the accuracy of RI transfer between chromatography variants and implements means to transfer empirically determined RI properties.Aiming at the classification and identification of un-identified MSTs, the GMD accesses the information on available reference compounds. These compounds serve as training set of data to apply decision trees (DT) as a supervised machine learning approach. Structural feature extraction was applied to classify the metabolite space of the GMD prior to DT training. DT-based predictions of the most frequent substructures classify low resolution GC-MS mass spectra of the linked (potentially unknown) metabolite with respect to the presence or absence of the chemical moieties.The web-based frontend supports conventional <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> and RI comparison by ranked hit lists as well as advanced DT supported substructure prediction. Batch processing is enabled via Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based web services while web-based data access services expose particular data base entities adapting Representational State Transfer (ReST) principles and <b>mass</b> <b>spectral</b> standards such as NIST-MSP and JCAMP-DX.The GMD visualise quantitative metabolite pool size changes data.|$|E

Solid-phase extraction technology was employed for sample purification and enrichment.
