5|$|Aldershot {{qualified}} for the play-offs again in 2004–05, and Challinor played in both semi-final matches against Carlisle United, which ended in a 2–2 draw on aggregate. Challinor <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> penalty kick in the penalty shoot-out, before Danny Livesey scored the penalty that secured Carlisle's place in the play-off final. Having finished the season with nine goals in 44 appearances, Challinor was released by Aldershot on 18 May 2005, despite being rated {{as one of the}} best attacking midfielders in the Conference National.|$|E
5|$|At the 2016 United States Olympic Trials, the U.S. {{qualifying}} {{meet for}} the Rio Olympics, Lochte {{finished third in}} the 400-meter individual medley, just missing out on an Olympic berth.

Lochte finally qualified for an individual event by finishing second in the 200-meter individual medley behind Phelps.|$|E

A 56-yard punt {{in the first quarter}} marked the ninth consecutive game he had a kick of at least 50 yards. Virginia Tech placekicker Dustin Keys <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> first field goal attempt of the game but successfully converted his next two kicks, giving him 23 field goals and the Tech single-season record in that category.|$|E

Horford started in his place.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{finished}} {{in third place}} on Election Day, far behind Dukakis and the victorious George H.W. Bush. He received 431,750 votes, which made up 0.47% of the overall vote. He received 203,639 more votes than the Bergland/Lewis ticket four years prior. The largest percentage won by Paul came in Alaska, where he received 2.74%. In Washington, he <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> goal of 5% with a 0.92% showing. In Utah, Paul received 1.16%.|$|E
5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who had <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored twice {{in the last quarter of}} an hour to take the game 4–3.|$|E

5|$|The game {{descended into}} a scrappy affair {{in the last}} few minutes, with few clear cut chances for either side. With no further goals, it was decided by penalties. Scholes, Edu and Ferdinand {{converted}} their kicks, before Howard saved Van Bronkhorst's effort. Van Nistelrooy <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> and Wiltord scored to level the tally at 2–2 in the shoot-out. Solskjær, Lauren and Forlán scored, but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield, 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
5|$|The {{next three}} British ships, Vanguard {{in the lead}} {{followed}} by HMS Minotaur and HMS Defence, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship's fire on Spartiate, while Captain Thomas Louis in Minotaur attacked the unengaged Aquilon and Captain John Peyton in Defence joined the attack on Peuple Souverain. With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic, passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain Henry Darby on Bellerophon <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> intended anchor near Franklin and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain George Blagdon Westcott on Majestic also <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> station and almost collided with Heureux, coming under heavy fire from Tonnant. Unable to stop in time, Westcott's jib boom became entangled with Tonnants shroud.|$|E
5|$|Abel {{attempted}} eight passes {{during the}} game, and completed just three {{for a total}} of 65 yards. Of Abel's five incompletions, two were interceptions.

George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards, gaining 87 {{over the course of the}} game, and scoring Washington's only rushing touchdown. Kinsley Dubois came next, gaining 30 yards, followed by Abel, with 20. The remainder of the team's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others, including Tesreau. Washington's kicker Leonard Zeil was two for two on extra points, but <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> only field goal attempt. Washington punted nine times, averaging 33 yards per attempt.|$|E

5|$|Al-Talaba {{returned}} to winning ways under {{the management of}} Jamal Ali in the 1988–89 season, which was played in a different format to previous seasons. They finished fourth in the Baghdad Group, just ahead of Al-Shorta, {{to qualify for the}} final tournament, where they finished second in Group 1, behind Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba defeated Al-Tayaran 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. In the final, Al-Talaba faced their rivals, Al-Rasheed, at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended 1–1 at full time with their goal scored by Ali Hussein. It went to penalties where Hussein Saeed <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> penalty and enabled Al-Rasheed to win 5–4. That season, Al-Talaba also finished as runners-up in the Al-Intisar Cup, behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya.|$|E
5|$|Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell {{completed}} 11 of 16 {{passes for}} 189yards, one touchdown, and one interception, {{and was named}} the game's most valuable player. Despite his performance, he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game. Auburn kicker John Vaughn was successful on all three of his field goal attempts and also succeeded on his sole extra point kick in the game, resulting in 10Auburn points. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38passes for 299yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Virginia Tech kicker Branden Pace <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> sole field goal attempt of the game, a 23-yard kick.|$|E

On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E

5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving {{from side to side}} along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{rejoined the}} Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief {{time there was}} unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, which was a {{disappointment}} to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E

It {{was supposed to be}} a longer-term position, but he <b>missed</b> <b>his</b> wife and new daughter and decided not to return after his first holiday back to the UK. BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to Midlands Today at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances. One of the earliest stories he covered for them was the murder of Carl Bridgewater, the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.|$|E

Hunt returned a week later and scored a try {{in each of the}} next three games. However, he only scored three more tries in the remaining sixteen weeks of the season.
