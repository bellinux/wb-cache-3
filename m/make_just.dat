Early in the game Lindsay was expected to pull off another career high. Only seven minutes after Lindsay was in the game she was caught elbowing {{a player in the}} face.

500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?'

[...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD.

Still, sometimes two disparate things can merge to create a unique synergy that makes the melding work, however unlikely it may have seemed at the outset." [...] In GamePro, Sid Shuman called it [...] "surprisingly enjoyable." [...] Wired.com's preview stated {{that the concept of}} the game was [...] "nose-pokingly ludicrous", noting that Superman's powers could be used to easily defeat a character with the comment, [...] "from Sub-Zero to Well-Done in eight seconds flat." [...] ABC News praised the game's story because it did [...] "a great job of giving players a cohesive, if far-fetched, story line that's fun if not engaging," [...] as well as [...] "comic book-like" [...] dialogue. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universes Kombo Challenge mode was criticized as a thin and frustrating mode with combos that required very precise timing. The modes of Klose Kombat and Free-fall Kombat were praised as concepts but were criticized in their execution as they appeared to slow the gameplay down and took the player out of the fast gameplay experience. Critics noted that the change in the amount of gore was disappointing to longtime fans of the series who were used to the [...] "insane amounts of gore." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} after the {{military}} invasion of Iraq, O'Brien sent March 25, 2003 an explicit letter to US Catholic military chaplains, writing [...] "Given the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments, and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience (nota : [...] "our leadership" [...] is not referring to the Pope)... It is to be hoped that all factors which have led to our intervention will eventually be made public, and... will shed helpful light upon our President's decision". Knowing to be a target for Catholic war opponents as increasingly distancing himself from the Pope's sayings and from some statements expressed at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ("A preemptive war against Iraq is an unjust war"), O'Brien wrote this letter without endorsing the motives of the war. However, it is acknowledged that the proponents of the Iraqi war cause were comforted by his positions. Nevertheless, after the war has started, his spiritual direction proved to be efficient in helping calm the doubts of soldiers, advising them that they can safely leave the responsibility for moral decision-making to the Government. On several occasions, US Army chaplains including O'Brien were asked by Catholics [...] "to call on all Catholic soldiers to leave Iraq" [...] : O'Brien gave flat refusals for discussions. O'Brien thinks that, to <b>make</b> <b>Just</b> War, the role of chaplains becomes essential to help soldiers perform their fighting duties, to ease relationships with local populations and to avoid gross misconducts (such as torturing in the Abu Ghraib prison). In such a context, O'Brien is often complaining that the paucity of priests serving in active duty in the US Army is nearing disaster.|$|E
