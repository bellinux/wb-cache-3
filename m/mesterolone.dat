25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, <b>mesterolone,</b> and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives <b>mesterolone</b> and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, <b>mesterolone</b> (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E

2500|$|Natural AAS like {{testosterone}} and DHT {{and synthetic}} AAS are analogues {{of each other}} and are very similar structurally. For this reason, they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same enzymes. According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is based on its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products. As an example, whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an AAS that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or has already been 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like <b>mesterolone</b> or drostanolone), would not experience such potentiation in said tissues. Moreover, nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself, and this results in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues. As so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues such as skin/hair follicles and reproductive tissues are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic-androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone, as well as with various other AAS.|$|E

Transgenic mice with a human lipaemic phenotype (expressing cholesteryl ester transfer protein on the LDL receptor knockout background) were used in this study. Sedentary and exercised mice (treadmill running, five times per week for 6 weeks) were treated with <b>mesterolone</b> (2 μg/g body weight) or vehicle (control-C) in the last 3 weeks. Four groups were compared: (i) exercise + <b>mesterolone</b> (Ex-M), (ii) exercise + vehicle (Ex-C), (iii) sedentary + <b>mesterolone</b> (Sed-M) and (iv) sedentary + vehicle (Sed-C).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anabolic-androgenic steroid {{compounds}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely abused drugs by athletes and muscle builders with the goal of improving performance/ability, appearance, or muscle mass. In addition, these steroids are widely used in the treatment of male infertility and subfertility. However, increasing concern has been shown that these compounds may not only offer unappreciable benefits to infertile and subfertile males, but might have deleterious effects on both human and animal physiology and sperm quality. There is a dearth of knowledge on the structural and quantitative changes of the testis secondary to this group of compounds. Objective: The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of <b>mesterolone</b> (proviron), an anabolic-androgenic steroid, on some of the histomorphometric and stereological parameters of the seminiferous tubules in Sprague-Dawley rat. Materials and Methods: Two groups of 10 adult male rats were used. The treated group was given 0. 06 mg/kg body weight/day of <b>mesterolone</b> by gavage for six weeks while the control group received equal volume of 0. 9 % normal saline per day. Five µm of uniformly random serial sections of the processed testicular tissues were analyzed using un-biased stereological and histomorphometric studies. Results: The results showed that the percentage mean volume density of both the tubular lumen and epithelial height increased by 35 % (p< 0. 05) and decreased by 50 % (p< 0. 05), respectively compared to the control. <b>mesterolone</b> also caused a significant decline in sperm concentration.

In this study, 6 days post-hatched fry (swim-up stage) were immersed with either MT or <b>mesterolone</b> at different concentrations (125, 250 or 500 μgL - 1). One hundred and forty swim-up fry were allocated to each of 21 100 -L aquaria. Experimental fishes were exposed to hormone for 24 hours before 10 L of water was added and the first water change (approximately 80 %) was done on day 5. Fish were reared until they reached the size that histological examinations of gonad can be performed (4 months). At 120 days of age, gonads were dissected for microscopic observation. Deviations of male ratios of hormone-treated fish from control were analyzed by Chi-square test. The populations of fish which the average of 62. 88, 65. 48 and 62. 37 % males in 125, 250 and 500 μgL - 1 MT-treated groups, and 67. 90, 84. 94 and 75. 12 % males in 125, 250 and 500 μgL - 1 mesterolone-treated groups, respectively were obtained. Control fish had an average male ratio of 58 %, and this percentage was used as an expected ratio for Chi-square test. Immersion in MT at 250 μgL - 1 resulted in significantly skewed sex ratio towards male (P < 0. 05). Male ratios of fish obtained from <b>mesterolone</b> immersions at all concentrations were also significantly different from a male ratio of the control treatment (P < 0. 01). Of the concentrations used in the present study, we were unable to produce all-male progeny.

40|$|Background: Treatment with buceng {{combination}} of Eurycoma longifolia Jack and Pimpinella alpine Molk {{has been proven}} to increase testosterone level, decrease apoptosis and caspase 3 expression. Bcl 2 is an antiapoptotic protein found in cytoplasm which inhibits cells apoptosis. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of buceng on Bcl 2 expression on penile and prostate tissues of the rats. Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male Sprague Dawley rats of 90 days old, weighing ± 300 grams, were randomly assigned into four groups. Group A, normal rats. Group B, castrated rats and treated with buceng 100 mg/day, per oral (Cast-Bcg); Group C, castrated rats and treated with 2 ml of water as placebo against buceng (Cast-Plac). Group D, castrated rats, treated with <b>mesterolone</b> 6. 75 mg/day, per oral, as exogenous testosterone (Cast-Mest). All rats were treated for 30 days.

Modulation of macrophage FcγR expression is a potential therapeutic approach to immune disorders. Glucocorticoids and progesterones decrease macrophage FcγR expression. We assessed the effect of treatment with androgens and antiandrogens on the expression of macrophage FcγRs using an experimental guinea pig model. Four androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, <b>mesterolone,</b> and danazol) and five antiandrogens (flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and finasteride) were studied. Following in vivo treatment of guinea pigs, we determined the clearance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) -sensitized erythrocytes in vivo, the binding of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by isolated splenic macrophages, and splenic macrophage FcγR cell surface expression. All of the androgens impaired the clearance of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by decreasing splenic macrophage FcγR expression. Dihydrotestosterone and <b>mesterolone</b> were more effective than testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the androgens decreased the cell surface expression of FcγR 1, 2 more than that of FcγR 2.

40|$|Resumo: As diferenças entre gêneros quanto ao perfil de lipoproteínas (LP) plasmáticas e risco de doenças ateroscleróticas são geralmente atribuídas aos efeitos protetores dos estrógenos e/ou pró-aterogênicos dos andrógenos. Neste trabalho realizamos três estudos dos efeitos de variações da concentração de testosterona sobre o metabolismo das LP e aterosclerose em camundongos que expressam a proteína de transferência de colesteril éster (CETP) com ou sem deficiência parcial do {{receptor}} de LDL. No primeiro estudo, mostramos que a deficiência de testosterona aumentou os níveis plasmáticos de LDL e de anticorpos anti-LDL oxidada e duplicou o tamanho médio da lesão aterosclerótica da raiz da aorta. A expressão da CETP neste modelo levou a um menor aumento de LDL e redução significativa do tamanho da lesão aterosclerótica. No segundo trabalho, comparamos os efeitos da suplementação com testosterona, na sua forma metabolizável ou não. Mostramos que a testosterona, seja metabolizável ou não, induziu elevações significativas de LDL e HDL. Somente a testosterona metabolizável aumentou a expressão da CETP e reduziu a de lipase hepática. No terceiro estudo, investigamos a interação entre os efeitos da testosterona não metabolizável (Mesterolona) e do exercício físico. Verificamos que o exercício físico aumentou HDL, de maneira mais potente nos animais que expressavam a CETP e nos animais que não foram tratados com Mesterolona. O exercício também reduziu a atividade da CETP, os níveis de triglicérides e ácidos graxos livres, independentemente do tratamento com Mesterolona.

In the first study, we showed that testosterone deficiency increased the levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol, and the titers of auto-antibodies anti-oxidized LDL and doubled the size of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic roots. CETP expression in this animal model led to a less pronounced elevation of LDL-cholesterol and reduced significantly the atherosclerotic lesion size. In the second study, we compared the effects of two types of testosterone supplementation, metabolizable or not. We showed that either type of testosterone induced significant elevations in LDL- and HDL- cholesterol. Howerver, only the metabolizable testosterone promoted {{an increase in the}} CETP and a reduction in the hepatic lipase expression. In the third work, we investigated the interaction between the effects of non metabolizable testosterone (<b>mesterolone)</b> and physical exercise. We observed that the physical exercise increased HDL, more potently in animals expressing CETP and without <b>mesterolone</b> treatment. Physical exercise also reduced the CETP activity, triglycerides and free fatty acids levels, independently of the <b>mesterolone</b> treatment. The treatment with <b>mesterolone</b> increased VLDL, independently of the genotype and physical active state, and reduced HDL in the exercised mic...|$|E

40|$|Background: Buceng {combination of pasak bumi (Eurycoma longifolia Jack) and purwoceng (Pimpinella alpine Molk) } {{has been}} proven to {{increase}} testosterone (Te) level and decrease apoptosis. Unfortunately, {{there is no evidence}} whether these effects are mediated by the declining of caspase 3. Objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether buceng could decrease the expression of caspase 3 of penis and prostate cells in Sprague Dawley male rats. Methods: Twenty four Sprague Dawley male rats weighing 300 g (90 days old) were randomly assigned into 4 groups of 6 male rats. Group A, rats were castrated and received buceng 50 mg. Group B, rats were not castrated, sacrifices as positive control. Group C, rats were castrated and given 2 mL aquadest as negative control. Group D, rats were castrated and got of 6. 75 mg <b>mesterolone,</b> dissolved in 2 mL water. MANOVA statistical analysis was adopted to examine the difference expression of caspase 3 in all groups. The comparison of caspase 3 expression between two groups exhibiting difference values were evaluated by Post Hoc test. Results: MANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the expression of caspase 3 of penis and prostate tissues among the four groups. Post Hoct test also indicated that expression of caspase 3 in group A (buceng) (33. 56; 35. 83) was significantly lower compared to group C (negative control) (54. 33; 60. 07) and group D (<b>mesterolone)</b> (51. 91; 56. 21), p = 0. 000, and higher compared than group B or normal rats (29. 40; 27. 72), but statistically not significant (p = 0. 826). Conclusion: The treatment of 50 mg buceng /day for 30 consecutive days could decrease caspase 3 expression in penis and prostate cells.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to shorten {{recovery}} time and improve performance, strength and endurance athletes occasionally turn to the illicit use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS). This study evaluated the effects of AAS treatment on the muscle mass and phenotypic characteristics of transgenic mice subjected to a high-intensity, aerobic training program (5 d/wk for 6 weeks). The transgenic mice (CETP(+/-) LDLr(-/+)) were engineered to exhibit a lipid profile closer to humans. Animals were divided into groups of sedentary (Sed) and/or training (Ex) mice (each treated orally with AAS or gum arabic/vehicle: Sed-C, Sed-M, ex-C, ex-M). The effects of AAS (mesterolone: M) on specific phenotypic adaptations (muscle wet weight, cross-sectional area, and fiber type composition) in three hindlimb muscles (soleus:SOL, tibialis anterior:TA and gastrocnemius:GAS) were assessed. In order to detect subtle changes in fiber type profile, {{the entire range of}} fiber types (I, IC, IIAC, IIA, IIAD, IID, IIDB, IIB) was delineated using mATPase histochemistry. Body weight gain occurred throughout the study for all groups. However, the body weight gain was significantly minimized with exercise. This effect was blunted with <b>mesterolone</b> treatment. Both AAS treatment (Sed-M) and high-intensity, aerobic training (ex-C) increased the wet weights of all three muscles and induced differential hypertrophy of pure and hybrid fibers. Combination of AAS and training (ex-M) resulted in enhanced hypertrophy. In the SOL, <b>mesterolone</b> treatment (Sed-M and ex-M) caused dramatic increases in the percentages of fiber types IC, IIAC, IIAD, IID, with concomitant decrease in IIA, but had minimal impact on fiber type percentages in the predominantly fast muscles. Overall, the AAS-induced differential adaptive changes amounted to significant fiber type transformations in the fast-to-slow direction in SOL. AAS treatment had a significant effect on muscle weights and fiber type composition in SOL, TA and GAS which was even maximized in animals subjected to metabolically high-intensity aerobic exercise...|$|E
