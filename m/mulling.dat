40|$|O gênero Phyllanthus L. é o maior e mais diverso da família Phyllanthaceae, com aproximadamente 830 espécies que se distribuem {{principal}}mente nos trópicos de todo o mundo, das quais 200 ocorrem nos neotrópicos. Na América do Sul, o Brasil é o país que congrega o maior número de espécies, cerca de 100, das quais 40 % são encontradas nos estados da Região Sudeste do país, onde localiza-se o centro de diversidade do gênero no território nacional. A grande diversidade, alta representatividade e taxonomia ainda pouco estudada do grupo, mesmo no que se refere à circunscrição de suas espécies, justificam a realização do presente estudo. Deste modo, o principal objetivo deste trabalho foi levantar e analisar aspectos morfológicos e taxonômicos das espécies do gênero Phyllanthus na Região Sudeste do Brasil, contribuindo para o conhecimento do gênero no Brasil, bem como da biodiversidade brasileira. O trabalho inclui uma chave de identificação, descrições e comentários sobre a taxonomia, distribuição geográfica e ilustrações das espécies. Na Região Sudeste do Brasil foram encontradas 37 espécies do gênero: Phyllanthus acuminatus Vahl., P. acutifolius Poir ex Spreng., P amarus Schumach., P. angustissimus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. arenicola Casar., P. augustinii Baill., P. avicularis <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. caparaoensis G.

Webster, P. subemarginatus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. tenellus Roxb., P. umbratus <b>Müll.</b> Arg. e P. urinaria L. The genus Phyllanthus L. is {{the largest}} and most diverse of the family Phyllanthaceae with about 830 species that are spread mainly throughout the tropics, of which 200 are in the neotropics. From 100 species occurring in Brazil, where the genre is richest in South America, 40 % of them occur in the southern region of the country, where is located one of the centers of diversity of the genus. The great diversity, richness and taxonomy still little studied, even regarding the circumscription of their species, justifying this study. Thus, the main aim {{of this study was to}} survey and analyze morphological and taxonomic aspects of the genus in southern Brazil, contributing to the knowledge of Phyllanthus in the country as well to the Brazilian biodiversity. This study includes an identification key, descriptions and comments on the taxonomy, geographical distribution and illustrations of the species. In southeastern Brazil were found 37 species of the genus: Phyllanthus acuminatus Vahl., P. acutifolius Poir ex Spreng., P amarus Schumach., P. angustissimus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. arenicola Casar., P. augustinii Baill., P. avicularis <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. caparaoensis G.
