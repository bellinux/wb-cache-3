She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you.

500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her.

500|$|Kiedis was lyrically {{influenced}} by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs {{written for the}} album such as [...] "By the Way," [...] "I Could Die for You," [...] "Dosed," [...] "Warm Tape" [...] and non-album tracks [...] "Someone" [...] and [...] "Body of Water" [...] all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and [...] "Don't Forget Me" [...] expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: [...] "On the day <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> died/I could not get my copper clean." [...] "Venice Queen" [...] was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach.
