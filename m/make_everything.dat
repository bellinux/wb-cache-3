5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> subordinate.|$|E

25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to doing {{things that have been}} done before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much for Just the Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of a}} small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much for Just the Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> from {{sparkling}} wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E

500|$|The senior art {{director}} for Halo 4 is Kenneth Scott; {{he described the}} visual style of Halo 4 as being more ingrained in the expanded universe fiction, and more [...] "mature" [...] than before. With the game's increased focus on the Forerunners, the artists invested heavily into {{the look and feel}} of Forerunner technology. [...] The game also features more diversity in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games. The majority of the game is lit statically using lightmaps; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full global illumination and ambient occlusion. Image-based lighting is also used to ground scenes and <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> fit together better.|$|E

[...] O'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically.

De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we knew we had to <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011.

When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai.

[...] "It's still classic me but with a different twist to it – a modern twist", she said. Jim Farber from New York Daily News noted the song's riffs, which he considered greater when they first appeared in Madonna's 1985 song [...] "Into the Groove". The song was compared to Jackson's brother Michael Jackson's [...] "Rock with You" [...] (1979), due to its disco themes.

500|$|The Viceroy of India {{had already}} warned the Emir of {{approaching}} [...] "German agents and hired assassins", and the Emir had promised he would arrest the expedition if it managed to reach Afghanistan.

Suits were tailored and horses given new saddles to <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> presentable for the meeting with the Emir. The southern route {{and the city of}} Kandahar were avoided, possibly because Afghan officials wished to prevent fomenting unrest in the Pathan region close to India. On 7 September, the group left Herat for Kabul with Afghan guides on a 24-day trip via the harsher northern route through Hazarajat, over the barren mountains of central Afghanistan. En route the expedition was careful to spend enough money and gold to ensure popularity amongst the local people. Finally, on 2 October 1915, the expedition reached Kabul. It was received with a salaam from the local Turkish community and a Guard of honour from Afghan troops in Turkish uniform. Von Hentig later described receiving cheers and a grand welcome from the inhabitants of Kabul.|$|E
