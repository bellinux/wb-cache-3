The series was created by Belgium's Belvision Studios in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg. The studio divided King Ottokar's Sceptre into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Hergé's original plot in <b>many</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>It</b> was also adapted into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. The episode was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the descent into civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was Robert who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting the claim of Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Zigeunerweisen is a {{departure}} from director Suzuki Seijun's Nikkatsu films in <b>many</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>It</b> was shot entirely on location without access to studio resources; it runs 144 minutes, {{in contrast to the}} former's 90-minute maximum; and its intellectual characters and period setting and subject matter invited a more literary audience as opposed to the younger genre fans that formed Suzuki's cult following. On the other hand, freed of studio constraints, Suzuki was able to carry his style even further in the direction his genre work had taken and abandon traditional narrative entirely in favour of random occurrences and incongruous and misleading associations. He presents, comments on and challenges the conceptions of the Taishō era, specifically the wide introduction and assimilation of Western culture into Japan and its effect on the Japanese identity.|$|E

25|$|Partisanship, {{more than}} any other factor, appears to be the divider in the {{controversy}} surrounding Garcia Moreno’s legacy. Liberal opposition did and does continue to portray him as a tyrant by emphasizing the more authoritarian policies of his regime. Under Garcia Moreno’s presidency, his beliefs and goals alone directed government policies, an easily undermined structure for a stable government, and the legislature often was reduced to a rubber stamping body. Even when confronted with evidence of the good which was done under his presidency, most opponents then and now still would likely argue that the end does not justify the means, and further point out the morally ambiguous ways in which Garcia Moreno retained control: a secret police, the installation of political puppets, etc. In more modern times, particularly in modern republics, another complaint would be voiced as well, that being the establishment of a state religion, instead championing the individual's right to religious liberty. In Garcia Moreno’s defense, as conservative supporters point out, however, there are three factors which lessen this criticism. First, Garcia Moreno, unlike many rulers throughout history, made this move not for the sake of power, but rather in order to build a new moral identity for the nation; second, he believed, based on a career of watching warfare within Ecuador, that only a shared spiritual identity of Latin American-style Catholicism could bring peace to a land ravaged by strife between Liberals and Conservatives as well as former Spanish socioracial classes, and in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> worked during his regime; third, Article 10, the section of the 1869 constitution which restricted religious practice to Catholicism was, strictly speaking, a comparative continuity with the past, even though it is morally questionable, for Ecuador already was overwhelmingly Catholic {{with the exception of a}} Jewish minority and foreign Protestants living in the land. (Nevertheless, the liberal objector still could point out the ends do not justify the means and that Garcia Moreno simply could have appealed to the history of Ecuador, as separated from other former colonies in South America, for this goal.) Furthermore, the 1869 constitution also assured citizens’ right to innocence until proven guilty, prohibited arrests without warrants, and ensured the people’s rights to free speech and assembly (though one may question how well this was carried out), so long as it respected religion, morality and decency.|$|E
