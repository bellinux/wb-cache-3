40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{redesign}} {{of a previous}} pneumatic motion system for a linear scanner to meet higher performance requirements. The previous design featured a scanner head, two air bearings, and two pneumatic cylinders and was intended to propel the scanner {{head back and forth}} in a linear motion at speeds up to 5 m/s. Air was supplied to the air bearings by tethering the scanner head to an air supply with plastic tubing. At speeds nearing 5 m/s, the tether began to oscillate violently and the repeated impacts of the scanner head and pneumatic cylinders caused the entire structure to vibrate. Also, large amounts of energy were lost due to momentum transfer between the scanner head and cylinders and friction within the cylinders themselves. Further, none of the energy of the impact was recovered. These problems were corrected by designing and purchasing new equipment and slightly altering the operation of the scanner. A system of needles was designed to provide air to the air bearings without the use of a tether. New pneumatic cylinders with exceptionally low friction were purchased and a method of precharging <b>the</b> air <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rod sides of the cylinders to a certain pressure was devised to add energy back into the system that is lost during operation. A special valve was designed to accomplish the addition of air into the precharge volumes. Also, a mechanism was designed to greatly minimize the vibration of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> This structure consists of a large, suspended, inertial mass which holds the pneumatic cylinders so they are not actually <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> which holds <b>the</b> scanning track.

40|$|Process {{planning}} {{is a major}} determinant of manufacturing cost. The selection of machining parameters is an important element of process planning. The development of a utility to show the cutting power on-line would be helpful to programmers and process planners in selecting machining parameters. The relationship between the cutting power and the machining parameters is nonlinear. Presently there is no accurate or simple algorithm to calculate the required cutting power for a selected set of parameters. Although machining data handbooks, machinability data systems, and machining databases have been developed to recommend machining parameters for efficient machining, they are basically for general reference and hard to use as well;In this research, a self-organizing fuzzy-nets optimization system was developed to generate a knowledge bank that can show the required cutting power on-line for a short length of time in an NC verifier. The fuzzy-nets system (FNS) utilizes a five-step self-learning procedure. A generic FNS program consisting of fuzzification and defuzzification modules was implemented in the C++ programming language to perform the procedure. The FNS was assessed before an actual experiment was set up to collect data;The performance of the FNS was then examined for end milling operations on a Fadal VMC 40 vertical machining center.

A typical passenger seat with test dummies was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vibration <b>table.</b> All six axes of <b>the</b> vibration <b>table</b> were excited with three levels of sine sweep and random excitation signals. The responses at specific positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> test dummy were measured. The transmissibility FRF were computed with two approaches.

Both approaches delivered transmissibility FRF which were nearly identical. However, in most cases the transmissibility FRF, which were computed with the improved approach, were more noisy. The reason for this might be the spill-over effect of some cross-talk motions. An investigation of possible nonlinear effects showed that an increase of the excitation level of the sine sweep excitation resulted in a shift of the resonance peaks to lower frequencies and a reduction of the resonance amplitudes. The verification of computational models should therefore be mainly accomplished with data of the low level, if the models are assumed to be linear. Medium and high levels of sine sweep excitation should only be used for the verification of nonlinear models...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{attitude}} estimation {{is important}} for navigation, guidance and control of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) as they are mostly equipped with low integrity sensors due to <b>the</b> constraints <b>on</b> MAV payload and able power. The MAY sensors such as accelerometer and magnetometer are prone to noise as they are placed in proximity to the motor due to constraints on centre of gravity (CG). Data from a single sensor are not reliable for all operating points of flight envelope as the motor vibration and magnetic flux due to the motor vary with RPM. Hence accurate attitude estimation of MAV is achieved through multisensor data fusion. In this paper, a modification to the classical cascade Kalman filter is proposed. Modified Cascade Kalman Filter (MCKF) has better estimation performance {{as it is a}} single Kalman filter similar to measurement fusion technique and also it restores the flexibility and computational efficiency of state vector fusion method. A numerical example is presented wherein the derived MCKF is implemented for the attitude estimation of MAV in the 6 DOF simulation model developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and also for a set of calibrated accelerometer and magnetometer sensor data With motor noise acquired from <b>the</b> autopilot <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rate <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> notion simulator.

40|$|Testing of a {{particular}} nutation control system for the synchronous meteorological satellite (SMS) is described. The test method and principles are applicable to nutation angle control for other satellites with similar requirements. During its ascent to synchronous orbit, a spacecraft like the SMS spins about its minimum-moment-of-inertia axis. An uncontrolled spacecraft in this state is unstable because torques due to fuel motion increase the nutation angle. However, the SMS is equipped with an automatic nutation control (ANC) system which will keep the nutation angle close to zero. Because correct operation of this system is critical to mission success, it was tested <b>on</b> an air-bearing <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> ANC system was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three-axis air-bearing <b>table</b> which was scaled to the SMS and equipped with appropriate sensors and thrusters. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> was spun up in an altitude chamber and nutation induced so that table motion simulated spacecraft motion. The ANC system was used to reduce the nutation angle. This dynamic test of the ANC system met all its objectives and provided confidence that the ANC system will control the SMS nutation angle...|$|R
3000|$|<b>The</b> motion imposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{structure}} is harmonic in nature, with {{control over the}} frequency of the oscillations. The measured response parameters are acceleration and displacement of the structure along the line of action of the force. In case of the TLCD-Structure system, the acceleration and displacement response is measured by attaching accelerometers and LVDTs at the base and top of the structure. TRIMEX Acquire data acquisition system is used to acquire and analyse the experimental data with the help of accelerometer interface unit, dynamic LVDT signal conditioner (Model: 2000 -C- 16) and Dynamic Strain Measurement system (32 channels). While in case of the LCVA-Structure system, those responses have been measured by attaching Brüel and Kjær Deltatron 4507 - 01 accelerometers (Brüel and Kjær Sound and Vibration Measurement A/S, Nærum, Denmark) at the base and top of the structure model. PULSE 3560 B computerised data acquisition and multi-analyser system are used to acquire and analyse the data obtained in the experiments. In each set of the experiments, the Damper-Structure system is subjected to harmonic sinusoidal base motions. This external motion imposed to the structure by means of an induction motor <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shake <b>table.</b> To maintain this external excitation amplitude constant, the displacement of <b>the</b> shake <b>table</b> has been kept constant. The direction of the imposed force (or acceleration) is the plane parallel to the direction of the horizontal tube of the LCVA and TLCD damping device. The damping devices are connected rigidly with the structure by means of clamps fitted with screws {{at the top of the}} structure and the dampers are installed at the Centre of Gravity point of the plan of the structure [...]...|$|R
