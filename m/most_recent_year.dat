5|$|In 2014, the <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>year</b> {{for which}} {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, {{the first full}} year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much cheaper than the $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may {{be a factor in}} the increased ridership.|$|E
5|$|The reverse design had in 1895 been {{modified}} by Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. Following Queen Victoria's death in 1901, de Saulles was {{called upon to}} create a design for the obverse featuring Edward VII. This appeared on the penny in 1902, and remained in use until the year of King Edward's death, 1910. An obverse design by Sir Bertram Mackennal depicting George V went into use in 1911, and remained with some modification until {{the year of the}} King's death, 1936. No pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, as there were a sufficient number in circulation. At least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; they are valuable today. Edward VIII's short reign is only represented by a single pattern coin, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design depicting George VI by Humphrey Paget went into use. During the Second World War period of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck only for the colonies; these are all dated 1940, the <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>year</b> of production for the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for the penny began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.|$|E

On shoots having symptoms only on the <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>year’s</b> growth, S. conigenus was detected more frequently than D. pinea. On shoots having symptoms on both the <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> and the previous year’s growth, however, D. pinea was detected more frequently than S. conigenus on the <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>year’s</b> growth.

Whether only one pathogen was detected or the two pathogens were detected co-occurring on a single year’s growth also varied with shoot condition and shoot year of growth, but the two fungi co-occurred on shoots of each condition.
