2500|$|These {{collectors}} {{could be}} used to produce approximately 50% and more of the hot water needed for residential and commercial use in the United States. In the United States, a typical system costs $4000–$6000 retail ($1400 to $2200 wholesale for the materials) and 30% of the system qualifies for a federal tax credit + additional state credit exists in about half of the states. [...] Labor for a simple open loop system in southern climates can take 3–5 hours for the installation and 4–6 hours in Northern areas. [...] Northern system require more collector area and more complex plumbing to protect the collector from freezing. [...] With this incentive, the payback time for a typical household is four to nine years, depending on the state. [...] Similar subsidies exist in parts of Europe. A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day. [...] Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a households' operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO2 emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity). Medium-temperature installations can use any of several designs: common designs are pressurized glycol, drain back, batch systems and newer low pressure freeze tolerant systems using polymer pipes containing water with photovoltaic pumping. European and International standards are being reviewed to accommodate innovations in design and operation of <b>medium</b> <b>temperature</b> collectors. Operational innovations include [...] "permanently wetted collector" [...] operation. This innovation reduces or even eliminates the occurrence of no-flow high temperature stresses called stagnation which would otherwise reduce the life expectancy of collectors.|$|E

30|$|At lower (350  °C) {{and higher}} (450  °C) temperatures, {{methanol}} conversion and general yield of light olefins decrease faster than at <b>medium</b> <b>temperatures,</b> showing that catalyst deactivates faster at lower and higher temperatures. The yield of DME increases with decreasing yield of light olefins. It {{can be explained}} with two conclusions for this study. First, secondary reactions (hydrogen transfer, alkylation and others), which take place at higher temperatures, lead to coke formation resulting in deactivation of catalyst. With blocking of small pores inside the catalyst, DME formation occurs over external surface of SAPO- 34 on the weak acidic sites. Second, lower temperature {{is not enough for}} cracking of bulky oligomers and they are remaining in inside channels of catalyst, causing deactivation. Therefore, the conversion reaction of methanol to DME takes place at the external surface of catalyst. Also, it was observed that at higher temperature (450  °C) yield of ethylene decreases, which is explained with cracking of propylene and butenes at this temperature. Oligomerization and cracking reactions in some ways are balanced at <b>medium</b> <b>temperatures</b> and are not enough to generate too much coke [12, 21]. Because of this reason catalyst deactivates slowly. <b>Medium</b> <b>temperatures</b> are working temperatures. From Figs.  5 and 6 it is clear that synthesized SAPO- 34 -U 40 is more active and stable at 375  °C temperature. The yield of olefins reach approximately 97  wt% (31.4  wt% C 2 =, 49.4  wt% C 3 = and 16.1  wt% sumC 4 =) at 3.6  h reaction time. For our MTO tests over SAPO- 34 -U 40 catalyst, which were conducted at several temperatures, 375  °C was found to be an optimal temperature.|$|R
