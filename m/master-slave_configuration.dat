40|$|Abstract – Teleoperation system {{performances}} {{suffer from}} the delays in the communications line. These delays are usually variable time delays. The customary wave variable technique used for constant time delays cannot provide satisfactory results to stabilize the system under variable delays. Another problem occurs in the position tracking performance of the limited-workspace teleoperation systems. Although wave variable technique is proven to track position demands successfully under constant time delays given {{that there is no}} communication failure, position tracking performance also degrades under variable delays. In this paper, two components are presented to be used with the customary wave variable technique to stabilize the system and enhance the position tracking performance under variable time delays. The proposed controller is then applied to an identical <b>master-slave</b> teleoperation <b>configuration</b> which qualifies as a limited-workspace teleoperation system. I...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [79]- 80) Compressing a {{still picture}} {{consistent with the}} DCT based JPEG digital image compression standard consumes {{a large amount of}} processing time. When arithmetic coding is incorporated to increase the compression, the processing time also increases considerably. The extended JPEG image compression algorithm’s execution time is critical in several real time digital image processing applications such as video coding, video telephony, etc. DSP processor based software and hardware solutions, for the efficient and fast implementation of the extended JPEG image compression algorithm, are provided in this thesis. The primary objective of this thesis is to reduce the extended JPEG image compression algorithm’s execution time. This is achieved by using a fast 2 -D DCT algorithm and the DSP 96002 ’s inherent parallel processing capabilities. The complications involved with the fast 2 -D DCT data access and zigzag ordering is simplified by efficiently using the DSP 96002 ’s addressing capabilities. The software solution is built from two modules, one that performs the 2 -D DCT and one that performs arithmetic coding. The software solution’s accuracy and correctness is tested using five standard test images. It takes approximately 0. 55 seconds to compress/decompress a 256 x 256 pixel monochrome still picture. The average signal to noise ratio obtained for the five test images is 33 dB. The modular software design approach lends itself for execution on a multiple- instruction multiple-data (MIMD) structure. A two- and three-processor parallel pipelined architecture is proposed. A novel data transfer scheme is introduced in the three-processor structure which reduces processor idleness. Both proposed structures utilize <b>master-slave</b> <b>configurations.</b> The master executes the arithmetic coding while the slave computes the DCT. Finally, a common bus multiple-DSP system is discussed. The DSP modules tied to the system bus implement the algorithm in parallel. The extended JPEG image compression algorithm’s execution time on this multiprocessor system is dependent upon the number of modules tied to the bus and the internal module architecture. A simple and static load distribution method to increase the module utilization is presented for this structure. Excellent speedup factors were obtained when the image compression algorithm was implemented on these architectures. The speedup factors varied from 1. 45 to 5. 11 when the number of processors ranged from two to six.

40|$|The major {{challenges}} faced by the gas turbine industry, for both the users and the manufacturers, is the reduction in life cycle costs, {{as well as the}} safe and efficient running of gas turbines. In view of the above, it would be advantageous to have a diagnostics system capable of reliably detecting component faults (even though limited to gas path components) in a quantitative marmer. V This thesis presents the development an integrated fault diagnostics model for identifying shifts in component performance and sensor faults using advanced concepts in genetic algorithm. The diagnostics model operates in three distinct stages. The rst stage uses response surfaces for computing objective functions to increase the exploration potential of the search space while easing the computational burden. The second stage uses the heuristics modification of genetics algorithm parameters through a <b>master-slave</b> type <b>configuration.</b> The third stage uses the elitist model concept in genetic algorithm to preserve the accuracy of the solution in the face of randomness.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an altimetric method {{based on data}} recorded during experimental zeppelin flights over Lake Constance. Interferometric observations for this method are obtained using a <b>Master-Slave</b> receiver <b>configuration.</b> These observations contain the relative phasing of direct and reflected signals and are used for altimetry. Separated antennas {{are attached to the}} receiver to record direct and reflected signals at slant elevation angles. Filtering is required to remove direct contributions in this slant geometry. Filtered observations are corrected using an altimetric model, and thus Doppler residuals are retrieved. This correction reduces the width of the spectral reflection peak from 3 mHz to less than 10 mHz. Doppler residuals are sensitive to surface height. Lake level is estimated inversely for the residuals at different trial heights. A case study of reflection events is presented. Lake level is estimated using data from antennas with right-handed and left-handed circular polarization. Reference level is determined from tide gauge data for stations around the lake. Mean deviation of estimates from reference level is 50 cm. Doppler shifts of different model corrections are compared. The altimetric correction is the most important, with mean Doppler shifts between 316 and 560 mHz. Mean Doppler shifts are much smaller for baseline correction (less than 0. 2 mHz) and water-vapor correction (0. 1 – 1. 0 mHz). In addition, the geoid undulation effect (up to 25 cm amplitude) is predicted with mean Doppler shifts between 0. 1 and 0. 9 mHz. Precision of Doppler residuals (0. 5 – 0. 6 mHz) is insufficient to resolve the geoid undulation effect. The resolution from phase residuals is better. The effect of geoid undulation, however, is not dominant in phase residuals...|$|R
40|$|Different {{measures}} of directional influence have been employed to infer effective connectivity in the brain. When the connectivity between two regions {{is such that}} one of them (the sender) strongly influences the other (the receiver), a positive phase lag is often expected. The assumption is that the time difference implicit in the relative phase reflects the transmission time of neuronal activity. However, Brovelli et al. (2004) observed that, in monkeys engaged in processing a cognitive task, a dominant directional influence from one area of sensorimotor cortex to another may be accompanied by either a negative or a positive time delay. Here we present a model of two brain regions, coupled with a well-defined directional influence, that displays similar features to those observed in the experimental data. This model is inspired by the theoretical framework of Anticipated Synchronization developed in the field of dynamical systems. Anticipated Synchronization is a form of synchronization that occurs when a unidirectional influence is transmitted from a sender to a receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. This counterintuitive synchronization regime can be a stable solution of two dynamical systems coupled in a <b>master-slave</b> (sender-receiver) <b>configuration</b> when the slave receives a negative delayed self-feedback. Despite efforts to understand the dynamics of Anticipated Synchronization, experimental evidence for it in the brain has been lacking. By reproducing experimental delay times and coherence spectra, our results provide a theoretical basis for the underlying mechanisms of the observed dynamics, and suggest that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of Anticipated Synchronization as part of normal neurocognitive function. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The following changes were made: Agents/Sources In Lagotto 5. 0 the functionality of sources is broken into two different models: 	agents collect information from external APIs 	sources provide this information via the Lagotto API One consequence of this split of functionality is that agents can now be external to the Lagotto application. Another consequence is that agents {{no longer need to}} do API calls for every single work, but can import data in bulk. This dramatically improves performance. Deposits The new deposits API provides a common way to import data into Lagotto from external APIs. Import of data via rake task, as in previous Lagotto versions, is no longer supported in Lagotto 5. 0. The deposits API is also used by the built-in Lagotto agents.
