5|$|Lawn Tennis Championship – A {{fair number}} of spectators {{assembled}} yesterday, notwithstanding the rain, on the beautifully kept ground of the All England Club, Wimbledon, to witness the final contest between Messrs. Spencer Gore and W. Marshall for the championship. The play on both sides was {{of the highest order}} and its exhibition afforded a great treat to lovers of the game. All three sets were won buy <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore,</b> who, therefore, becomes lawn tennis champion for 1877, and wins the £12 12s. gold prize and holds the silver challenge cup, value £25 5s. The second and third prizes were then played for by Messrs. W. Marshall and G.C. Heathcote (best of three sets by agreement). Mr. Marshall won two sets to love, and therefore takes the silver prize (value £12 12s.). Mr. Heathcote takes the third prize, value £3 3s.|$|E
500|$|Barr {{was invited}} by former Vice President Al Gore {{to attend a}} We Campaign event to raise {{awareness}} for global warming. He met with Gore privately before attending the July 17 event. Barr remarked that [...] "global warming is a reality", and affirmed his belief {{that the government should}} [...] "remain firmly committed to free market solutions and innovations to address this issue; not tax-driven policies." [...] He praised Gore for his efforts and said he was [...] "pleased that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> agrees that the public debate of this issue should include me." [...] He criticized fellow candidates John McCain and Barack Obama for not attending the event and said that their absence showed [...] "their unwillingness to address this important issue." [...] He called on his fellow candidates to appear at other We Campaign events to debate solutions to the problem of climate change.|$|E
500|$|After announcing {{he would}} not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore {{endorsed}} Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: [...] "I actually do think the endorsement of Al Gore began the decline." [...] The Times further noted that [...] "Dean instantly amplified his statement {{to indicate that the}} endorsement from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore,</b> a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it." [...] Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, [...] "alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country", indicating that if something did not change, Dean would be the nominee. Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr. Gore's office, who was bringing a letter to Mr. Tulliver. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> had been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see Mr. Tulliver, according to appointment, but would be at his office at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some important information by letter.|$|E

She was painfully turning her second set of rhymes, and really believed that she had been subjected to a hardship. In {{the meantime}} Olivia and Mr. Glascock were discussing her at a distance.|$|E
6000|$|... 17. To-day I went to Lewis at the Secretary's office; where I saw {{and spoke}} to Mr. Harley, who promised, in a few days, to finish {{the rest of my}} business.

I dined to-day with one <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore,</b> elder brother to a young merchant of my acquaintance; and Stratford and my other friend merchants dined with us, where I stayed late, drinking claret and burgundy; and am just got to bed, and will say no more, but that it now begins to be time to have a letter from my own little MD; for the last I had above a fortnight ago, and the date was old too.|$|E

"When Master Adams {{came into}} the meeting-house {{at the head of}} the committee," [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> said to the boys, in {{continuing}} his story, [...] "he whispered to those who were nearest as he passed, and I was one of them, 'Both regiments or none! Both regiments or none!' I did not at the moment understand his meaning; but a few moments later, when the report had been read, all was clear. Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson had decided that both regiments could not be removed; one must remain. The Twenty-ninth, because it was members of that body who committed the murder, was to be sent to the Castle; but the Fourteenth, so the Lieutenant-Governor declared, was to remain in the city. Then we knew what Master Adams meant by his whispered communication, and the cry went up in such volume as seemed to shake the building, 'Both regiments or none.' ...|$|E

6000|$|That {{might have}} cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, {{if there had}} not come {{at the same time}} the much-dreaded blow of finding that his father must be a bankrupt, after all; at least, the {{creditors}} must be asked to take less than their due, which to Tom's untechnical mind was the same thing as bankruptcy. His father must not only be said to have [...] "lost his property," [...] but to have [...] "failed,"--the word that carried the worst obloquy to Tom's mind. For when the defendant's claim for costs had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore,</b> and the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; [...] "not more than ten or twelve shillings in the pound," [...] predicted Mr. Deane, in a decided tone, tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like a scalding liquied, leaving a continual smart.|$|E
60|$|The clerk, {{struck with}} Mr. Tulliver's glistening, excited glance, looked after {{him for a}} few moments, and then rode away. The reading of a letter was not the affair of an instant to Mr. Tulliver; he took {{in the sense of a}} {{statement}} very slowly through the medium of written or even printed characters; so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he would open it in his armchair at home. But by-and-by it occurred to him that there might be something in the letter Mrs. Tulliver must not know about, and if so, it would be better to keep it out of her sight altogether. He stopped his horse, took out the letter, and read it. It was only a short letter; the substance was, that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> had ascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that Furley had been lately much straitened for money, and had parted with his securities,--among the rest, the mortgage on Mr. Tulliver's property, which he had transferred to----Wakem.|$|E
6000|$|After {{the ladies}} went there was rather a bad half hour for Mr. Glascock. He was button-holed by the minister, {{and found it}} oppressive before he was enabled to escape into the drawing-room. [...] "Mr. Glascock," [...] said the minister, [...] "an English gentleman, sir, like you, who has the {{privilege}} of an hereditary seat in your parliament,"--Mr. Glascock was not quite sure whether he were being accused of having an hereditary seat in the House of Commons, {{but he would not}} stop to correct any possible error on that point,--"and who has been born to all the gifts of fortune, rank, and social eminence, should never think that his education is complete till he has visited our great cities in the west." [...] Mr. Glascock hinted that he by no means conceived his education to be complete; but the minister went on without attending to this. [...] "Till you have seen, sir, what men can do who are placed upon the earth with all God's gifts of free intelligence, free air, and a free soil, but without any of those other good things which we are accustomed to call the gifts of fortune, you can never become aware of the infinite ingenuity of man." [...] There had been much said before, but just at this moment <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> and the American left the room, and the Italian followed them briskly. Mr. Glascock at once made a decided attempt to bolt; but the minister was on the alert, and was too quick for him. And he was by no means ashamed of what he was doing. He had got his guest by the coat, and openly declared his intention of holding him. [...] "Let me keep you for a few minutes, sir," [...] said he, [...] "while I dilate on this point in one direction. In the drawing-room female spells are too potent for us male orators. In going among us, Mr. Glascock, you must not look for luxury or refinement, for you will find them not. Nor must you hope to encounter the highest order of erudition. The lofty summits of acquired knowledge tower in your country with an altitude we have not reached yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a clear}} frosty January day {{on which}} Mr. Tulliver first came downstairs. The bright sun on the {{chestnut}} boughs and the roofs opposite his window had made him impatiently declare {{that he would be}} caged up no longer; he thought everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine than his bedroom; for he knew nothing of the bareness below, which made the flood of sunshine importunate, as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks where well-known objects once had been. The impression on his mind that it was but yesterday when he received the letter from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore</b> was so continually implied in his talk, and the attempts to convey to him the idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr. Turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge. The full sense of the present could only be imparted gradually by new experience,--not by mere words, which must remain weaker than the impressions left by the old experience. This resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and children. Mrs. Tulliver said Tom must not go to St. Ogg's at the usual hour, he must wait and see his father downstairs; and Tom complied, though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the last few days. For Guest & Co. had not bought the mill; both mill and land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises, and had laid before Mr. Deane and Mr. Glegg, in Mrs. Tulliver's presence, his willingness to employ Mr. Tulliver, in case of his recovery, as a manager of the business. This proposition had occasioned much family debating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such an offer ought not to be rejected when {{there was nothing in the}} way but a feeling in Mr. Tulliver's mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles shared it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish,--indeed, as a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr. Tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his general quarrelsomeness, and his special exhibition of it in going to law. Here was an opportunity for Mr. Tulliver to provide for his wife and daughter without any assistance from his wife's relations, and without that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the wayside. Mr. Tulliver, Mrs. Glegg considered, must be made to feel, when he came to his right mind, that he could never humble himself enough; for that had come which she had always foreseen would come of his insolence in time past [...] "to them as were the best friends he'd got to look to." [...] Mr Glegg and Mr. Deane were less stern in their views, but they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his hot-tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a right feeling about the matter,--he had no grudge against Tulliver.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Tulliver first {{knew the}} fact that the law-suit was decided against him, and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who {{happened}} to observe him at the time thought that, for so confident and hot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well. He thought so himself; he {{thought he was going to}} show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed, they would find themselves mistaken. He could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them. There was such a rush of projects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gore,</b> and mounted his horse to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held the mortgage on the land,--a reasonable fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr. Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr. Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made over to him, Mr. Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment? Certainly not Furley, for Mr. Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other men's actions. There was no doubt (in the miller's mind) that Furley would do just what was desirable; and if he did--why, things would not be so very much worse. Mr. Tulliver and his family must live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid off Furley's advances, and that might be while Mr. Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him. It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly an awkward moment in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor Riley, who had died suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,--a fact which had helped to make Mr. Tulliver's banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas. Well! he had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really vexatious business was {{the fact that}} some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to repay Mrs. Glegg had become uneasy about his money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr. Tulliver, still confident that he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects, as security in lieu of the bond. It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off the money, and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another. But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife's friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy's furniture be sold, and it might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money,--there would, after all, be no gift or favor in the matter. Mr. Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but Bessy might do so if she liked.|$|E
