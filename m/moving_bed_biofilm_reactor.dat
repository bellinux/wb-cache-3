Most of Italian plants are small, but they altogether treat {{only a little}} fraction of total pollutant load and must comply with different local regulations.

40|$|International audienceTwo trains (A and B) of four-stage <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBRs) were {{developed}} for the degradation of thiocyanate (SCN(-)), cyanate (OCN(-)) and ammonia (NH 3). A pre-denitrification configuration {{was established in the}} first-stage reactor of the B train using SCN(-) and OCN(-) as the sole carbon source. SCN(-), OCN(-) and NH 3 were completely removed in both trains. The highest removal of total nitrogen equivalent (total-N) occurred at a loading rate of 5. 6 mg-N L(- 1) h(- 1). The pre-denitrification configuration resulted in increased total-N removal in the B train (62. 6 %) compared to the A train (38. 5 %). Thiobacillus spp. were the predominant bacteria in all MBBRs. Bacteria related to bioprocesses involving anaerobic ammonium oxidation were present in the B train, suggesting that part of nitrogen removal occurs via this pathway. Our results showed that the pre-denitrification configuration increases the efficiency of removal of total-N compounds in the SCN(-) /OCN(-) -degrading MBBR process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} packing rates (20 %, 30 %, and 40 %) of {{polyurethane}} foam (PUF) to {{the removal of}} organics and nitrogen were investigated by continuously feeding artificial sewage in three aerobic <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} packing rate of the PUF carriers had little influence on the COD removal efficiency (81 % on average). However, ammonium removal was affected by the packing rates, which was presumably due to the different relative abundances of nitrifying bacteria. A high ammonium removal efficiency of 96. 3 % at a hydraulic retention time of 5 h was achieved in 40 % packing rate reactor, compared with 37. 4 % in 20 % packing rate. Microprofiles of dissolved oxygen and nitrate revealed that dense biofilm limits the DO transfer distance and nitrate diffusion. Pyrosequencing analysis of the biofilm showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were the three most abundant phyla, but the proportions of the microbial community varied with the packing rate of the PUF carriers.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of biofilm {{thickness}} on the nitrifying activity in <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBRs) in a controlled environment. In-depth understanding of biofilm properties in MBBRs and their effect on the overall treatment efficiency compose the key to optimizing process stability and efficiency. However, evaluating biofilm properties in continuously operated MBBRs can be extremely challenging. This study uses a carrier design which enables comparison of four different biofilm thicknesses, in otherwise equally operated lab-scale MBBRs. The results show that, within the studied range (200 - 500 µm) and specific operation conditions, biofilm thickness alone had no {{significant effect on the}} overall ammonium removal. The nitrate production, however, decreased with a decreasing biofilm thickness, and the ratio between nitrite and ammonia oxidizing activity decreased both with increasing load and decreasing oxygen concentration for all thicknesses. The suggestion that nitratation is disfavored in thin biofilms is an interesting contribution to current research being performed on NOB inhibition for deammonification applications. By indicating that different groups of bacteria respond differently to biofilm thickness, this study accentuates the importance of further evaluation of these complex systems...|$|R

40|$|Implementation {{of partial}} {{nitritation}} anammox (PNA) {{in the mainstream}} (municipal wastewater treatment) is still under investigation. Microbial community structure and reactor type can influence the performance of PNA reactor; yet, {{little is known about}} the role of the community composition of the inoculum and the reactor configuration under mainstream conditions. Therefore, this study investigated the community structure of inocula of different origin and their consecutive community dynamics in four different lab-scale PNA reactors with 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. These reactors were operated for almost 1 year and subjected to realistic seasonal temperature fluctuations as in moderate climate regions, that is, from 20 °C in summer to 10 °C in winter. The sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial community in the reactors comprised: (1) a nitrifying community (consisting of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB)); (2) different heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and other putative heterotrophic bacteria (HB). The nitrifying community was the same in all four reactors at the genus level, although the biomasses were of different origin. Community dynamics revealed a stable community in the <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBR) in contrast to the sequencing batch reactors (SBR) at the genus level. Moreover, the reactor design seemed to influence the community dynamics, and reactor operation significantly influenced the overall community composition.

40|$|ABSTRACT A new {{advanced}} biological reactor called <b>Moving</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> (MBBR) for {{wastewater treatment}} is discussed. General description of expected setup of reactor is given. The <b>Moving</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> (MBBR) technology is an attached growth biological treatment process {{based on a}} continuously operating, non-clogging biofilm reactor with low head loss, a high specific Biofilm surface area, and no requirement for backwashing. MBBR is often designed as aerobic system. Moving Bed technology presents several operational advantages, compared to other conventional biological treatments. Different applications of this technology for small plants are studied, considering main investment and operating costs. Processes will take account of Moving Bed Biological Reactors (MBBR) {{with some sort of}} modifications. Conditions studied include COD removal, or COD and nutrients removal, with different primary treatments. Smaller biological reactor volumes and smaller secondary settling surface are needed. The results can indicate that MBBR with polyethylene media as Biofilm carrier may possess great potential to be used for OMs removal from water and wastewater. This study can be helpful to check possibility that the moving bed Biofilm process may be used as an ideal and efficient option for the total nutrient removal from municipal wastewater...|$|E

40|$|Three <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> {{were used}} to treat {{synthesized}} wastewater of aromatic amine compounds including aniline, para-diaminobenzene and para-aminophenol that are found in many industrial wastewaters. The reactors with cylindrical shape had an internal diameter and an effective depth of 10 and 60 cm, respectively. The reactors were filled with light expanded clay aggregate as carriers and operated in an aerobic batch and continuous conditions. Evaluation of the reactors' efficiency was done at different retention time of 8, 24, 48 and 72 h with an influent COD from 100 to 3500 mg/L (filling ratio of 50 %). The maximum obtained removal efficiencies were 90 % (influent COD= 2000 mg/L), 87 % (influent COD= 1000 mg/L) and 75 % (influent COD= 750 mg/L) for aniline, para-diaminobenzene and para-aminophenol, respectively. In the study of decrease in filling ratio from 50 to 30 percent, 6 % decrease for both para-diaminobenzene and para-aminophenol and 7 % increase for aniline degradation were obtained. The removal efficiency was decreased to about 10 % after 15 days of continuous loading {{for each of the}} above three substrates. In the shock loading test, initially the COD removal rate was decreased in all reactors, but after about 10 days, it has been approached to the previous values.

For {{the accumulation of}} nitrite, {{it is crucial to}} inhibit nitriteoxidizing bacteria (NOB) with simultaneous proliferation of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The present study describes the effect of the influent total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) concentration on AOB and NOB activity in two <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> operated as sequencing batch reactors (SBR) at 15 °C (SBR I) and 21 °C (SBR II). The reactors were fed with diluted reject water containing 600, 300, 150 and 75 mg TAN L- 1. The only factor limiting NOB activity in these reactors was the high concentrations of free ammonia and/or free nitrous acid (FNA) during the SBR cycles. Nitrite accumulation was observed with influents containing 600, 300 and 150 mg TAN L- 1 in SBR I and 600 and 300 in SBR II. Once nitrate production established in the reactors, the increase of influent TAN concentration up to the original 600 mg TAN L- 1 did not limit NOB activity. This was due to the massive development of NOB clusters throughout the biofilm that were able to cope with faster formation of FNA.

40|$|Problem statement: Nitrification by <b>Moving</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> (MBBR) {{involves}} physical, {{chemical and}} biological processes to remove toxic ammonia for aquaculture that are governed {{by a variety of}} parameters, like substrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations, organic matters, temperature, pH, alkalinity and turbulence level, which impact negatively or positively on nitrification kinetics. Approach: The situation becomes more serious as the reaction rate is inhibited by low ammonium concentration and high salinity. That problems usually occur in treatment systems of aquatic breeding hatcheries. Results: In this study, experiments have been conducted to evaluate the impact of salinity on nitrification rate through kinetic constant (k) and reaction order (n) based on general equation v = kC n. <b>Moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> was operated continuously at same initial amounts of nitrogen and Phosphorus very low (oligotrophic conditions).

40|$|Phosphorus (P) and {{nitrogen}} (N) removal from municipal wastewater is performed {{to prevent or}} reduce eutrophication in the receiving water. Both P and N can be removed physical/chemically as well as biologically. While biological processes have always dominated in N-removal, chemical P-removal is used in many cases. Biological P-removal using {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) is normally carried out in suspended culture (activated sludge) processes while biological N-removal (through nitrification and denitrification) can be done in biofilm processes as well. There are, however, potential advantages related to sludge separation and required reactor volumes, which suggest that a pure biofilm process can be an interesting alternative to activated sludge for biological phosphorus {{and nitrogen}} removal. The scope {{of this study was to}} investigate use of the <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR) process for biological phosphorus removal. The goal has been to describe the operating conditions required for biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal in a MBBR operated as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and determine dimensioning criteria for such a process.

The results showed that biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal can be achieved in a <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> operated as a SBR. The required operating conditions will be dependant on the wastewater quality.

40|$|Partial {{nitrification}} {{was reported}} to be technically feasible and economically favorable, especially for wastewater with high ammonium concentration or low C/N ratio. In this study, the effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) and influent ratio of chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen (COD/N) ratio on biological nitrogen removal from synthetic wastewater was investigated. Experiments were conducted in <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBRs) on partial nitrification process in pilot-plant configuration for 300 days. DO levels were changed from 0. 04 to 0. 12 and 0. 42 to 3. 4 mg/l in the anoxic (R 1) and aerobic (R 2) reactors, respectively. The optimum DO for partial nitrification was between 1 - 1. 5 mg/l in the aerobic reactor (R 2). Influent COD/N ratios between 20 and 2 g COD/g-N were tested by changing the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) supplied to the pilot plant. During operational conditions when the DO concentration in aerobic reactor was above 1 mg/l, near complete organic carbon removal occurred in the total MBBRs system. The effluent total nitrogen concentration in the operational conditions (1. 7 - 2. 1 mg O 2 /l and NH+ 4 -N= 35. 7 mg N/l) was obtained in the range of 0. 85 - 2 mg/l. The highest nitrite accumulation (50 %- 52 %) took place at the DO concentration of 1 - 1. 5 mg/l and increased with decreasing COD/N ratio in aerobic reactor (R 2). This study showed that the average nitrification rate at various COD/N ratios is about 0. 96 gN/m 2 per day while the maximum nitrification rate is about 2 gN/m 2 per day at COD/N ratios lower than 6. The experimental COD/N ratio for denitrification was close to complete sum of NO 2 - and NO 3 - (NOx) removal efficiency (about 99 %) at COD/N ratio equal 14 in the operational conditions in the anoxic reactor (R 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Excess of {{nitrogen}} in water bodies causes eutrophication. One important source {{of nitrogen}} is the effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Nitrogen in wastewater is most commonly removed by nitrification-denitrification. During nitrification-denitrification, aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) oxidize ammonium to nitrite, which is in turn oxidized to nitrate by their syntrophic partners; aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria. Heterotrophic denitrifiers can then convert the nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. Partial-nitritation anammox (PNA) is an alternative process for nitrogen removal which is today used for treatment of warm and concentrated sidestreams (reject water after anaerobic sludge digestion) at WWTPs, with potential to be used also for the mainstream of wastewater. PNA relies on bacteria capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) using nitrite as electron acceptor. Together with AOB they convert ammonia to nitrogen gas. To increase retention of biomass in bioreactors, bacteria are often grown in biofilms, microbial communities attached to a surface. The overall aim of this thesis was to study nitrifying- and anammox communities in <b>biofilms,</b> using <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> as a model system. Reactor performance, microbial community dynamics and biofilm structure of PNA reactors operated a low temperature or low ammonium concentration were studied, showing community stability, but process instabilities. Differences in composition and ribosomal content between reject- and mainstream communities were investigated, showing that both abundance and bacterial activity are important for explaining differences in process rates. Basic question about biofilm ecology were also studied. Here, for the first time, predation of anammox bacteria in biofilms was demonstrated. Furthermore, it was shown how biofilm thickness influences nitrifying communities and biofilm functions, with differences in community composition and ecosystem function. Together these results help to unravel the link between community composition and bioreactor function for anammox and nitrifying biofilms, {{which can lead to}} development of new technologies and strategies for N-removal in wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{efficiency}} of conventional biological treatment, innovative solutions are being explored to improve the removal of trace organic chemicals in wastewater. Controlling biomass exposure to growth substrate represents an appealing option for process optimization, as substrate availability likely impacts microbial activity, hence organic trace chemical removal. This study investigated the elimination of pharmaceuticals in pre-denitrifying <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBRs), where <b>biofilm</b> exposure to different organic substrate loading and composition was controlled by reactor staging. A three-stage MBBR and a single-stage reference MBBR (with the same operating volume and filling ratio) were operated under continuous-flow conditions (18 months). Two sets of batch experiments (day 100 and 471) were performed to quantify and compare pharmaceutical removal and denitrification kinetics in the different MBBRs. Experimental results revealed the possible influence of retransformation (e. g., from conjugated metabolites) and enantioselectivity on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals. In {{the second set of}} experiments, specific trends in denitrification and biotransformation kinetics were observed, with highest and lowest rates/rate constants in the first (S 1) and the last (S 3) staged sub-reactors, respectively. These observations were confirmed by removal efficiency data obtained during continuous-flow operation, with limited removal (< 10 %) of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and highest removal in S 1 within the three-stage MBBR. Notably, biotransformation rate constants obtained for non-recalcitrant pharmaceuticals correlated with mean specific denitrification rates, maximum specific growth rates and observed growth yield values. Overall, these findings suggest that: (i) the long-term exposure to tiered substrate accessibility in the three-stage configuration shaped the denitrification and biotransformation capacity of biofilms, with significant reduction under substrate limitation; (ii) biotransformation of pharmaceuticals may have occurred as a result of cometabolism by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{challenge}} to apply anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) for nitrogen removal from wastewater at low temperatures.

40|$|True {{biological}} aerated filters (BAFs) combine two unit {{operations in}} one reactor: {{aerobic biological treatment}} and subsequent biomass separation from the effluent (Stephenson et al., 1993). The submerged media used as support for the microbial biofilms are usually granular in nature and are therefore able to also act as depth filtration media. Therefore BAFs should provide a small footprint alternative to traditional aerobic processes. Indeed, Dillon and Thomas (1990) noted that a "good quality effluent" was possible up to a loading of 4. 1 kgBOD/m 3 /d (9. 1 kgCOD/m 3 /d); with an automated backwash programme influent BOD 5 was reduced by between 90. 3 % and 97. 6 %. Pujol et al. (1992) found an effluent standard of 90 mgCOD/I difficult to achieve for loading rates above 6. 0 kgCOD/m 3 /d. Stensel et al., 1988) achieved 88 % removal of ammonia at a loading rate of 1. 6 kgBOD/m 3 /d and modern BAFs can achieve simultaneous carbonaceous BOD and ammonia removal at loading rates of 2. 5 kgBOD/m 3 /d (Rogalla and Payraudeau, 1987). Despite the impressive loadings rates possible, BAFs require large volumes of water for backwashing {{on a regular basis}} to prevent blockage of the media. Therefore these processes require large volume tanks to hold effluent for backwashing and mudwells for collection of the backwash water. In addition, large pumps and pipework systems are needed to achieve the required backwash flowrates. In depth filters, this problem can be overcome by using continuous filtration systems, e. g. Dynasand (Kramer and Wouters, 1993). These incorporate a media recycle and wash system which allows uninterrupted treatment to occur. In Dynasand, the liquid flow is upwards and the media flow downward. The sand is removed {{from the base of the}} reactors, cleaned and then transported to the top of the bed. Thus the water exiting the filter always see a clean polishing layer of sand. The sand is removed by means of an airlift pump at the base of the reactor. Moving bed systems have been tested on sewage as an alternative to sedimentation (Mixon, 1973). It is possible that the advantages of the <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> principle could be combined with BAF technology to reduce or eliminate the need for expensive backwashing facilities. Such a system would not be the same as <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> described by Rusten (1984) and Hem et al. (1994) which require separate secondary sedimentation tanks.

40|$|Removal of {{ammonium}} by nitrification in biofilm {{systems is}} a common method in wastewater treatment. The ammonium removal efficiency in the nitrification process {{is influenced by the}} competition between nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria in the biofilm, particularly for space and oxygen. The competition is affected by the ratio of organic carbon (C) to inorganic nitrogen (N) in the wastewater, since organic carbon gives advantageous conditions for the heterotrophic bacteria that can outcompete the nitrifying bacteria in the biofilm. The aim for this master thesis was to improve the knowledge about the competition between nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in the biofilm in order to improve ammonium removal efficiency and functionality. Experiments were done in two different nitrification biofilm systems. The first nitrification system investigated was for <b>biofilm</b> carriers in <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBR) at the Department of Biotechnology. The hypothesis behind the MBBR experiments was that the biofilm with long-term exposure to organic loading (C/N ratio 1) would have reduced nitrification robustness and nitrification efficiency because of increased heterotrophic growth compared to biofilm without long-term exposure to organic loading (C/N ratio 0). Two MBBR were continuous operating for 2 separate periods of time and different short-term experiments were done to investigate the differences between the reactors. The results from the long-term continuous operations were that nitrification activity and stability, and thus nitrification efficiency, were not decreased after long-term supply of C/N ratio 1 to the biofilm. Acute organic carbon inhibition experiments showed decreased nitrification efficiency in the biofilm with long-term exposure to organic loading. Increased loading rate of organic carbon reduced the nitrification efficiency in both the reactors and denitrification was observed. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed a shift in microbial community structure after increasing the organic carbon concentrations in both reactors. The second nitrification system investigated was stationary biofilters consisting of Leca in Biological Filtration and Oxygenated Reactors (BIOFOR) at Vestfjorden Avløpselskap (VEAS) wastewater treatment plant in Asker. The hypothesis behind the study of the stationary nitrification filters consisting of Leca particles was that the automatic washing process of the biofilters removed high amounts of heterotrophic bacteria from the outer layers of the biofilm, but not high amounts of the nitrifying bacteria in the inner layers of the biofilm. The results from the batch oxygen experiments showed that oxygen consumption was 4 % higher and ammonium consumption rate was 19 % lower in unwashed biofilter compared to washed biofilter. The difference in ammonium consumption is a strong indication that the washing process remove heterotrophic bacteria. The DGGE analysis of microbial community structure showed that the difference between unwashed and washed biofilter was not statically significant...|$|R
40|$|Summary In deammonification process {{applied in}} a <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR), oxygen is an {{important}} parameter for the process performance and efficiency. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of aeration strategies on behavior of different microorganisms in deammonification process. Experiments were carried out in MBBR of 200 L volume filled with 40 % of Kaldnes biofilm carriers. Activities of different groups of bacteria were studied by Specific Anammox Activity (SAA), Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) and Nitrate Utilization Rate (NUR) tests. The results showed that activity of anammox bacteria could be enhanced by introducing non-aerated phase (intermittent aeration) and high nitrogen load. Ammonium oxidizers (AOB) activity in the biofilm was influenced by the oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid. N 2 O production was mainly due to ammonium oxidizers in aerated phase and heterotrophic denitrifiers in non-aerated phase...|$|E

The {{present study was}} performed in a turbot shallow raceway recirculating aquaculture system throughout 221 days after initial fish stocking. The dynamics of bacteria attached to a <b>Moving</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> {{and the distribution of}} the system culturable planktonic heterotrophic bacteria were assessed. Diferent levels of free heterotrophic bacteria were found over time: ≤ 2. 6 x 104 CFUmL 1 in incoming and ozonated water and 1. 5 106 CFUmL 1 in raceway and bio¢lter water. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of nine strains persistently isolated fromthe systema⁄liated with Bacteroidetes, a-Proteobacteria or g-Proteobacteria. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) data showed temporal and spatial segregation of attached biofilter community.

40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>moving</b> <b>bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> and membrane bioreactors (MBBR-MR) can {{compensate for the}} drawbacks of both of these systems and further increase their acceptance and application in wastewater treatment industries. Despite {{the potential benefits of}} a MBBR-MR technology there has only been limited study of this configuration. The present study consisted of an overall assessment of the performance of a combined MBBR-MR system under high and low loading rates. Since colloidal matter in mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) is considered as one of the important contributors to membrane fouling, pre-treatment of membrane feed by coagulation was investigated for improving membrane performance. The performance of the MBBR-MR was assessed based on its chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and membrane fouling mechanisms. The study was carried out using pilot-scale MBBR and bench-scale batch membrane filtration setups (Millipore Inc. Bedford, MA). The pilot MBBR had a working volume of 1. 8 m 3 and a 30 % carrier fill fraction. The MBBR was operated with loading rates of 160 ± 44 g/m 2 /d (hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 4. 6 h) and 223 g/m 2 /d (HRT of 2. 6 h). The MBBR feed was obtained from a starch recovery line in a potato chip processing factory. The carriers were mixed by coarse bubble aeration and the dissolved oxygen (DO) was maintained above 2 mg/l. Preliminary jar test trials (based on turbidity removal) were performed in order to obtain an optimal dosage of coagulants for subsequent ultrafiltration (UF) tests. The efficiency of three coagulants (alum, ferric chloride and a blend of polyaluminum chloride and polyamine) was evaluated. The membranes were composed of polyethersulfone (PES) and had a pore size of 0. 05 microns. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the {{combination of}} MBBR with membrane filtration can be operated at relatively high loading rates to yield a constant high quality permeate that is suitable for water reuse purposes. Fouling of the membrane by the wastewater was found to be substantially reduced by treatment with the MBBR. The reversible and irreversible fouling of the MBBR effluent were 56 and 63 %, respectively, of that observed with the raw wastewater. The MBBR Loading-rate was found to affect treatment efficiency of the MBBR-MR and membrane performance. Operation under the elevated loading-rate conditions HRT = 2. 6 hours) resulted in an increase in the irreversible fouling of the membranes (60 % on average). The addition of all the coagulants in this study was found to decrease the fouling of the membrane. However, the extent of the pre-coagulation effect on membrane fouling was found to strongly depend on the type and dosage of the coagulant and the MBBR effluent characteristics. All the coagulants were effective in decreasing membrane fouling at their optimal dosages which was determined in preliminary jar tests. Ferric chloride performed the best as a pretreatment coagulant compared to alum (Aluminum sulfate) and the coagulant blend with reductions in both reversible and irreversible fouling (43 - 86 % and 51 - 71 %, respectively) and increased consistency (in decreasing fouling) as compared to the other coagulants. Alum had no effect on irreversible fouling and the coagulant blend significantly increased irreversible fouling in some trials (up to 196 % or by a factor of 3 when overdosed). Additionally, alum and the blend were, on average, 29 % and 7 %, less effective than ferric chloride in reducing reversible fouling under the conditions and dosages tested...|$|R

During optimum conditions, close to complete nitrification with average ammonium removal efficiency of 99. 72 % occurred in the aerobic reactor. In the aerobic reactor, the average specific nitrification rate was 1. 8 g NOx-N kg VSS− 1 h− 1. The results of the average effluent soluble COD concentration from each reactor showed that denitrification process in the second anoxic reactor consumed most of the biodegradable organic matter. As seen from the results, denitrification rate has increased with increasing NOx-N loading in the second anoxic reactor. The aerobic phosphate removal rate showed a good correlation to the anaerobic phosphate release rate. Moreover, phosphate removal rate showed a strong correlation to the phosphate loading rate in the aerobic reactor.
