5|$|Destroying ivory by any {{practical}} <b>means</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Burning is {{the most}} common method of large-scale destruction of ivory. When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media spectacle and inspired similar actions around the world. More recently, crushing methods have also been used, as well as combinations of crushing and burning.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where <b>Means</b> <b>is</b> living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which <b>Means</b> <b>is</b> ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|Means (Kristen Cloke) is a {{forensic}} psychologist and {{a candidate to}} join the Millennium Group. Like Black, Means has a nearly-supernatural insight into criminal cases (which she attributes to a guardian angel). When <b>Means</b> <b>is</b> prepared for initiation into the group the angelic presence forsakes her, leading to a mental breakdown as she shelters herself from the viral outbreak orchestrated by the group. Means gives Catherine Black her vaccine dose, which she uses to inoculate her daughter Jordan.|$|E
5000|$|... {{then their}} sum is , so their {{arithmetic}} <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> and their product is , so their geometric <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> therefore, the arithmetic mean and geometric <b>mean</b> <b>are</b> equal, as desired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{harmonic}} <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the three}} Pythagorean means. For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of nonequal values, the harmonic <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always the least of the three means, while the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always the greatest of the three and the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always in between. (If all values in a nonempty dataset are equal, the three <b>means</b> <b>are</b> always equal to one another; e.g., the harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means of {2, 2, 2} are all 2.) ...|$|R

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{arrives at}} Means' home, but is confronted by other Group members and assaulted. <b>Means</b> <b>is</b> inside, {{experiencing}} a prolonged hallucination. She considers suicide, instead writing something and sealing {{it in an}} envelope. Black finds her home, accompanied by paramedics who take her away. She gives Black the envelope—containing a phial of vaccine—and he thanks her, unable to discover what happened to Watts.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook Primary {{school is}} at Albion Street and caters for {{students}} aged between 3 and 11 years. It {{is a much}} larger than average-sized school though {{the number of students}} eligible for free school <b>means</b> <b>is</b> below average. The standard of provision is declining; in 2001 the school was named by OFSTED {{as one of the most}} successful schools in England but subsequent inspections have seen the school's rating decline so that in the most recent inspection the school was rated as satisfactory overall, with inconsistent levels of attainment and teaching noted.|$|E
5000|$|These <b>means</b> <b>were</b> {{studied with}} {{proportions}} by Pythagoreans and later generations of Greek mathematicians {{because of their}} importance in geometry and music. The harmonic and arithmetic <b>means</b> <b>are</b> reciprocal duals of each other for positive arguments (...) while the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> its own reciprocal dual.|$|R
30|$|As an application, {{some new}} quasi-arithmetic <b>means</b> <b>are</b> constructed, and the {{monotonicity}} and convergence of these <b>means</b> <b>are</b> investigated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometric}} <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> {{also one}} of the three classical Pythagorean means, together with the aforementioned arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean. For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of unequal values, the harmonic <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always the least of the three means, while the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always the greatest of the three and the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always in between (see Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.) ...|$|R
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E

30|$|In {{this setting}} Kedlaya’s {{result could be}} {{expressed}} briefly as: a geometric <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> a Kedlaya <b>mean.</b> Nevertheless, there appears a natural problem—to find a broad family of Kedlaya means. For example, it is quite easy to prove that min and arithmetic <b>means</b> <b>are</b> Kedlaya <b>means.</b> Moreover, convex combinations of Kedlaya <b>means</b> <b>are</b> again Kedlaya <b>means.</b>|$|R
25|$|Let me {{assure you}} that King's work most {{definitely}} is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really <b>means</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is not}} the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.|$|E
25|$|Government {{attempts}} to obtain incriminating statement {{related to the}} offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious <b>means</b> <b>is</b> a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.|$|E
25|$|Classical deism {{held that}} a human's {{relationship}} with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through divine providence. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.|$|E

50|$|Weighted {{versions}} of other <b>means</b> can also <b>be</b> calculated. Probably {{the best known}} weighted <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the weighted arithmetic mean, usually simply called the weighted mean. Another example of a weighted <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the weighted harmonic mean.|$|R

25|$|At a {{corporate}} level, the Bangladesh Premier League considers itself an association {{made up of}} and financed by its member teams. All income generated through television rights, licensing agreements, sponsorship, ticket sales and other <b>means</b> <b>is</b> earned and shared between the Bangladesh Cricket Board and the participating franchises. The league is controlled by a Governing Council (GC). As the parent organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board appoints the GC's members.|$|E
25|$|What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> {{that even}} if we have {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|In {{large scale}} river {{navigation}} improvements, weirs and locks are used together. A weir {{will increase the}} depth of a shallow stretch, and the required lock will either be built in {{a gap in the}} weir, or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it. A river improved by these <b>means</b> <b>is</b> often called a Waterway or River Navigation (see example Calder and Hebble Navigation).|$|E
30|$|In {{the data}} {{preparation}} step (Step 3), we first calculated {{the mean score}} of MSLQ. Those respondents with a score less than the <b>mean</b> <b>were</b> labeled as low motivation (LM) students, while those with more than the <b>mean</b> <b>were</b> labeled as high motivation (HM) students. The sample consisted of 76 LM and 76 HM students (the <b>mean</b> <b>was</b> equal to the median).|$|R
50|$|For n = 1 or 2, the {{midrange}} and the <b>mean</b> <b>are</b> equal (and {{coincide with}} the median), and are most efficient for all distributions. For n = 3, the modified <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the median, and instead the <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the most efficient {{measure of central tendency}} for values of γ2 from 2.0 to 6.0 as well as from &minus;0.8 to 2.0.|$|R
2500|$|Estimators {{capable of}} coping with {{outliers}} {{are said to be}} robust: the median is a robust statistic of central tendency, while the <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> not. However, the <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> generally more precise estimator.|$|R
25|$|A {{stream of}} {{observations}} in the 1980s indicated its presence, including gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters, the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters, and {{the pattern of}} anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. According to consensus among cosmologists, dark matter is composed primarily of a not yet characterized type of subatomic particle. The search for this particle, {{by a variety of}} <b>means,</b> <b>is</b> one of the major efforts in particle physics.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it}} is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{even though}} some {{individual}} slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that {{is very different from}} saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced {{than it would have been}} in the absence of slavery. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that, whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the...aggrandizement of slaveowners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Means</b> <b>are</b> usually homogeneous, but {{for most}} {{functions}} , the f-mean is not.Indeed, the only homogeneous quasi-arithmetic <b>means</b> <b>are</b> the power <b>means</b> and the geometric mean; see Hardy - Littlewood - Pólya, page 68.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} {{standard error}} of a sample <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the standard error divided by the mean and expressed as a percentage. It can only be calculated if the <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> a non-zero value.|$|R
