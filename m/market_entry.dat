40|$|ABSTRACT∗∗: Universal service {{obligations}} {{are usually}} not competitively neutral as they modify the way firms compete in the market. In this paper, we consider a continuum of local markets in a dynamic setting with a stochastically growing demand. The incumbent must serve all markets (ubiquity) possibly at a uniform price and an entrant decides on its market coverage before firms compete in prices. Connecting a market involves a sunk cost. We show that {{the imposition of a}} uniform price constraint modifies the timing of entry: for low connection cost <b>markets,</b> <b>entry</b> occurs earlier while for high connection cost <b>markets,</b> <b>entry</b> occurs later. ...|$|R
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{the biggest}} barrier to local vaccine {{production}} in {{less developed countries}} has not been patents, but the substantial financial, infrastructure, and workforce expertise requirements needed for <b>market</b> <b>entry.</b> Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In {{the case of a}} few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.|$|E

In 1938, Rüstow met with a variety of economic thinkers—including the likes of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek and William Roepke—to determine how liberalism could be renewed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the following important questions in international business. How do multinational enterprises (MNEs) choose ownership strategies when facing strong uncertainty in foreign <b>market</b> <b>entries?</b> How are the choices affected by industry contingencies? Following the key tenets of real options theory, we propose that, under {{a high level}} of market uncertainty, MNEs choose more flexible (rather than more committed) ownership strategies that allow adjustment of investment decisions in future. We further suggest that using flexible strategies in response to uncertainty becomes less valuable for MNEs when the industry they enter in the host country enjoys strong sales growth potential, requires less irreversible investments, and has intense competition. Empirically, we analyze the ownership strategies (ownership structure and equity share) of over 5000 new foreign investments in manufacturing industries in China during 2000 – 2006. We find qualified support for our hypotheses, and discuss the industry boundary conditions of adopting flexible ownership strategies in foreign <b>market</b> <b>entries.</b> ...|$|R
