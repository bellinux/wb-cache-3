50|$|Eventually, on 26 January 1998, what {{remained}} of the company (including DEC's <b>multivendor</b> global services organization and customer support centers) was sold to PC manufacturer Compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry. Several years earlier, Compaq had considered a bid for DEC but became seriously interested only after DEC's major divestments and refocusing on the Internet in 1997. At the time of Compaq's acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues. After the merger closed, Compaq moved aggressively to reduce DEC’s high selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs (equal to 24% of total 1997 revenues) and bring them more in line with Compaq’s SG&A expense ratio of 12% of revenues.|$|E
50|$|Prior to OSI, {{networking}} {{was largely}} either government-sponsored (ARPANET in the US, CYCLADES in France) or vendor-developed and proprietary standards (such as the System network architecture (SNA) of IBM and DECnet of Digital Equipment Corporation). An Experimental Packet Switched {{system in the}} UK circa 1973, also identified the need to define higher level protocols. The NCC (UK) publication 'Why Distributed Computing' which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. OSI was hence an industry effort, attempting to get industry participants to agree on common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability. It was common for large networks to support multiple network protocol suites, with many devices unable to interoperate with other devices {{because of a lack}} of common protocols. However, while OSI developed its networking standards, TCP/IP came into widespread use on <b>multivendor</b> networks for internetworking, while on the local network level both Ethernet and token ring gained prominence.|$|E
5000|$|.....prior to {{the final}} release of DirectX 8.0, Microsoft {{decided that it was}} better to expose the RADEON's and GeForce{2}'s {{extended}} multitexture capabilities via the extensions to SetTextureStageState (...) instead of via the pixel shader interface. There are various practical technical reasons for this. Much of the same math that can be done with pixel shaders can be done via SetTextureStageState (...) , especially with the enhancements to SetTextureStageState (...) in DirectX 8.0. At the end of the day, this means that DirectX 8.0 exposes 99% of what the RADEON can do in its pixel pipe without adding the complexity of a [...] "0.5" [...] pixel shader interface.Additionally, {{you have to understand that}} the phrase [...] "shader" [...] is an incredibly ambiguous graphics term. Basically, we hardware manufacturers started using the word [...] "shader" [...] a lot once we were able to do per-pixel dot products (i.e. the RADEON / GF generation of chips). Even earlier than that, [...] "ATI_shader_op" [...] was our multitexture OpenGL extension on Rage 128 (which was replaced by the <b>multivendor</b> EXT_texture_env_combine extension). Quake III has [...] ".shader" [...] files it uses to describe how materials are lit. These are just a few examples of the use of the word shader in the game industry (nevermind the movie production industry which uses many different types of shaders, including those used by Pixar's RenderMan).With the final release of DirectX 8.0, the term [...] "shader" [...] has become more crystallized in that it is actually used in the interface that developers use to write their programs rather than just general [...] "industry lingo." [...] In DirectX 8.0, there are two versions of pixel shaders: 1.0 and 1.1. (Future releases of DirectX will have 2.0 shaders, 3.0 shaders and so on.) Because of what I stated earlier, RADEON doesn't support either of the pixel shader versions in DirectX 8.0. Some of you have tweaked the registry and gotten the driver to export a 1.0 pixel shader version number to 3DMark2001. This causes 3DMark2001 to think it can run certain tests. Surely, we shouldn't crash when you do this, but you are forcing the (leaked and/or unsupported) driver down a path it isn't intended to ever go. The chip doesn't support 1.0 or 1.1 pixel shaders, therefore you won't see correct rendering even if we don't crash. The fact that that registry key exists indicates that we did some experiments in the driver, not that we are half way done implementing pixel shaders on RADEON. DirectX 8.0's 1.0 and 1.1 pixel shaders are not supported by RADEON and never will be. The silicon just can't do what is required to support 1.0 or 1.1 shaders. This is also true of GeForce and GeForce2.|$|E

40|$|Today's {{businesses}} {{focus on}} their core competences and buy all other business functions from other companies. Multisourcing happens when a project is divided between more than one company. Some companies are created to purely answer to these outsourcing needs. Atostek Oy is one such company participating in many multisourcing projects. While outsourcing might seem like {{an easy way to}} handle non-essential business functions, it does require planning, organizing and communication from the company doing the outsourcing as well as the company the function is outsourced to. This adds challenges to the project managers on all ends. Version control is essential in all software projects. It is essential that each version is tracked and accessible. Nowadays software projects are often so large that it is important for multiple developers to collaborate on them and therefore have access to all versions of the software. Often version control has been handled using a centralized version control system. In these cases each company participating in a <b>multivendor</b> project sets up their own version control system and work on only their part of the software. The interfaces between parts and all communication about the project, such as documents and contracts, are shared between companies via another method. Nowadays distributed version control systems are becoming increasingly popular and o er multiple alternative ways of setting up the version control mechanism within a company as well as between companies. In this thesis, <b>multivendor</b> projects that Atostek Oy participates in are investigated. First a study is conducted to see how the <b>multivendor</b> projects are managed.

40|$|Abstract. Research {{on global}} <b>multivendor</b> {{information}} systems development (ISD) out-sourcing projects has uncovered several management challenges, resulting {{mainly from the}} complexity of coordinating multiple vendors across geographical locations. However, a gap persists regarding effective management practices in this context. This study em-ploys an exploratory, single-case study design with grounded theory techniques to gen-erate new, empirically grounded theory regarding mindful management practices. In particular, (1) relational knowledge {{should be viewed as}} an enabler but not as a stand-ard recipe for interfirm cooperation, (2) cross-organizational trial-and-error learning pro-cesses should be leveraged early in the project, (3) intervendor power relations should be determined on the basis of expertise, and (4) multichannel communication should be structured around the context. These four practices are supported by theoretical in-sights drawn from organizational mindfulness theory: commitment to resilience, preoc-cupation with failure, under-specification of structures, and sensitivity to operations. Therefore, the papers main theoretical contribution is the introduction and extension of organizational mindfulness to the domain of global <b>multivendor</b> sourcing, marking an important first step for extending prior theory to the context of interorganizational exchange relationships and networks, with key implications for research and practice...|$|E
