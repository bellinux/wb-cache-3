40|$|Introduction: Several {{methods are}} {{available}} for the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous disease. Since the immunohistochemistry of complement component is easy and more accessible compared to other methods, {{it is thought that}} this technique as an efficient method can replace other difficult, and time-consuming procedures. Therefore, in this study we aimed to systematically review the literatures in which the diagnostic value of complement component 3 d (C 3 d) and C 4 d had been investigated in bullous pemphigoid. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, Google scholar, and Scopus using following search method (((C 3 <b>d</b> <b>OR</b> C 4 <b>d</b> <b>OR</b> complement component 3 <b>d</b> <b>OR</b> complement component 4 <b>d</b> immunohistochemistry)) <b>OR</b> (C 3 <b>d</b> <b>OR</b> C 4 <b>d</b> marker <b>OR</b> complement component 3 <b>d</b> <b>OR</b> complement component 4 d marker)) AND (bullous pemphigoid OR cutaneous pemphigoid) to evaluate the diagnostic value of C 3 d and/or C 4 d for early and accurate detection of bullous pemphigoid on November 2015. Subsequently, the extracted data were described. Result: Total of 28 documents were collected and reviewed based on the purpose of this study. Of the collected articles, 21 documents were excluded in several steps of article selection process and only 7 relevant articles were included for data assessment. The results showed that the deposits of C 3 d and/or C 4 d in skin biopsies were found in 125 of 134 patients, indicating that immunohistochemistry is a reliable technique for the diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases. Conclusion: The results of this review showed that C 3 d and/or C 4 d immunohistochemistry in skin biopsies is a reliable technique for the diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases, particularly bullous pemphigoid...|$|R

40|$|Background : Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The reported prevalence of H. pylori in the adult population in Turkey is 67. 6 %– 81. 3 %. A national meta-analysis showed that the average H. pylori eradication rate with proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens in Turkey had decreased from 84 % in 1997 to 55. 3 % in 2004, suggesting a need to evaluate alternative regimens. Materials and methods : The study was a prospective, single-center trial with a parallel group design. After the selection procedure, consecutive out-patients were assigned to one of six study groups using random sampling numbers. All patients received amoxicillin 1, 000 mg b. i. d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b. i. d. along with ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b. i. <b>d.,</b> <b>or</b> omeprazole 20 mg b. i. <b>d.,</b> <b>or</b> lansoprazole 30 mg b. i. <b>d.,</b> <b>or</b> rabeprazole 20 mg b. i. <b>d.,</b> <b>or</b> pantoprazole 40 mg b. i. <b>d.,</b> <b>or</b> esomeprazole 40 mg b. i. d. for 14 days. Results : When we look at the eradication rates of the treatment groups, only two groups (ranitidine bismuth citrate and rabeprazole groups) had eradication rates greater than 80 %, both at intention to treat and per protocol analyses. The other four groups (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole groups) showed statistically significant lower eradication rates both at intention to treat (between 57. 6 and 66. 7 %) and per protocol (between 60. 3 and 72. 1 %) analyses when compared with ranitidine bismuth citrate and rabeprazole groups (p<. 05). Conclusion : Ranitidine bismuth citrate and/or rabeprazole based triple therapies must be preferred for the first-line treatment of H. pylori infection...|$|R
