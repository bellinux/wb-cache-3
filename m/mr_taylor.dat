2500|$|.....about six moons ago, I with my [...] {{and child}} (male) were encamped with thirty others Aboriginal natives, men, women and children, upon the Bor-rang-yallock, when <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> and many poor men (shepherds) came towards our miam-miams with guns, <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> was on horseback, {{they came up}} in an {{extended}} line <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> in the centre they advanced quick and immediately fired upon the natives, I ran {{to the other side}} of the river and lay down behind a tree among the grass, they killed more than thirty men women and children, my lubra and child were among the dead, the white people threw them into the water and soon left the place, the water was much stained with blood, I saw the dead body of my lubra but did not see my child. I remained for two days near the spot. Two days after the murder Yi-yi-ran (Mr Andreson) and Mr Watson came and saw the bodies and seemed sorry and said to <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> why did you kill so many lubras and children. Yi-yi-ran, Charles Courtney, James Ramslie and James Hamilton, burned the bodies, and made fires. <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor,</b> Mr Andreson and Mr Watson came on horseback two days after with a sack and took away part of the bones not consumed.|$|E
2500|$|What {{proof is}} there of the Blacks having killed the sheep? The {{shepherd}} said so. Might not the shepherd {{have done it}} himself and after keeping the hindquarters for his own use have given the forequarters to the natives ... If {{this is the only}} charge <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> can allege against the aboriginal natives it certainly amounts to very little. In point of law it proved it is an offence, but who in the name of common humanity I would ask would think of injuring those already too much injured people, and for such a trifle ...|$|E
2500|$|.....The party {{advanced}} in an extended line upon the natives, <b>Mr</b> <b>Taylor</b> {{was in the}} centre of the line, the shepherds were on each side of him, they advanced shouting and immediately fired upon the natives who were asleep. They succeeded in killing all they could see, amounting to thirty five (35). I was particular in ascertaining the exact number and they (the natives) gave me the same number over and over again. The slaughtered consisted of men, women and children. The abovenamed native was one of the party attacked and succeeded in hiding himself among the long grass and thus escaped. The whites immediately threw the bodies into a waterhole, and left the spot leaving the bodies there.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from sign language, Taylor {{would let}} it be known that he {{disagreed}} with an umpire's call by holding his nose and spinning the second finger of his other hand near his temple, demonstrating his belief that the ump was screwy. [...] In June 1905, umpire Hank O'Day ejected Taylor for hand gestures that he interpreted to be an accusation that [...] "I had wheels in my head." [...] A press account described the scene:He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand observed a lightning movement of the hands. [...] Mystic symbol followed mystic symbol, and the crowd kept guessing, what it meant. [...] Suddenly O'Day, too, strode forward and majestically waved <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> from the field. [...] Still frantically making rotary movements around his temples, [...] "Dummy" [...] dawdled away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gest makes a {{specific}} {{reference to the}} Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit {{is due to the}} nineteenth century antiquarian Joseph Hunter, who correctly identified the site of the Saylis. From this location it was once possible to look out over the Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the Great North Road. The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to Edward III in 1346–47 for the knighting of the Black Prince. An acre of landholding is listed within a glebe terrier of 1688 relating to Kirk Smeaton, which later came to be called [...] "Sailes Close". Professor Dobson and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as [...] "Sayles Plantation". It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hood's Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of Campsall.|$|E
2500|$|Masterson was {{appointed}} city marshal of Trinidad, Colorado, on April 17, 1882. He had hardly settled into his $75-a-month marshal's job when Wyatt Earp requested Masterson's help {{to prevent the}} extradition of John Henry [...] "Doc" [...] Holliday from Colorado to Arizona. Masterson took his case directly to Colorado Governor Frederick W. Pitkin, who listened to Masterson's appeal and finally refused to grant Holliday's extradition. Masterson's rescue of Doc Holliday, and his nightly [...] "moonlighting" [...] as a faro dealer spelled doom for his career as city marshal of Trinidad. On March 28, 1883, a local paper noted: [...] "There are now two 'bankers' running for city offices – <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> of the Las Animas County Bank, and Mr. Masterson {{of the bank of}} 'Fair O.' Both have a large number of depositors – one of time depositors and the other receives his deposits for keeps." [...] The voters of Trinidad got the message. On April 3, 1883, Masterson was defeated by a lopsided vote of 637 to 248.|$|E

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor,</b> the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

6000|$|In {{conclusion}} I will relate {{a little}} incident which occurred several months later, when I was again {{on a visit}} to my old friend the shepherd. We were sitting together on a Sunday evening, when his old wife looked out and said, [...] "Lor, here be <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Taylor</b> with her children coming in to see us." [...] And <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Taylor</b> soon appeared, wheeling her baby in a perambulator, with two little girls following. She was a comely, round, rosy little woman, with black hair, black eyes, and a singularly sweet expression, and her three pretty little children were like her. She stayed half an hour in pleasant chat, then went her way down the road to her home. Who, I asked, was <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Taylor?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Stratton became {{acquainted with}} this, and got <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> {{and others to}} lend me four lacs of pagodas towards {{discharging}} the arrears of pay of my troops. Upon this, I wrote a letter of thanks to Mr. Stratton; and upon the faith of this money being paid immediately, I ordered many of my troops to be discharged by a certain day, and lessened the number of my servants. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor,</b> &c., some time after acquainted me, {{that they had no}} ready money, but they would grant teeps payable in four months. This astonished me; for I did not know what might happen, when the sepoys were dismissed from my service. I begged of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> and the others to pay this sum to the officers of my regiments at the time they mentioned; and desired the officers, at the same time, to pacify and persuade the men belonging to them that their pay would be given to them at the end of four months, and that, till those arrears were discharged, their pay should be continued to them. Two years are nearly expired since that time, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> has not yet entirely discharged the arrears of those troops, and I am obliged to continue their pay from that time till this. I hoped to have been able, by this expedient, to have lessened the number of my troops, and discharged the arrears due to them, considering the trifle of interest to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> and the others as no great matter; but instead of this, I am oppressed with the burden of pay due to those troops, and the interest, which is going on to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> from the day the teeps were granted to him."

6000|$|... [225] 'There is {{a rhetorical}} {{amplitude}} and brilliancy in the Messias,' says Mr. Carlyle, 'which elicits in our critic (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor)</b> an instinct truer than his philosophy is. Neither has the still purer spirit of Klopstock's odes escaped him. Perhaps {{there is no}} writing in our language that offers so correct an emblem of him as this analysis.' I remember thinking Taylor's 'clear outline' of the Messias the most satisfying account of a poem I ever read: it fills the mind with a vision of pomp and magnificence, which it is pleasanter to contemplate, as it were, from afar, massed together in that general survey, than to examine part by part. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> and Mr. Carlyle agree in exalting that ode of Klopstock's, in which he represents the Muse of Britain and the Muse of Germany running a race. The piece seems to me more rhetorical than strictly poetical; and if the younger Muse's power of keeping up the race depends on productions of this sort, I would not give a penny for her chance, at least if the contest relates to pure poetry. Klopstock's Herman (mentioned afterwards,) consists of three chorus-dramas, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Taylor</b> calls them: The Battle of Herman, Herman and the Princes, and The Death of Herman. Herman is the Arminius of the Roman historians. S.C.|$|E
