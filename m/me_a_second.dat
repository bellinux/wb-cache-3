'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I {{think it would be}} a good gig for someone to do."

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was filmed over {{the night of}} July 23â€“24, 2008 at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama after most flights had landed for the night. It was {{directed}} by the Erwin Brothers and premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on August 23, 2008. The video is mainly set in an airport as Brandon Heath walks among people, with interspersed shots of Heath sitting on steps and singing. The scenes of Heath sitting on stairs and in a chair were filmed in the older 1962 Birmingham Air Terminal which is adjacent to the current terminal and no longer used for passenger traffic. In {{the bridge of the}} song, a portion of the video is played backwards as he sings the lines [...] "I want a second glance/So give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> chance/To see the way You see the people all alone". In the last chorus, a few of the previous scenes are replayed as Heath now helps with people's individual situations. In one of the early shots, a woman steps in front of an approaching car; it is replayed as Heath intervenes and stops her from being hit by the car. The video's airport scene included about 100 extras.|$|E
