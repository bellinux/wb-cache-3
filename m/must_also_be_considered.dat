5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered,</b> leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities {{that need to}} remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It {{is also important to}} keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E

50|$|Arnold Lazarus {{added the}} idea that, since {{personality}} <b>is</b> multi-dimensional, treatment <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> multiple dimensions of personality to be effective. His idea of MMT involves examining symptoms on each dimension of personality {{in order to}} find the right combination of therapeutic techniques to address them all. Lazarus retained the basic premises of CBT, but believed that more of the individual's specific needs and personality dimensions must <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b>|$|R

25|$|Human comfort levels <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> Storage {{areas can}} often {{get away with}} {{slightly}} lower temperatures than display areas since they are not accessed as often, and it is most likely that those who do enter the space will {{be prepared for the}} conditions. In galleries, however, viewers must feel comfortable enough with the temperature to spend time there, otherwise the collection will simply not be viewed and lose its purpose in being on display.|$|E
25|$|Safety <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> {{with respect}} to both methods. So far, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{guidelines}} have only approved the use of TMS {{for the treatment of}} depression. Although this technique has no known lasting side effects except for a few reported cases of induced seizures, it is still treated with caution due to its relative novelty in clinical use. CSM has gained U.S. FDA approval for its uses regarding cortical stimulation mapping, especially in cases of seizure and glioma treatments, and for aiding in the placement of electrodes within the brain.|$|E
25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe spasticity must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
5000|$|Requirements labeled as Must {{have are}} {{critical}} to the current delivery timebox in order {{for it to be}} a success. If even one Must have requirement is not included, the project delivery should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a failure (note: requirements can be downgraded from Must have, by agreement with all relevant stakeholders; for example, when new requirements are deemed more important). <b>MUST</b> can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> an acronym for the Minimum Usable SubseT.|$|R
30|$|ATE systems <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{validated}} <b>considering</b> {{the recall}} rates obtained by these systems, i.e., {{whether they are}} able to extract all of the (or most of the) terminological units foreseen by the domain experts. Usually, when the systems obtain high precision, the recall is low and vice versa. For example, a corpus of a specific domain has 50 terms and an ATE system correctly extracted two of these terms. Considering this result, the precision rate obtained by this system was 100 %, but the recall rate is 4 %.|$|R
5000|$|The book's {{contributors}} significantly {{elaborate on}} the nature of military discipline. Rewards and punishments are necessary in shaping the actions of the military. Because a worthy person could become self-important and disrupt the integrity of the military if reward is excessive or unpredictable, rewards must be appropriate and consistent in order to be most effective. Punishment <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> carefully <b>considered.</b> When the military experiences failure, the commander must encourage everyone to accept responsibility, including himself. If he singles out an officer, the troops could infer that the officer alone was responsible and avoid improvement.|$|R
25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we have studied {{resource}} allocation in the C-RAN CoMP paradigm using non-coherent JT, and have introduced a service-aware user-centric scheme for the downlink that achieves fairness in a multi-point fashion.

Service-awareness in scheduling <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> achieved <b>considering</b> that each user’s activity is different {{in terms of the}} traffic type.

500|$|Amalric died in 1174, and Baldwin IV succeeded him as king. Nur ad-Din {{also died}} in 1174, and his general Saladin {{spent the rest}} of the decade {{consolidating}} his hold on both Egypt and Nur ad-Din's possessions in Syria, which allowed him to completely encircle Jerusalem. The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, a [...] "court party" [...] and a [...] "noble party." [...] The [...] "court party" [...] was led by Baldwin's mother, Amalric's first wife Agnes of Courtenay, and her immediate family, as well as recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and were in favour of war with Saladin. The [...] "noble party" [...] was led by Raymond III of Tripoli and the native nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William himself in the Historia, and it was taken as fact by later historians. Peter W. Edbury, however, has more recently argued that William must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with Raymond, who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices. The accounts of the 13th-century authors who continued the Historia in French <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> suspect, as they were allied to Raymond's supporters in the Ibelin family.

However, one should consider the capacity of the teachers to produce it, if materials are not supplied. Additionally, if electricity is a problem in an area, one may need to look for an alternative, as using video will certainly put pressure on local resources.

2500|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost.

40|$|Information {{visualization}} is a user-centered design discipline. In {{this article}} we argue, however, that designing information visualization techniques often requires more than designing for user requirements. Additionally, the data that are to <b>be</b> visualized <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> carefully <b>considered.</b> An approach based on both the user and their data is encapsulated by two questions, which we argue information visualization designers should continually ask themselves: ‘What does the user want to see?’ and ‘What do the data want to be?’ As we show by presenting cases, these two points of departure are mutually reinforcing. By focusing on the data, new insight is gained into {{the requirements of the}} user, and vice versa, resulting in more effective visualization techniques...|$|R
2500|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that p-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice {{that has been}} particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any p-value nominally less than [...]05 without other supporting evidence. Although p-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered,</b> such as [...] "the design of a study, {{the quality of the}} measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis". Another concern is that the p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Some statisticians have proposed replacing p-values with alternative measures of evidence, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret p-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.|$|E

How numerous the source is <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered,</b> as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the critical parameter for any source considered can be summarized as its [...] "emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume." [...] With these constraints, it is expected that quasars and first generation stars and galaxies were the main sources of energy.|$|E
