Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's {{work in this area}} was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like <b>mass,</b> <b>velocity,</b> force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.|$|E

Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{mechanism}} of flow boiling critical heat flux (CHF) in a 2. 5 mm x 5 mm rectangular channel that is heated along one of its walls for horizontal and vertical upflow configurations. Using FC- 72 as working fluid, experiments were performed with <b>mass</b> <b>velocities</b> ranging from 185 - 1600 kg/m 2 s. A key objective {{of this study is}} to assess the influence of inlet vapor void on CHF. This influence is examined with the aid of high-sped video motion analysis of interfacial features at heat fluxes up to CHF as well as during the CHF transient. ^ For horizontal configuration the flow is observed to enter the heated portion of the channel separated into two layers, with vapor residing above liquid. Just prior to CHF, a third vapor layer begins to develop at the leading edge of the heated wall beneath the liquid layer. Because of buoyancy effects and mixing between the three layers, the flow is less discernible in the downstream region of the heated wall, especially at high <b>mass</b> <b>velocities.</b> The observed behavior is used to construct a new separated three-layer model that facilitates the prediction of individual layer velocities and thicknesses.

Leibniz had already shown that this quantity is likely to be either minimised or maximised in natural phenomena.

40|$|The {{transition}} from single-phase to two-phase thermal systems in future space vehicles demands {{a thorough understanding}} of phase change methods in reduced gravity, including microgravity. In this study, phase change methods like flow boiling, flow condensation and evaporative falling-films are investigated experimentally, theoretically and computationally. ^ The experimental part of the study consists of an investigation of the influence of inlet subcooling and two-phase inlet on flow boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux in a horizontal 2. 5 -mm wide by 5 -mm high rectangular channel in different orientations with respect to Earth gravity using FC- 72 as working fluid. High-speed video imaging is used to identify dominant interfacial characteristics for different combinations of inlet conditions and heating configurations. Gravity is shown having a dominant influence on interfacial behavior at low <b>mass</b> <b>velocities,</b> while inertia dwarfs gravity effects at high <b>mass</b> <b>velocities.</b> CHF variation between different orientations with respect to Earth gravity is large for low <b>mass</b> <b>velocities</b> and diminishes for high <b>mass</b> <b>velocities.</b> ^ In the theoretical part of the study, a consolidated investigation of the complex trends of flow boiling CHF in a rectangular channel in both microgravity and for different orientations in Earth gravity are performed. Separate theoretical models are constructed to investigate subcooled inlet flows and saturated two-phase inlet flows. It is shown that the Interfacial Lift-off Model provides good predictions of CHF data for both gravitational environments, both single-sided and double-sided heating, and both subcooled and saturated inlet conditions. ^ In the computational part of the study, CFD models are constructed for two separate phase change configurations. First, turbulent, free-falling liquid films subjected to evaporative heating, and second, annular flow condensation in vertical upflow configuration. Implemented in FLUENT, the models are used to predict variations of various flow and thermal parameters and compare the results with available experimental data. Energy transfer at the two-phase interface are implemented successfully with the aid of appropriate phase change models. For both phase change configurations, the CFD model was able to capture complex flow behavior observed in experiments and predict heat transfer coefficients with reasonable accuracy. Also included in this part is a comprehensive review of literature on computational modeling of various boiling and condensation applications. This part of the study is laying the groundwork for future implementation of CFD models in capturing more complicated flow boiling and CHF phenomena. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} for flow {{boiling heat transfer}} coefficient and critical heat flux (CHF) in small flattened tubes. The tested flattened tubes have the same equivalent internal diameter of 2. 2 mm, but different aspect height/width ratios (H/W) of 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 2 and 4. The experimental data were compared against results for circular tubes using R 134 a and R 245 fa as working fluids at a nominal saturation temperature of 31 degrees C. For <b>mass</b> <b>velocities</b> higher than 200 kg/m(2) s, the flattened and circular tubes presented similar heat transfer coefficients. Such a behavior {{is related to the}} fact that stratification effects are negligible under conditions of higher <b>mass</b> <b>velocities.</b> Heat transfer correlations from the literature, usually developed using only circular-channel experimental data, predicted the flattened tube results for <b>mass</b> <b>velocities</b> higher than 200 kg/m(2) s with mean absolute error lower than 20 % using the equivalent diameter to account for the geometry effect. Similarly, the critical heat flux results were found to be independent of the tube aspect ratio when the same equivalent length was kept. Equivalent length is a new parameter which takes into account the channel heat transfer area. The CHF correlations for round tubes predicted the flattened tube data relatively well when using the equivalent diameter and length. Furthermore, a new proposed CHF correlation predicted the present flattened tube data with a mean absolute error of 5 %. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
