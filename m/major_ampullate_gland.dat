The relationship between structure and mechanical properties of spider silk is not well understood.

The artificial genes sequence of the hydrophobic core regions of spidroin 1 and 2 have been designed using computer analysis of existing databases and mathematical modeling. Both pro-teins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using a cation exchange chromatography. Despite the absence of hydrophilic N- and C-termini, both purified proteins spontaneously formed the nanofibrils and round micelle...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} half of this century, several workers {{observed}} small, seemingly glandular structures attached to the <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> of spiders. Hence, they were termed accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> In juvenile Araneus cavaticus, two pairs of these structures are present (starting at least with third instars), one pair attached to the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) <b>glands</b> and the other pair attached to the minor <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) <b>glands.</b> In adults, two pairs of accessory MaA glands and two pairs of accessory MiA glands are present. The two latter-formed pairs of accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> are clearly the remnants of those <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> which atrophy shortly after adulthood is reached. Morphological similarities between these accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> and those present in juveniles provide an indication that the latter also have their origin in functional <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> A reduction in the number of <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> following the last molt occurs in many spiders. The reason(s) for these reductions is unknown. In penultimate spiders close to ecdysis, we have observed that while the larger pairs of MaA and MiA glands (those that are retained in the adult) are undergoing molt-related changes which apparently render them nonfunctional, their smaller counterparts are seemingly unaffected and functional. This raises the possibility that the principal role of the smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> may be to assume functions during the pre-ecdysial period which are normally in the domain of the larger <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> If true, then their degeneration after the last molt would make economic sense...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{means by}} which female wolf spiders attach an egg sac to their spinnerets was inves-tigated using {{scanning}} electron microscopy. In four Pardosa species, we observed that silk fibers emerging from <b>ampullate</b> <b>gland</b> spigots had been affixed {{to the surface of}} the egg sac. More specifically, primary (18) and secondary (28) <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) <b>glands</b> and 18 and 28 minor <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) <b>glands</b> all contributed fibers for this purpose. The diameters of the 28 MaA and 28 MiA fibers were greater than those of the 18 MaA and 18 MiA fibers and, correspondingly, the widths of the 28 ampullate spigots were clearly greater than those of the 18 ampullate spigots. Larger 28 ampullate spigots were also observed in adult females of species from three other lycosid genera. Thus, 28 <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands,</b> which in araneoids function only in juveniles during proecdysis, are not only functional in adult female lycosids (and adult females of several other families), but they appear to play a greater role than the 18 <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> in egg sac attachment. Observations made on the 18 and 28 ampullate spigots of adult females from species belonging to several other families are also presented.

40|$|<b>Major</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) {{and minor}} <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) silk <b>glands</b> of {{juvenile}} Araneus cavaticus (third to penultimate instars) were examined by dissection {{at various times}} relative to ecdysis. Several days before ecdysis the larger pairs of MaA and MiA glands become non-functional and remain so until ecdysis. Nevertheless, proecdysial spiders are able to drawl ampullate fibres due {{to the presence of}} smaller pairs of MaA and MiA glands which are functional at this time. Indeed, it appears that these smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> are intended for use only during proecdysis. Thus, larger MaA and MiA glands and smaller MaA and MiA glands are typically not used concurrently (a brief transitional period is an exception). The smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> functioning in one juvenile stadium regress in the following stadium and become (what have previously been referred to as) accessory MaA and MiA glands. These non-functional accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> do not re-develop into functional smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> until the following stadium. Thus, a given pair of smaller MaA or MiA glands is only functional in every other juvenile stadium. However, because there are two sets of smaller/accessory MaA and MiA glands which function alternately, the spider is able to produce ampullate fibres during the proecdysial portion of each stadium.

40|$|Spidroin- 1 {{is one of}} the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk {{proteins}} {{produced by}} spiders for use {{in the construction of the}} frame and radii of orb webs, and as a dragline to escape from predators. Only partial sequences of spidroin- 1 produced by Nephila clavipes have been reported up to now, and there is no information on post-translational modifications (PTMs). A gel-based mass spectrometry strategy with ETD and CID fragmentation methods were used to sequence and determine the presence/location of any PTMs on the spidroin- 1. Sequence coverage of 98. 06 %, 95. 05 %, and 98. 37 % were obtained for N. clavipes, Nephila edulis and for Nephila madagascariensis, respectively. Phosphorylation was the major PTM observed with 8 phosphorylation sites considered reliable on spidroin- 1 produced by N. clavipes, 4 in N. madagascariensis and 2 for N. edulis. Dityrosine and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (formed by oxidation of the spidroin- 1) were observed, although the mechanism by which they are formed (i. e. exposure to UV radiation or to peroxidases in the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk <b>gland)</b> is uncertain. Herein we present structural information on the spidroin- 1 produced by three different Nephila species; these findings may be valuable for understanding the physicochemical properties of the silk proteins and moreover, future designs of recombinantly produced spider silk proteins. Biotechnological significance: The present investigation shows for the first time spidroin structure and post-translational modifications observed on the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk spidroin- 1. The many site specific phosphorylations (localized within the structural motifs) along with the probably photoinduction of hydroxylations may be relevant for scientists in material science, biology, biochemistry and environmental scientists. Up to now all the mechanical properties of the spidroin have been characterized without any consideration about the existence of PTMs in the sequence of spidroins. Thus, these findings for <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk spidroin- 1 from Nephila spiders provide the basis for mechanical?elastic property studies of silk for biotechnological and biomedical potential applications.

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{material properties}} of spider dragline silk fibers {{have been attributed}} to two spidroins, <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> spidroins 1 and 2 (MaSp 1 and MaSp 2). Although dragline silk fibers have been treated with different chemical solvents to elucidate the relationship between protein structure and fiber mechanics, {{there has not been a}} comprehensive proteomic analysis of the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MA) <b>gland,</b> its spinning dope, and dragline silk using a wide range of chaotropic agents, inorganic salts, and fluorinated alcohols to elucidate their complete molecular constituents. In these studies, we perform in-solution tryptic digestions of solubilized MA glands, spinning dope and dragline silk fibers using five different solvents, followed by nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis with an Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™. To improve protein identification, we employed three different tryptic peptide fragmentation modes, which included collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and high energy collision dissociation (HCD) to discover proteins involved in the silk assembly pathway and silk fiber. In addition to MaSp 1 and MaSp 2, we confirmed the presence of a third spidroin, aciniform spidroin 1 (AcSp 1), widely recognized as the major constituent of wrapping silk, as a product of dragline silk. Our findings also reveal that MA glands, spinning dope, and dragline silk contain at least seven common proteins: three members of the Cysteine-Rich Protein Family (CRP 1, CRP 2 and CRP 4), cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP 3), fasciclin and two uncharacterized proteins.

Spinning field features overall suggest Phobetinus is most closely related to Mimetus, followed by Australomimetus, then Ero.
