5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of acknowledgements and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her reading. From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely being recognized.|$|E

There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals. The Canadian delegates stayed each night on board the SS Queen Victoria, as circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town.|$|E
25|$|When {{the user}} encrypts files {{after the first}} stage of such an attack, the FEKs are {{automatically}} encrypted with the designated DRA's public key. The attacker only needs to access the computer once more as Administrator to gain full access to all those subsequently EFS-encrypted files. Even using Syskey mode 2 or 3 does not protect against this attack, because the attacker could back up the encrypted files offline, restore them elsewhere and use the DRA's private key to decrypt the files. Of course, if such a malicious insider can gain physical access to the computer, you might consider all security features to be irrelevant, because they could also install rootkits, software or even hardware keyloggers etc. on the computer – which is potentially <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and effective than overwriting DRA policy.|$|E

Though the French army in this war remained superior, the Allies fought and sometimes won, some large-scale open battles, like the Battle of Saint-Denis (1678). Despite {{the fact that at}} the beginning of this war the Republic had almost been obliterated, it did not have to make concessions to the French at the Peace, unlike Spain that lost appreciable territory in the Southern Netherlands.|$|E

500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept. From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, but what she felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> I could pull a thousand cases out of my head people would say would never happen.

Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> to see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E

[...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in.

[...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we {{might have had a}} case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments.

500|$|Publicity {{photos and}} music videos {{promoting}} Maxinquaye featured Tricky and Topley-Bird utilizing androgynous imagery. They were photographed {{on one occasion}} wearing gender-bending clothing such as a mufti. Other promotional shots based on a wedding concept captured Topley-Bird dressed as the groom. As The Independents Phil Johnson recalled, the very thin Tricky was dressed in drag as the bride and his sickly looking face [...] "painted and preened", with smeared lipstick and a false eyelash {{in the style of}} Alex from the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. In Johnson's opinion, the record's gender-bending promotional efforts were canny in how they [...] "maximized Maxinquayes cross-genre potential". According to Reynolds and Joy Press, while [...] "most post-rock 'n' roll forms of popular music ideologically rest on rebellions against the feminine", Tricky [...] "utilized the feminine to construct his rebellion against the strict categories of black identity and music". The musician later explained that he simply believed feminine men were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than masculine men.|$|E
500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.|$|E

[...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous.

500|$|Richard Johnson, under {{contract}} to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Devils. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told {{him to keep his}} eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also {{under contract}} with MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was [...] "a jerk", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine Film Review in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> [...] "This is the ironic part," [...] he said, [...] "it {{turned out to be one}} of my favourite films that I've been in!" ...|$|E
500|$|Reginald George Pollard {{was born}} on 20 January 1903 in Bathurst, New South Wales, the third son of Albert Edgar Pollard, an English accountant, and his Australian wife Thalia Rebecca, née McLean. Schooled in Bathurst, Reg entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1921, and {{graduated}} with the Sword of Honour for [...] "exemplary conduct and performance" [...] in 1924. Pollard and fellow graduate Frederick Scherger, winner of the King's Medal and future air chief marshal, applied to transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under a scheme designed to augment the RAAF's officer corps, but only Scherger was accepted. The previous year, Pollard and Scherger had inaugurated a Duntroon tradition when they found a horse's jawbone during a field exercise. Inspired by the Biblical tale in which Samson slays the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, they declared their find a lucky charm and brought {{it back to the}} college as a mascot; it became known as [...] "Enobesra" [...] (reportedly because [...] "jawbone seemed so commonplace, an arsebone sounded <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and spelt backwards sounded both mysterious and respectable").|$|E

With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E

Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E

[...] Additionally, Scar serves as a departure from previous Disney villains because they [...] "came off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister". Because Scar is the film's main antagonist, supervising animator Andreas Deja believed that [...] "villains work really well when they're subtle", explaining, [...] "to see them think and scheme and plot is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than showing them beating somebody up." [...] By blaming Mufasa's death on an innocent Simba, Scar ultimately triggers [...] "a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age." [...] The character's first line in The Lion King essentially summarizes the entire film, providing foreshadowing. It reads, [...] "Life's not fair is it? You see I-well, I... shall never be King. And you... shall never see light of another day," [...] subtly revealing the plot as well as [...] "the reason why [...] decides to murder his own brother." ...|$|E

Common Sense Media criticized Jasmine for lacking an {{original}} predicament and premise, while Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson described the character as a [...] "liberated" [...] but [...] "stiff" [...] heroine. Janet Maslin of The New York Times panned Jasmine: [...] "the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine... a nymph in harem pants, use words like 'fabulous' and 'amazing' to express unremarkable thoughts", concluding, [...] "Luckily, [...] surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than its supposed center." [...] Time Out called the character disappointing, and TV Guide described her as [...] "bland". Film critic Roger Ebert cited Jasmine among the film's weaknesses, dismissing the relationship between her and Aladdin as [...] "pale and routine" [...] in comparison to Belle and the Beast's. Additionally, Ebert wrote that the characters [...] "look unformed, as if even the filmmakers didn't see them as real individuals." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine derided the character as [...] "another 'free-spirited' type in the Barbie-doll tradition, a faux feminist who wants everyone {{to know that she}} can do everything the boys can". Orange Coasts Henry A. Giroux dismissed Jasmine as little more than [...] "an object of 's immediate desire" [...] and [...] "stepping stone to social mobility." ...|$|E
