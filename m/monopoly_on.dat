Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss.

50|$|In some cases, authors can {{be granted}} limited legal <b>monopolies</b> <b>on</b> {{the manner in}} which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as copyright, {{although}} the term intellectual property is used mistakenly in place of copyright. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of property upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, {{that may or may not}} carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from patent law in this respect: patents do grant <b>monopolies</b> <b>on</b> ideas (more on this below).|$|R
