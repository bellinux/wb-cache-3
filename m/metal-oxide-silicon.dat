By adopting a method of growing a layer of silicon dioxide {{on top of a}} silicon wafer, Atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. This is known as surface passivation, a critical step that made possible the ubiquity of silicon integrated circuits. Atalla then suggested that a field effect transistor - first envisioned in the 1920s and confirmed experimentally in the 1940s but not yet achieved -- be built of <b>metal-oxide-silicon.</b> Atalla assigned the task to Dawon Kahng, a scientist in his group.
