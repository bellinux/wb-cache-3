30|$|Regarding future works, new {{patterns}} can be elaborated {{and inserted}} into the computational support. With the realization of other case studies, improvements can be identified regarding functionality and usability of the computational support. An expected improvement is {{the extension of the}} pattern instantiation module, allowing the study of the incorporation of new values for the set of values suggested for the parameters, based on the new values provided by the stakeholders. Another extension is the development of patterns that meet non-functional requirements. More in-depth studies should be carried out so that non-functional requirements already specified by other authors can be reused. The inclusion of these non-functional requirements must occur in the computational support as well as the realization of controlled experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposal. Another intention is to implement a module for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications</b> of RDs and yet another for the realization of cost and time estimation {{for the development of the}} specified projects.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Risk ManagementSafety {{instrumented}} systems (SISs) {{are implemented}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry to detect the onset of hazardous events, and/or to mitigate their consequences. As with any system, for different reasons, modifications are necessary. If the modification is poorly executed, or if the risk is poorly understood, the modification may have undesired consequences. The main objective of this master thesis was to identify potential pitfalls that may result from poor change <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications,</b> and propose recommendations on how to handle these pitfalls. In addition to the main objective, two sub-objectives were supplemented to contribute to discussion and recommendations for the main objective. For the first sub-objective, a case was presented. The main purpose of this case was to illustrate how different modifications might affect the calculated PFD, and if the calculated values are sufficient to express the extent of the modification. As it became apparent in the discussion chapter, one cannot rely solely on the calculated PFD value. These values can provide useful insight for the decision maker; however, it is important to look beyond the assigned probabilities, since the probabilities may camouflage uncertainties. The circumstances should always be assessed in addition to the calculated PFD. The second sub-objective was to propose a simple alternative approach on how to classify the modifications to SIS in modification project. The main findings suggest that there is a need for an alternative description on what should be considered as minor and major modifications in SIS modification projects. This thesis proposes an alternative way of categorizing modifications, where four categories are used to express the safety significance of the modification. To aid in the categorization, a checklist consisting of several conditions (questions) is presented. The main purpose of this checklist is to provide an overview of the impact the proposed modification has on the system, and the risk level before the categorization. To cover the latent functional relationships, failure modes and impacts of modifications, the modification process should be well structured and documented. Several risk and safety assessments should be included as early as possible to ensure that potential problems are identified, and appropriate measures implemented as early as possible. This thesis proposes a management of change procedure in form of a flowchart. This flowchart is based on the identified issues and the requirements in the ISO- 9001 standard. The main purpose of the proposed procedure is to ensure that the modifications to SIS, or any other part of the facility are under control, and that the safety is not compromised. Furthermore, the procedure aids in providing traceability during, and after the modification process...|$|E

These highest centers, located in big cities, are considered the last referral points for the patients from nearby cities and states. As the incidents of rail and road accidents have increased in recent years, the role of EMS becomes critical in saving precious lives. But when the facilities and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> these emergency centers succumbs before the patient, then the question arises regarding the adequate availability and quality of EMS. The death of an unknown common man, Rambhor, for want of EMS in three big hospitals in the national capital of India put a big question on the "health" of the emergency health services in India. The emergency services infrastructure seems inadequate and quality and timely provision of EMS to critical patients appears unsatisfactory.

40|$|Background. There {{was limited}} {{published}} data on target organ damage (TOD) {{and the effect}} of nonadherence to practice guidelines in Ethiopia. This study determined TOD and the long term effect of nonadherence to clinical guidelines on hypertensive patients. Methods. An open level retrospective cohort study has been employed at cardiac clinic of Gondar university hospital for a mean follow-up period of 78 months. Multivariate Cox regression was conducted to test associating factors of TOD. Results. Of the total number of 612 patients examined, the overall prevalence of hypertensive TOD was 40. 3 %. The presence of comorbidities, COR = 1. 073 [1. 01 – 1. 437], AOR = 1. 196 [1. 174 – 1. 637], and nonadherence to clinical practice guidelines, COR = 1. 537 [1. 167 – 2. 024], AOR = 1. 636 [1. 189 – 2. 251], were found to be predicting factors for TOD.

40|$|Access Control is {{becoming}} increasingly important for today's ubiquitous systems. Sophisticated security requirements need to be ensured by authorization policies for increasingly complex and large applications. As a consequence, designers need to understand such policies and ensure that they meet the desired security constraints while administrators must also maintain them {{so as to comply}} with the evolving needs of systems and applications. These tasks are greatly complicated by the expressiveness and the dimensions of the authorization policies. It is thus necessary to provide policy designers and administrators with automated analysis techniques that are capable to foresee if, and under what conditions, security properties may be violated. For example, some analysis techniques have already been proposed in the literature for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC is a security model for access control that has been widely adopted in real-world applications. Although RBAC simplifies the design and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> policies, <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> RBAC policies in complex organizations are difficult and error prone activities due to the limited expressiveness of the basic RBAC model. For this reason, RBAC has been extended in several directions to accommodate various needs arising in the real world such as Administrative RBAC (ARBAC) and Temporal RBAC (TRBAC). This Dissertation presents our research efforts to find the best trade-off between scalability and expressiveness for the design and benchmarking of analysis techniques for authorization policies. We review the state-of-the-art of automated analysis for authorization policies, identify limitations of available techniques and then describe our approach that is based on recently developed symbolic model checking techniques based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving (for expressiveness) and carefully tuned heuristics (for scalability). Particularly, we present the implementation of the techniques on the automated analysis of ARBAC and ATRBAC policies and discuss extensive experiments that show that the proposed approach is superior to other state-of-the-art analysis techniques. Finally, we discuss directions for extensions...|$|R

Knee osteoarthritis is a common but often difficult problem to manage in primary care. Traditional nonsurgical <b>management,</b> consisting <b>of</b> lifestyle <b>modification,</b> physical therapy and pharmacologic therapy (e. g., analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications), is often ineffective or leaves residual symptoms. Viscosupplementation is a newly available option for patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis that involves a series of intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although increasing the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid appears to play a role. Clinical experience and studies of the two hyaluronic acid products available, hyaluronan and hylan G-F 20, are inconclusive but seem to indicate beneficial effects with minimal adverse reactions in a significant number of patients. The exact indications for viscosupplementation are still evolving, but it currently can be considered for use in patients who have significant residual symptoms despite traditional nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments.
