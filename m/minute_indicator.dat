40|$|The most {{important}} characteristic factor of cutting tools is cutting ability. One {{of the factors}} that influence cutting ability of cutting tools is wear resistance. At market there are many large selection of HSS tool steel with different type and merk. One of them was HSS tool steel made in Austria and Taiwan which share the same trade mark but have significant differences at price. The research aimed to compare HSS cutting tools quality made in Austria and Taiwan consider from wear, tool life and material structure aspect. This research had done by flank wear experiment to the HSS cutting tools. The specimens were BOHLER RAPID EXTRA 1200 with 3 / 8 x 4 ” on size made in Austria and Taiwan. The work piece specimen used ST 60 steel. Flank wear experiment of cutting tools had done by turning cutting tools to the work piece with four cutting speed variation like 19, 99 m/min, 25, 72 m/min, 26, 53 m/min and 30, 65 m/min that had given, then measured flank wear dimension (VB) using microscope that completed with dial indicator and pixel method. The result of this research showed that Austria HSS tool life which had the longest time at low cutting speed (Vc= 19, 99 m/min) was 100 <b>minute</b> (dial <b>indicator)</b> / 92, 5 minute (pixel), and tool life which had the shortest time at high cutting speed (Vc= 30, 65 m/min) was 25 <b>minute</b> (dial <b>indicator)</b> / 26, 5 minute (pixel). Taiwan HSS tool life which had the longest time at low cutting speed (Vc= 19, 99 m/min) was 87, 5 <b>minute</b> (dial <b>indicator)</b> / 84, 5 minute (pixel), and tool life which had the shortest time at high cutting speed (Vc= 30, 65 m/min) was 25 <b>minute</b> (dial <b>indicator)</b> / 22, 5 minute (pixel). The conclusion of this research is that HSS cutting tool made in Austria with more expensive cost, but has higher wear resistance and longer tool life than HSS cutting tool made in Taiwan. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many {{additional}} {{tasks in}} the Stat laboratory (SL) increase the workload. It {{is necessary to}} control them because they can affect the service provided by the laboratory. Our aim is to calculate these tasks, study their evolution over a 10 year period, and compare turnaround times (TAT) in summer period {{to the rest of}} the year. Materials and methods: Additional tasks were classified as “additional test request” and “additional sample”. We collected those incidences from the laboratory information system (LIS), and calculated their evolution over time. We also calculated the monthly TAT for troponin for Emergency department (ED) patients, as the difference between the verification and LIS registration time. A median time of 30 <b>minutes</b> was our <b>indicator</b> target. TAT results and tests workload in summer were compared {{to the rest of the}} year. Results: Over a 10 -year period, the technologists in the SL performed 51, 385 additional tasks, a median of 475 per month. The workload was significantly higher during the summer (45, 496 tests) than the rest of the year (44, 555 tests) (P = 0. 019). The troponin TAT did not show this variation between summer and the rest of the year, complying always with our 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>indicator</b> target. Conclusion: The technicians accomplished a significant number of additional tasks, and the workload kept increasing over the period of 10 years. That did not affect the TAT results...|$|R

Although respiratory rate and <b>minute</b> ventilation, <b>indicators</b> of hyperventilation, did not differ between groups, phobics paused more during inspiration than did controls. Phobics also showed more skin conductance fluctuations and less respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Self-reported anxiety was a more powerful discriminator than physiological measures, a result that may be partially explained by how phobics were selected. These results indicate that monitoring of multiple physiological systems outside the laboratory is practical and informative.

40|$|This study reports acute {{exercise}} {{responses in}} a large (N = 46) series of patients with McArdle disease and responses to exercise training in a smaller (n = 9) set of patients. Patients were studied during both incremental and steady-state cycle ergometer exercise, using cardiopulmonary testing, and the patients were compared with age- and gender-matched controls. The study was performed in a university setting (clinical exercise physiology laboratory). The 46 patients showed common features of McArdle disease. They were definitively diagnosed by histochemistry, biochemistry, and/or molecular genetic analysis. The 46 controls were healthy, sedentary individuals. Nine patients were studied before and after an 8 -month supervised aerobic exercise training program (including five weekly sessions of walking and/or cycling exercise with a duration no greater than 60 <b>minutes).</b> The main <b>indicators</b> of exercise capacity that we measured were peak power output, peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), and ventilatory threshold (VT). Exercise capacity (peak power output, 35 % control; VO 2 peak, 44 % control; VT, 66 % control) was markedly depressed in the patients. The patients who trained improved peak power output (25 %), VO 2 peak (44 %), and VT (27 %), with no evidence of negative outcomes from training. Although not achieving normal values, the response to training put the patients into the lower limit of normal controls. In conclusion, under carefully controlled conditions, patients with McArdle disease may perform acute exercise safely, and they may respond favorably to training.

40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the associations of parental socioeconomic status (SES) with preschoolers’ objectively measured sedentary time (SED) {{over the course of}} a week and with parent-reported children’s screen and reading times at home as indicators of sedentary behaviours (SB). Design Cross-sectional. Setting In years 2015 and 2016 in Finland. Participants 864 children, aged 3 – 6 years, with their parents. Outcome measures Children’s accelerometer data were transformed into average SED minutes per hour in different contexts (preschool, home during preschool days, weekend and total). Parent-reported children’s screen and reading times were expressed as average daily <b>minutes.</b> The SES <b>indicators</b> (maternal and paternal education and relative household income) were grouped into three categories. Linear or logistic regression analyses were used, with municipality, season, and children’s gender and age as covariates. CIs were adjusted for clustering at the preschool group level. Results Children with low maternal (β= 17. 21, 95 % CI: 8. 71 to 25. 71) and paternal (β= 10. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 77 to 20. 30) education had more overall screen time at home than their more advantaged counterparts. SES differences in overall screen time were mostly explained by TV viewing. Children with low as opposed to high maternal education (β=− 2. 66, 95 % CI: − 4. 95 to – 0. 38) had less reading time at home. Children whose fathers were on the middle (β=− 1. 15, 95 % CI: − 2. 01 to – 0. 29) educational level had less weekend SED than those with high paternal education. Otherwise, parental SES was not related to objectively measured SED. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the fact that the associations between parental SES and preschoolers’ SB are dependent on the indicators of SES and SBs, and vary between different contexts. Generally, parental SES was not associated with SED, whereas some SES differences existed in screen time and reading time at home. Interventions aiming to diminish SES differences in children’s SB should focus on home hours. Trial registration number ISRCTN 57165350...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood anatomy of 35 collections representing 22 Old World species of Ephedra; {{the survey of}} bark and pith anatomy is based {{on some of these}} species. Character-state ranges {{similar to those of the}} New World species are reported, although more numerous species show vessel absence in latewood. Little diminution in vessel diameter or density occurs in latewood of the eight species that are scandant or sprawling. Helical thickenings or sculpture occur in vessels of about a third of the Old World species, but these thickenings are clearly related to pits, often not very prominent, and rarely present in tracheids (alternative expressions characterize helical thickenings in the New World species). Helical thickenings are statistically correlated to xeromorphic wood features such as narrower vessels and fewer vessels per mm 2 of transection. Paucity of vessels is an indicator ofxeromorphy (rather than abundance, as in dicotyledons) because tracheids, which have optimal conductive safety, are present instead of vessels. Near vessellessness is reported for E. distachya var. monostachya, E. gerardiana, and E. monosperma. A high degree of wood xeromorphy characterizes species of the highlands of Central Asia and the Middle East, where extremes of drought and cold prevail. A close approach to storied structure is reported in three species. Procumbent ray cells, absent at first, are produced as stems increase in diameter.

Examining smoking behaviors among occupational groups with a high prevalence of women may reveal the culture of smoking behavior and quit efforts of female smokers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how smoking and quitting characteristics (i. e., ever and recent quit attempts) among females in the occupation of nursing are similar or different to those of women in the general population. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey 2006 / 2007 were used to compare smoking behaviors of nurses (n = 2, 566) to those of non-healthcare professional women (n = 93, 717). Smoking characteristics included years of smoking, number of cigarettes, and time to first cigarette with smoking within the first 30 <b>minutes</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of nicotine dependence. Logistic regression models using replicate weights were used to determine correlates of ever and previous 12 months quit attempts. Results Nurses had a lower smoking prevalence than other women (12. 1 % vs 16. 6 %, p < 0. 0001); were more likely to have ever made a quit attempt (77 % vs 68 %, p = 0. 0002); but not in the previous 12 months (42 % vs 43 %, p = 0. 77). Among those who ever made a quit attempt, nurses who smoked within 30 minutes of waking, were more likely to have made a quit attempt compared to other women (OR = 3. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 9, 5. 1). When considering quit attempts within the last 12 months, nurses whose first cigarette was after 30 minutes of waking were less likely to have made a quit attempt compared to other females (OR = 0. 69, 95 % CI: 0. 49, 0. 98). There were no other significant differences in ever/recent quitting. Conclusions Smoking prevalence among female nurses was lower than among women who were not in healthcare occupations, as expected. The lack of difference in recent quit efforts among female nurses as compared to other female smokers has not been previously reported. The link between lower level of nicotine dependence, as reflected by the longer time to first cigarette, and lower quit attempts among nurses needs further exploration...|$|R

Carrots (Daucus carota L.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} root vegetables for their nutrient content. However, carrots are seasonal in nature and to extend their shelf-life, industrial processing (dehydration, freezing, etc) is usually carried out. Conventional blanching is one of the most commonly used pretreatments prior to processing because of their ability to deactivate the enzymes (peroxidase (POD), pectinmethylesterase (PME)) responsible for carrot quality deterioration. However, blanching, depending on the conditions, can negatively affect the quality of carrots. Thus, losses of nutrient such as sugars, polyphenols, vitamins, etc may take place due to leaching and heat-induced changes derived from the initial stages of the Maillard reaction. In this sense, alternative blanching methods such as sonication have been described to be advantageous in the case of mushrooms and cauliflower. In addition, the increasing consumer's demand of premium quality products has promoted the study of different quality indicators in blanched processed vegetables. In spite of all these papers, no works on the application of ultrasound for carrot blanching have been carried out. The present study was undertaken to optimize the operating conditions (temperature, time and ultrasonic power) in the ultrasonic (US) blanching of carrots to preserve their nutritional and functional properties. Selected conditions were chosen on the basis of the evaluation of different quality parameters (carbohydrates, 2 -furoymethyl lysine, polyphenols). Comparison with conventional blanching was also studied. Optimization of sonication process included the study of different sample geometries (slices of 2 and 4 mm thickness) and blanching equipments: ultrasonic probe (BRANSON) operating at 0. 26 W/cm 3 and 0. 13 W/cm 3 : 15, 30 and 60 minutes and ultrasonic bath (SONICA EP 2200) operating at 0. 04 W/cm 3 : 40 and 60 °C, 30 and 60 minutes, were tested. For comparison purposes, the conventional blanching conditions were: 60 °C, 40 minutes; 95 °C, 5 minutes; boiling, 1 minute; steam, 2 <b>minutes.</b> The quality <b>indicators</b> evaluated were: deactivation of POD and PME determined by colorimetric and titrimetric methods respectively; carbohydrate content by GC-FID; concentration of 2 -furoylmethyl lysine quantified by ion-pair RP-HPLC; antioxidant activity determined by the ORAC method and total polyphenol content determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method. US bath did not show differences over enzymatic deactivation and the different quality indicators evaluated. On the contrary, ultrasound probe had an important effect over enzymes. Losses of nutrients (polyphenols and carbohydrates) were very important in conventional blanching and minor when ultrasound probe or steam blanching were the selected treatments. These results seem to indicate the usefulness of ultrasonic probe as an effective method for enzymatic inactivation with minor changes in carrot quality.
