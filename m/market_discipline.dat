50|$|<b>Market</b> <b>discipline</b> is a {{topic of}} {{particular}} concern because of banking deposit insurance laws. Most governments offer deposit insurance for people making deposits with banks. Normally, bank managers have strong incentives to avoid risky loans and other investments. However, mandated deposit insurance eliminates much of the risk to bankers. This constitutes a loss of <b>market</b> <b>discipline.</b> In order to counteract this loss of <b>market</b> <b>discipline,</b> governments introduce regulations aimed at preventing bank managers from taking excessive risk. Today <b>market</b> <b>discipline</b> is introduced into the Basel II Capital Accord as a pillar of prudential banking regulation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the role of}} <b>market</b> <b>disciplines</b> in the financial sector. It is a slightly amended version of a paper prepared recently {{under the auspices of}} the APEC Finance Ministers' forum, summarising the key points to emerge from an APEC conference on <b>market</b> <b>disciplines</b> and the role they can play in promoting financial stability. <b>Market</b> <b>disciplines</b> are an important element in promoting sound and efficient financial systems. In a well-functioning market, financial institutions with poorly developed risk management structures tend to be penalised by the market through higher funding costs, while those with prudent risk management structures tend to be rewarded. In the longer term, weaker financial institutions will be weeded from the system, leading to a healthier and more dynamic financial system that is better able to meet the needs of the wider economy. Unfortunately, many government interventions and policies tend to impede the effectiveness of <b>market</b> <b>disciplines,</b> such as widespread government ownership of banks, government guarantees of bank deposits, a presumption that insolvent banks will be rescued by the government, and poorly functioning financial <b>markets.</b> Weak <b>market</b> <b>disciplines</b> have been a major cause of financial crises in recent years in many countries, resulting in severe economic and social costs. This article {{discusses the}}se issues and assesses the types of policies required to strengthen <b>market</b> <b>disciplines.</b> It also discusses the need to strike a sensible balance between promoting effective <b>market</b> <b>disciplines</b> on the one hand, while seeking to avoid the dangers associated with market over -reaction or extreme market volatility, on the other. ...|$|R

It must be consistent with how the senior management, including the board, assess and manage the risks of the institution.|$|E

As a result, new substantive knowledge {{was added to the}} <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> - including such ideas as opinion leadership, reference groups and brand loyalty. Market segmentation, especially demographic segmentation based on socioeconomic status (SES) index and household life-cycle, also became fashionable. With the addition of consumer behaviour, the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> exhibited increasing scientific sophistication with respect to theory development and testing procedures.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{information}} search and retrieval, key word searches are typically used for information search and retrieval (Flynn, 1987). Unfortunately, an information overload problem frequently occurs when hundreds of citations appear on the screen. This problem is especially acute in Marketing, in which many diversified areas of the Social Sciences (such as psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Statistics, Economics and Mathematical Programming) have applications in Marketing. In this paper, we suggest a technique {{that will allow the}} researcher to initially limit the information search and retrieval to a specific number of journals that, by virtue of their content, are oriented toward a specific subarea of the <b>Marketing</b> <b>Discipline.</b> This approach can be applied to other disciplines as well. Since the problem of information overload is especially true in the <b>Marketing</b> <b>discipline,</b> therefore, the focus of this paper is on Marketing Journals.

50|$|The {{efficacy}} of regulations aimed at introducing <b>market</b> <b>discipline</b> is questionable. Financial bailouts provide implicit insurance schemes like too-big-to-fail, where regulators in central agencies {{feel obliged to}} rescue a troubled bank for fear of financial contagion. It {{can be argued that}} depositors would not bother to monitor bank activities under these favorable circumstances.There are numerous academic studies on this subject. The findings, at first, had mixed and somewhat discouraging results where <b>market</b> <b>discipline</b> {{did not appear to be}} an essential feature in banking. Later studies, though, when including some of the previously missing key aspects into the empirical analysis, supported the existence and significance of such a natural control mechanism unambiguously. Accordingly, depositors 'discipline' bank activities to some extent depending on the well functioning of financial markets and institutions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Market {{orientation}} (MO) is at {{the center}} of the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> and has been the focus of one of the longest and richest research efforts in the field. This paper aims to study the development of the MO research area and changes in its nature, and the implications these have for MO research in particular as well as for the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> as a whole. Design/methodology/approach: The study is guided by sociology of science research and studies of the history of the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline.</b> It is based on a review of all MO articles and references in the period 1957 - 2005. Findings: The findings reveal three periods in the development of MO research: 1950 s-late 1970 s, late 1970 s-early 1990 s, and early 1990 s until today. In terms of diffusion over time, MO research has diffused from marketing mostly to management, from generalist to specialist journals, from higher to lower quality journals, and from the USA only to Europe. Over time more scholars have become involved in MO research and the number of co-authored MO articles has increased. The paper also finds that the MO research knowledge base and impact continue to be limited to marketing and management. Research limitations/implications: While the study involves a large effort to collect longitudinal data on MO publication activity, its main limitation is its descriptive nature. Originality/value: Unlike previous research in marketing that has typically studied articles, authors and reference data to gain insight into the intellectual developments of specific marketing journals, here the authors use these sources for studying the structure and evolution of a specific and important research area such as MO. Also, the study is based on rich and longitudinal data, enabling a variety of longitudinal analyses. The link between the MO area and the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> is of value, showing how the development of MO mirrors key developments in the <b>marketing</b> <b>discipline</b> at large and is influenced by many of the same forces that shape the discipline...|$|R
