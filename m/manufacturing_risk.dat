Assembly of composite structures typically means bolting or riveting and this in turn means that geometric accuracy is a dominating factor besides the bare laminate properties. Integral structures like the ALCAS CFRP Door Surround Structure (DSS) are advantageous be-cause they minimise joining activities and {{reduce the number of}} critical interfaces. On the other side highly integral structures have the tendency to increase the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>risk</b> because every small local flaw can ruin the complete structural component. The way ahead within the ALCAS project was to generate a variety of possible options and than challenge these options by considering the crucial boundary conditions given within the project. The major steps in the project were the definition of the global design approach, the development of an appropriate preforming concept, the definition of suitable primary and secondary moulds and last not least the set-up of a mature resin infusion curing and demoulding strategy. To analyse the result the structure was mounted on a typical fuselage skin and was successfully tested under representative boundary conditions. The conclusion is, that today even ambitious concepts can be realised with composite structures to demonstrate the feasibility of both design and manufacturing strategies. To achieve a fully competi-tive low cost high performance CFRP structure, it is most important to link all disciplines together, beginning with systems engineering to stress and design up to production and also certification. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores risk {{management}} practices in global manufacturing investment. It reflects the growing internationalisation of manufacturing {{and the increasing}} complexity and fragmentation of manufacturing systems. Issues of {{risk management}} have become increasingly important in financial and company governance contexts not least because of growing international concerns {{about the consequences of}} unregulated risk. However while significant {{progress has been made in}} the awareness and articulation of financial risk there appeared to be little evidence of systematic management of risks associated with the globalisation of manufacturing despite the fact that ill-advised internationalisation projects could risk companies' futures. Investment risk management practice has evolved as risk analysis in global manufacturing investment from theoretical and practice perspectives. The need to actively manage risk has tended to be lost by the adoption of complex financial risk analysis methods in industrial investment projects. The approach adopted in this research was to undertake detailed case investigations in a cross section of industrial businesses at different levels of maturity in order to observe current practices, identify common principles and to seek to synthesise systematic approaches to risk management where appropriate. These field studies were conducted against a background of a detailed review of the literature and practice in finance and consulting and a detailed review of literature and practice in manufacturing strategy and system design. The key findings are as follows: (i) Elements of global <b>manufacturing</b> <b>risk</b> are managed by a variety of implicit and explicit methods, typically embedded in strategic and financial evaluations. There are no widely recognised comprehensive and systematic approaches to the analysis and mitigation of risks associated with global manufacturing investments. (ii) A broad review and analysis of global manufacturing investment projects identified key categories of investment risks and key dimensions of investment risk management. (iii) A very preliminary classification of global manufacturers from an investment risk management practice perspective, which may be helpful to companies in assessing their own risk management capabilities and behaviours. (iv) A prototype investment risk management process architecture is proposed based upon the key research findings. It presents a structured approach to the key risk management tasks and demonstrates their generality across a range of industrial environment. This provides confidence though not conclusive evidence that these methods might be applicable across a broad spectrum of manufacturing industries. The research findings extend the current understanding of risk management into the domain of global manufacturing strategy and provide the basis for more comprehensive and systematic assessment of risk in global investment projects. Further research will be required to validate the proposed risk management process and to explore the particular risks associated with different sectors, technologies, and business contexts.

The Integral Airframe Structures (IAS) Program identified a feasible integrally stiffened fuselage concept and evaluated performance and manufacturing cost compared to conventional designs. An integral skin/stiffener concept was produced both by plate hog-out and near-net extrusion. Alloys evaluated included 7050 -T 7451 plate, 7050 -T 74511 extrusion, 6013 -T 6511 extrusion, and 7475 -T 7351 plate.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the approaches and methods selected in fabrication of a carbon composite demonstration {{structure for the}} Composite Crew Module (CCM) Program. The program is managed by the NASA Safety and Engineering Center with participants from ten NASA Centers and AFRL. Multiple aerospace contractors are participating in the design development, tooling and fabrication effort as well. The goal {{of the program is}} to develop an agency wide design team for composite habitable spacecraft. The specific goals for this development project are: a). To gain hands on experience in design, building and testing a composite crew module. b) To validate key assumptions by resolving composite spacecraft design details through fabrication and testing of hardware. This abstract is based on Preliminary Design data [...] The final design will continue to evolve through the fall of 2007 with fabrication mostly completed by conference date. From a structures perspective, the. CCM {{can be viewed as a}} pressure module with variable pressure time histories and a series of both impact and quasi-static, high intensity point, line, and area distributed loads. The portion of the overall space vehicle being designed and. fabricated by the CCM team is just the pressure module and primary loading points. The heaviest point loads are applied and distributed to the pressure module at. an aluminum Service Module/Alternate Launch Abort System (SM/ALAS) fittings and at Main and Drogue Chute fittings. Significant line loads with metal to metal impact is applied at. the Lids ring. These major external point and line loads as well as pressure impact loads (blast and water landing) are applied to the lobed floor though the reentry shield and crushable materials. The pressure module is divided into upper and lower. shells that mate together with a bonded belly band splice joint to create the completed structural assembly. The benefits of a split CCM far outweigh the risks of a joint. These benefits include lower tooling cost and less <b>manufacturing</b> <b>risk.</b> Assembly of the top and bottom halves of the pressure shell will allow access to the interior of the shell throughout remaining fabrication sequence and can also potentially permit extensive installation of equipment and. crew facilities prior to final assembly of the two shell halves. A Pi pre-form is a woven carbon composite material which is provided in pre-impregnated form and frozen for long term storage. The cross-section shape allows the top of the pi to be bonded to a flat or curved surface with a second flat plate composite section bonded between two upstanding legs of the Pi. One of the regions relying on the merits of the Pi pre-form is the backbone. All connections among plates of the backbone structure, including the upper flanges, and to the lobe base of the pressure shell are currently joined by Pi pre-forms. The intersection of backbone composite plates is formed by application of two Pi pre-forms, top flanges and lobed surfaces are bonded with one Pi pre-form. The process of applying the pre-impregnated pi-preform will be demonstrated to include important steps like surface preparation, forming, application of pressure dams, vacuum bagging for consolidation, and curing techniques. Chopped carbon fiber tooling was selected over other traditional metallic and carbon fiber tooling. The requirement of schedule and cost economy for a moderate reuse cure tool warranted composite tooling options. Composite tooling schedule duration of 18 weeks compared favorably against other metallic tooling including invar tooling. Composite tooling also shows significant cost savings over low CTE metallic options. The composite tooling options were divided into two groups and the final decision was based on the cost, schedule, tolerance, temperature, and reuse requirements...|$|E
