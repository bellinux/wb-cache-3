25|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> size {{is such that}} there is an inverse relationship between the number of motor units and the force each generates (i.e., the number of muscle fibers per <b>motor</b> <b>unit).</b> Thus, there are many small motor units and progressively fewer larger motor units. This means that at low levels of recruitment, the force increment due to recruitment is small, whereas in forceful contractions, the force increment becomes much larger. Thus the ratio between the force increment produced by adding another <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> and the force threshold at which that unit is recruited remains relatively constant.|$|E
25|$|In SPS patients, <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> neurons fire involuntarily in a {{way that}} resembles a normal contraction. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{potentials}} fire while the patient is at rest, particularly in the stiff muscles. The excessive firing of motor neurons may be caused by malfunctions in spinal and supra-segmental inhibitory networks that utilize GABA. Involuntary actions show up as voluntary on EMG scans; even when the patient tries to relax, there are agonist and antagonist contractions.|$|E

40|$|During {{fatiguing}} contractions, many {{adjustments in}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> behaviour occur: decrease in muscle fibre conduction velocity; increase in <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> synchronisation; modulation of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> firing rate; increase in variability of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> inter-spike interval. We simulated {{the influence of}} all these adjustments on synthetic EMG signals in isometric/isotonic conditions. The fractal dimension of the EMG signal was found mainly influenced by <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> firing behaviour, being affected by both firing rate and synchronisation level, and least affected by muscle fibre conduction velocity. None of the calculated EMG indices was able to discriminate between firing rate and <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> synchronisation...|$|R
40|$|Virtually all {{movements}} {{involve the}} recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from multiple muscles. Given the functional diversity of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (motoneurons and the muscle fibers they supply), the effective production of specific movements undoubtedly depends upon some principle(s) to organize the ensemble of active <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The principle acting to organize {{the recruitment of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within muscles is the size principle, whereby the first <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to be recruited have the smallest values for axonal conduction velocity and contractile force, and are the slowest to contract and fatigue. Here we {{consider the possibility that}} the size principle applies in the recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> across muscles, i. e., that regardless of their muscles of origin, active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> are recruited in rank order, for example, from low to high conduction velocity. The benefits of orderly recruitment across muscles could be similar to the acknowledged advantages of orderly recruitment within muscles. One benefit is that the neural process involved in organizing active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> would be simplified. In a muscle-based scheme, the size principle would organize only those <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within individual muscles, leaving the nervous system with the additional task of coordinating the relative activities of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from different muscles. By contrast, in an ensemble-based scheme, orderly recruitment of all <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> according to the size principle would automatically coordinate <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> both within and across motor nuclei. Another potential benefit is the provision for movements with smooth trajectory, the result of interleaving the divergent torque contributions made by <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from muscles that differ in their orientations about joints. Otherwise, if order were restricted within muscles, the torque trajectory of a joint would change unevenly as participating muscles begin contracting at different times and grade activity at different rates. These considerations support speculation that <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recruited from co-contracting muscles are collectively recruited according to the size principle...|$|R
50|$|During an {{activity}} of lifting heavy {{objects such as}} working out with a dumbbell, not only does low-threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> but also the high threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> are recruited to compensate forces required in addition to just holding a fork, in which the energy created by the low threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> is sufficient to complete the job. When giving a job, the body first recruits the slow-twitch <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> following by recruit more a more fast-twitch <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> as forces required to complete the movements increase. Thus, when the body has to carry an extremely massive object, it would recruited all the available <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to contract for the particular muscle that has been used.|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of antibodies against GAD {{is the best}} indication of the condition that can be detected by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Anti-GAD65 is found in about 80 percent of SPS patients. Anti-thyroid, anti-intrinsic factor, anti-nuclear, anti-RNP, and anti-gliadin are also often present in blood tests. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrates involuntary <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firing in SPS patients. EMG can confirm the diagnosis by noting spasms in distant muscles {{as a result of}} subnoxious stimulation of cutaneous or mixed nerves. Responsiveness to diazepam helps confirm that the patient is suffering from SPS, as this decreases stiffness and <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potential firing.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method is}} sought to accurately quantify {{the number of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> that operate a working muscle. Measurements of a muscle’s contractive potential are obtained by administering a sequence of electrical stimuli. However, the firing patterns of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> are non-deterministic and therefore estimating their number is non-trivial. We consider a state-space model that assumes a fixed number of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to describe the hidden processes within the body.

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{the normal}} order of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{recruitment}} may be altered, such that small motor units cease to fire and larger ones may be recruited. This {{is thought to}} be due to the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory motoneuronal inputs.|$|E

25|$|Electrodiagnostic testing {{can help}} {{distinguish}} myopathies from neuropathies, {{which can help}} determine the course of further work-up. Most of the electrodiagnostic abnormalities seen in myopathies are also seen in neuropathies (nerve disorders). Electrodiagnostic abnormalities common to myopathies and neuropathies include; abnormal spontaneous activity (e.g., fibrillations, positive sharp waves, etc.) on needle EMG and, small amplitudes of the motor responses compound muscle action potential, or CMAP during nerve conduction studies. Many neuropathies, however, cause abnormalities of sensory nerve studies, whereas myopathies involve only the muscle, with normal sensory nerves. The most important factor distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy on needle EMG is the careful analysis of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> action potential (MUAP) size, shape, and recruitment pattern.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{innervation}} {{and organization of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the brachioradialis muscle of 25 normal human subjects. We recorded intramuscular EMG signals at points separated by 15 mm along the proximodistal muscle axis during moderate isometric contractions, identified from 27 to 61 (mean 39) individual <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> per subject using EMG decomposition, and estimated {{the locations of the}} endplates and distal muscle/tendon junctions from the motor-unit action potential (MUAP) propagation patterns and terminal standing waves. In three subjects all the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were innervated in a single endplate zone. In the other 22 subjects, the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were innervated in 3 – 6 (mean 4) distinct endplate zones separated by 15 – 55 mm along the proximodistal axis. One-third of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> had fibers innervated in more than one zone. The more distally innervated <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> had distinct terminal waves indicating tendonous termination, while the more proximal <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> lacked terminal waves, indicating intrafascicular termination. Analysis of blocked MUAP components revealed that 19 % of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> had at least one doubly innervated fiber, i. e., a fiber innervated in two different endplate zones by two different motoneurons, and thus belonging to two different <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> These results are consistent with the brachioradialis muscle having a series-fibered architecture consisting of multiple, overlapping bands of muscle fibers in most individuals and a simple parallel-fibered architecture in some individuals...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{evidence}} suggests the fibers of different <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> reside within distinct vastus medialis (VM) regions. It remains unknown whether {{the activity of}} these <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> may be modulated differently. Herein we assess the discharge rate of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> detected proximodistally from the VM to address this issue. Methods: Surface electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded proximally and distally from the VM while 10 healthy subjects performed isometric contractions. Single <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were decomposed from surface EMGs. The smoothed discharge rates of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> identified from the same and from different VM regions were then cross-correlated. Results: During low-level contractions, the discharge rate varied more similarly for distal (cross-correlation peak; interquartile interval: 0. 27 - 0. 40) and proximal (0. 28 - 0. 52) than for proximodistal pairs of VM <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (0. 20 - 0. 33; P = 0. 006). Conclusions: The discharge rates of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from different proximodistal VM regions show less similarity in their variations than those of pairs of units either distally or proximally...|$|R
2500|$|A <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} of one motor neuron {{and all of}} the muscle fibers it stimulates. [...] All muscles consist of a number of motor units and the fibers belonging to a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> are dispersed and intermingle amongst fibers of other units. The muscle fibers belonging to one <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> can be spread throughout part, or most of the entire muscle, depending on the number of fibers and size of the muscle. When a motor neuron is activated, all of the muscle fibers innervated by the motor neuron are stimulated and contract.|$|E
2500|$|The force {{produced}} by a single <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> is determined {{in part by the}} number of muscle fibers in the unit. Another important determinant of force is the frequency with which the muscle fibers are stimulated by their innervating axon.

Generally, [...] this allows a 2 to 4-fold change in force. In general, the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firing rate of each individual <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> increases with increasing muscular effort until a maximum rate is reached.

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> per muscle can change due to aging, disease, or injury. These {{techniques}} {{are used to}} diagnose disease or monitor the effects of aging, disease and injury over time.In neuropathies, motoneurons die off, {{reducing the number of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> progressively. In myopathies the size of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> is reduced because of the death of motor fibres, but the number of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> remains the same until the disease progresses to a very severe state.

50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>units</b> are {{organized}} slightly differently in invertebrates; each muscle has few <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (typically less than 10), and each muscle fiber is innervated by multiple neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

2500|$|The {{activation}} of one motor neuron {{will result in}} a weak but distributed muscle contraction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the {{contractile}} properties of single <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the intrinsic (short) and extrinsic (long) finger muscles in awake human subjects using intraneural motor axon stimulation. Twitch properties were measured for 17 intrinsic and 11 extrinsic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> by selective stimulation of a single motor axon in the ulnar or the median nerve. Force was measured from the appropriate digit, just distal to the muscle's point of insertion and single unit EMG was recorded with surface electrodes. Force-frequency relationships (2 - 100 Hz) were established for 16 of these units (7 intrinsic, 9 extrinsic). Across the 16 <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> for which force-frequency data were obtained, twitch contraction time (63. 7 ± 6. 0 ms, mean ±s. e. m.) was inversely correlated with the frequency required to generate half-maximum tetanic force (12. 0 ± 1. 1 Hz). We found no systematic differences between the contractile properties of intrinsic and extrinsic <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> There was no evidence of a bimodal distribution into large/small or fast/slow units based on maximum force or contraction times, although both fast and slow <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were encountered. The peak slope of the sigmoidal force-frequency relationship for intrinsic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (9. 1 and 4. 4 - 12. 9 mN Hz− 1, median and interquartile range) was significantly higher than that for extrinsic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (2. 9 and 2. 3 - 3. 1 mN Hz− 1; P= 0. 028), i. e. greater force steps were produced by the intrinsic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> for a given change in stimulation frequency. This difference suggests that <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the intrinsic muscles of the hand are more sensitive to modulating force output by changes in motoneurone firing rates than are those in the extrinsic muscles.
