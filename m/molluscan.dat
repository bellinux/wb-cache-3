5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining <b>molluscan</b> classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and {{it can only be}} made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were monophyletic, demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the <b>molluscan</b> phylogeny, and since the methods used to determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is risky to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal <b>molluscan</b> relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of <b>molluscan</b> anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>molluscan</b> shell {{appears to}} have {{originated}} from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of <b>molluscan</b> reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} <b>molluscan</b> {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; <b>molluscan,</b> like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Except for nautiloids (represented by {{the modern}} order Nautilida) and coleoids (which had already diverged into modern octopodes, squids, and cuttlefish) all {{other species of}} the <b>molluscan</b> class Cephalopoda became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These {{included}} the ecologically significant belemnoids, {{as well as the}} ammonoids, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.|$|E

25|$|Publication of the decades-long Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology is a work-in-progress; and {{therefore}} {{it is not yet}} complete: For example, there is no volume yet published regarding the post-Paleozoic era caenogastropods (a <b>molluscan</b> group including the whelk and periwinkle). Furthermore, every so often, previously published volumes of the Treatise are revised.|$|E
25|$|Cephalopods became {{dominant}} {{during the}} Ordovician period, represented by primitive nautiloids. The class now contains two, only distantly related, extant subclasses: Coleoidea, which includes octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish; and Nautiloidea, represented by Nautilus and Allonautilus. In the Coleoidea, the <b>molluscan</b> shell has been internalized or is absent, {{whereas in the}} Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living species of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonoidea (ammonites) and Belemnoidea (belemnites).|$|E
25|$|During his lifetime, Lamarck named a {{large number}} of species, many of which have become synonyms. The World Register of Marine Species gives no fewer than 1,634 records.

The geological group consists primarily of sedimentary layers of loose sand, and secondarily of clay silt and pebbly-sand layers. Above the Shimōsa Group are more recent rich, fertile layers of volcanic ash. The Shimōsa Plateau yields great deposits of fossils, notably <b>molluscan</b> fossils, as the plateau was originally submerged under water.|$|E
25|$|While the {{importance}} of maximum shell size {{and its role in}} the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World Record Size Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled <b>molluscan</b> species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World Record Size Shells.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{structure}} of MTs is also highly heterogeneous. While vertebrate, echinoderm and crustacean MTs show a bidominial structure with divalent metals as Zn(II) or Cd(II) (the protein is folded {{so as to}} bind metals in two functionally independent domains, with a metallic cluster each), yeast and procariotyc MTs show a monodominial structure (one domain with a single metallic cluster). Although no structural data is available for <b>molluscan,</b> nematoda and Drosophila MTs, it is commonly assumed that the former are bidominial and the latter monodominial. No conclusive data are available for Plant MTs, but two possible structures have been proposed: 1) a bidominial structure {{similar to that of}} vertebrate MTs; 2) a codominial structure, in which two Cys-rich domains interact to form a single metallic cluster.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is a predatory fish, taking {{a variety of}} {{crustaceans}} and other small prey items, with its exact diet varying both spatially and temporally. In northern Australia the most common prey items are ostracods, gastropods and euphausiids. The diet of individuals in India is more varied, with crustaceans, notably decapods and copepods making up {{the main part of}} the diet. Small fishes of the genus Anchoviella, pteropods, algal material, diatoms, <b>molluscan</b> larvae and foramanifera make up a lesser part of the diet here also. The species shows some diet partitioning between size classes, and during the year, the diet shifts as prey items vary in abundance. The species is diurnally active in India, while elsewhere in its range, nocturnal feeding has been reported. Unlike some of its relatives, feeding continues during spawning, with no apparent change in food preferences.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and <b>molluscan</b> genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

500|$|There {{is an even}} sharper {{debate about}} whether Wiwaxia, from about , was a mollusc, and much of this centers on whether its feeding {{apparatus}} was a type of radula or more {{similar to that of}} some polychaete worms. Nicholas Butterfield, who opposes the idea that Wiwaxia was a mollusc, has written that earlier microfossils from [...] are fragments of a genuinely mollusc-like radula. This appears to contradict the concept that the ancestral <b>molluscan</b> radula was mineralized.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlin studied {{not only}} {{arthropods}} but soft-bodied invertebrates as well. He described over 100 new species and 22 new genera of polychaete worms in a two-volume work {{considered one of}} the [...] "great monuments" [...] in annelid taxonomy by {{the former director of the}} Hopkins Marine Station, and published on Utah's <b>molluscan</b> fauna. He was section editor on sipunculids as well as myriapods for the academic journal database Biological Abstracts. William Behle has noted he also made indirect contributions to ornithology, including leading several multi-day specimen collecting trips and guiding the graduate research of Stephen Durrant, who worked on Utah game birds, and Behle himself, who studied nesting birds of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
500|$|The {{main body}} cavity is a hemocoel through which blood circulates; their circulatory systems are mainly open. The [...] "generalized" [...] mollusc's feeding system {{consists}} of a rasping [...] "tongue", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered [...] "hairs" [...] called cilia play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of <b>molluscan</b> reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults.|$|E
500|$|So far Kimberella fossils show {{no sign of}} a radula, the toothed chitinous [...] "tongue" [...] that is the {{diagnostic}} feature of modern molluscs, excluding bivalves. Since radulae are very rarely preserved in fossil molluscs, its absence {{does not necessarily mean that}} K. quadrata did not have one. The rocks in the immediate vicinity of Kimberella fossils bear scratch marks that have been compared to those made by the radulae of molluscs as they graze on microbial mats. These traces, named Radulichnus and Kimberichnus, have been interpreted as circumstantial evidence for the presence of a radula. In conjunction with the univalve shell, this has been taken to indicate Kimberella was a mollusc or very closely related to molluscs. In 2001 and 2007 Fedonkin suggested that the feeding mechanism might be a retractable proboscis with hook-like organs at its end. Kimberella′s feeding apparatus appears to differ significantly from the typical mollusc radula, and this demonstrates that Kimberella is at best a stem-group mollusc. [...] Notably, the scratch marks indicate that the 'teeth' were dragged towards the organism, not pushed away as in molluscs, and that the maximum impact on the sediment was when the mouthpart was furthest from the organism. [...] The direction of grazing is also backwards, as opposed to forwards as in molluscs. [...] Furthermore, the constant width of grooves implies stereoglossy – a trait that is very derived in molluscs. It has been argued that the shape of the feeding traces is incompatible with a radula, and that despite the <b>molluscan</b> body form, the lack of a radula places Kimberella well outside the <b>molluscan</b> crown group. [...] Butterfield points out that plenty of other groups of organisms bear structures capable of making similar marks.|$|E
500|$|Bivalvia, in {{previous}} centuries {{referred to as}} the Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda, is a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts. [...] Bivalves as a group have no head and they lack some usual <b>molluscan</b> organs like the radula and the odontophore. They include the clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, {{as well as a number}} of families that live in freshwater. The majority are filter feeders. The gills have evolved into ctenidia, specialised organs for feeding and breathing. Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some bivalves, such as the scallops and file shells, can swim. The shipworms bore into wood, clay, or stone and live inside these substances.|$|E
500|$|The {{most basic}} <b>molluscan</b> larva is a trochophore, which is planktonic and feeds on {{floating}} food particles {{by using the}} two bands of cilia around its [...] "equator" [...] to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of mesoderm in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a veliger stage in which the prototroch, the [...] "equatorial" [...] band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the velum ("veil"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and metamorphoses into the adult form. While metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.|$|E
