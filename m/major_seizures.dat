40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} audio-based detection of <b>major</b> <b>seizures</b> (tonic–clonic and long generalized tonic) in adult patients with intellectual disability living in an institute for residential care. MethodsFirst, we checked in a random sample (n= 17, 102 <b>major</b> <b>seizures)</b> how many patients have recognizable sounds during these seizures. In {{the second part of}} this trial, we followed 10 patients (who had <b>major</b> <b>seizures</b> with recognizable sounds) during four weeks with an acoustic monitoring system developed by CLB (‘CLB-monitor’) and video camera. In week 1, we adapted the sound detection threshold until, per night, a maximum of 20 sounds was found. During weeks 2 – 4, we selected the epilepsy-related sounds and performed independent video verification and labeling (‘snoring’, ‘laryngeal contraction’) of the seizures. The video images were also fully screened for false negatives. In the third part, algorithms in the CLB-monitor detected one specific sound (sleep-related snoring) to illustrate the value of automatic sound recognition. ResultsPart 1 : recognizable sounds (louder than whispering) occurred in 23 (51 %) of the 45 <b>major</b> <b>seizures,</b> 20 seizures (45 %) were below this threshold, and 2 (4 %) were without any sound. Part 2 : in the follow-up group (n= 10, 112 major seizures; mean: 11. 2, range: 1 – 30), we found a mean sensitivity of 0. 81 (range: 0. 33 – 1. 00) and a mean positive predictive value of 0. 40 (range: 0. 06 – 1. 00). All false positive alarms (mean value: 1. 29 per night) were due to minor seizures. We missed 4 seizures (3 %) because of lack of sound and 10 (9 %) because of sounds below the system threshold. Part 3 : the machine-learning algorithms in the CLB-monitor resulted in an overall accuracy for ‘snoring’ of 98. 3 %. ConclusionsAudio detection of <b>major</b> <b>seizures</b> is possible in half of the patients. Lower sound detection thresholds may increase the proportion of suitable candidates. Human selection of seizure-related sounds has a high sensitivity and moderate positive predictive value because of minor seizures which do not need intervention. Algorithms in the CLB-monitor detect seizure-related sounds and may be used alone or in multimodal systems...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of literature, {{describing}} disorders of bone health in epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy have a higher incidence of skeletal fractures due to multiple reasons. Postmenopausal women and elderly men are particularly vulnerable to osteoporosis. A major convulsive seizure can often lead to falls and may result in fractures. Antiepileptic therapy may have seemingly contradictory effects on bone health. It can effectively reduce the incidence of <b>major</b> <b>seizures</b> and prevent the seizure related falls and fractures. However, the central nervous system effects of these drugs increase the risk of falls, especially in the vulnerable population. Long-term antiepileptic therapy may lead to a reduction in bone mineral density, with consequent increase in bone fragility. This can increase the risk for fractures with attendant high morbidity and mortality. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is currently the gold standard for assessing bone mineral density. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed for the reduction in bone mineral density associated with antiepileptic therapy. Most of the available data are from the patients treated with conventional antiepileptic drugs (AED). There is a need for monitoring the effects of the newer AEDs on the bone mineral metabolism. This is of added significance in view of an ageing population and also an increase in the prevalence of epilepsy in the elderly. Physicians treating patients with epilepsy should be made aware of this problem and adequate preventive measures should be advised especially in patients with multiple risk factors.

40|$|Introduction Hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) are {{commonly}} associated with severe epilepsy resistant to anticonvulsant therapy.

Discussion Two series of patients who successfully underwent resection using a transcallosal approach have now been published; we report the first UK experience of this technique {{in a series of}} five patients with HHs and gelastic epilepsy resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively for seizure activity, endocrine function, ophthalmology, and neurocognitive function. Two patients had precocious puberty and all had evidence of developmental delay and behavioral problems. Postoperatively, all children experienced at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency with abolition of <b>major</b> <b>seizure</b> types; one child remains seizure-free.

MethodsPostal survey with a carer completed questionnaire addressed to all adults with epilepsy registered on an LD register in Sheffield, UK (n= 442). ResultsAn analysis based on 225 returned questionnaires revealed that 22. 7 % of individuals with LD and epilepsy had been free of seizures for over 1 year. 95. 1 % were taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), 46. 2 % had had an EEG, and 41. 3 % a brain scan. 53. 3 % of diagnoses {{had been made by}} epilepsy experts, 38. 7 % of individuals with LD and epilepsy were under specialist review. Although patients with more severe epilepsy {{were more likely to be}} under specialist care, 60. 6 % of patients with ongoing seizures, 57. 9 % with <b>major</b> <b>seizures</b> and 68. 7 % of individuals taken to hospital with prolonged had no access to specialist advice.

40|$|Abstract Background Takotsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{an acute}} cardiac syndrome characterized by transient LV regional wall motion abnormalities (with peculiar apical ballooning appearance), chest pain or dyspnea, ST-segment elevation and minor elevations of cardiac enzyme levels Case presentation A 68 -year-old woman {{was admitted to}} the Emergency Department because of sudden onset chest pain occurred while transferring her daughter, who had earlier suffered a <b>major</b> <b>seizure,</b> to the hospital. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation in leads V 2 –V 3 and ST-segment depression in leads V 5 –V 6, she was, thus, referred for emergency coronary angiography. A pre-procedural transthoracic echocardiogram revealed regional systolic dysfunction of the LV walls with hypokinesis of the mid-apical segments and hyperkinesis of the basal segments. Coronary angiography showed patent epicardial coronary arteries; LV angiography demonstrated the characteristic morphology of apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segments and hypokinesis of the mid-apical segments. The post-procedural course was uneventful; on day 5 after admission the echocardiogram revealed full recovery of apical and mid-ventricular regional wall-motion abnormalities. Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a relatively rare, unique entity that has only recently been widely appreciated. Acute stress has been indicated as a common trigger for the transient LV apical ballooning syndrome, especially in postmenopausal women. The present report is a typical example of stress-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a Caucasian Italian postmenopausal woman. </p...|$|R

40|$|Axon {{sprouting}} in dentate granule {{cells is}} an important model of structural plasticity in the hippocampus. Although the process can be triggered by deafferentation, intense activation of glutamate receptors, and other convulsant stimuli, the specific molecular steps required to initiate and sustain mossy fiber (MF) reorganization are unknown. The cellular immediate early genes (IEGs) c-fos, c-jun, and zif/ 268 are major candidates for the initial steps of this plasticity, because they encode transcription factors that may trigger cascades of activitydependent neuronal gene expression and are strongly induced in all experimental models of MF sprouting. The mutant mouse stargazer offers an important opportunity to test the specific role of IEGs, because it displays generalized nonconvulsive epilepsy and intense MF sprouting {{in the absence of}} regional cell injury. Here we report that stargazer mice show no detectable elevations in c-Fos, c-Jun, or Zif/ 268 immediate early gene proteins (IEGPs) before or during MF growth. Experimental results in stargazer, including (1) a strong IEGP response to kainate-induced convulsive seizures, (2) no IEGP response after prolongation of spike-wave synchronization, (3) no IEGP increase at the developmental onset of seizures or after prolonged seizure suppression, and (4) unaltered levels of the intracellular Ca 2 �-buffering proteins calbindin-D 28 k or parvalbumin, exclude the possibility that absence of an IEGP response in stargazer is either gene-linked or suppressed by known refractory mechanisms.
