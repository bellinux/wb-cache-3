40|$|Abstract: <b>Remote</b> <b>sensing</b> is a {{technique}} to observe the earth surface or the atmosphere from out of space using satellites (space borne) or from the air using aircrafts (airborne). <b>Remote</b> <b>sensing</b> uses a part or several parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It records the electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted by the earth’s surface. The amount of radiation from an object (called radiance) is influenced by both {{the properties of the}} object and the radiation hitting the object (irradiance). The human eyes register the solar light reflected by these objects and our brains interpret the colours, the grey tones and intensity variations. In <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> various kinds of tools and devices are used to make electromagnetic radiation outside this range from 400 to 700 nm visible to the human eye, especially the near infrared, middle-infrared, thermal-infrared and <b>microwaves.</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>sensing</b> imagery has many applications in mapping land-use and cover, agriculture, soils mapping, forestry, city planning, archaeological investigations, military observation, and geomorphological surveying, land cover changes, deforestation, vegetation dynamics, water quality dynamics, urban growth, etc. This paper starts with a brief historic overview of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> and then explains the various stages and the basic principles of remotely sensed data collection mechanism...|$|R
