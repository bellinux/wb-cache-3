The phages were not detected unless the soil was nutritionally amended (with glucose or sucrose) and incubated for several days. Phage was continuously produced after amendment without the addition of host Arthrobacter.

40|$|Bacteriophages in {{soil for}} Arthrobacter globiformis were rarely {{detected}} unless the soil was nutritionally amended and incubated. In amended soil, phage were continuously produced {{for at least}} 48 h, and this did not require the addition of host cells. Rod and spheroid stage host cells added to the amended soil encountered indigenous bacteriophage, but added phage did not encounter sensitive indigenous host cells for some time, if at all. The indigenous phage in nonincubated soil seemed {{to be present in}} a <b>masked</b> <b>state</b> which was not merely a loose physical adsorption to soil materials but required growth conditions other than lysogeny for them to increase their titers. The possibility is discussed that the indigenous host cells in nonamended soil are present in a nonsensitive spheroid state, with the cells becoming sensitive to the phage in a rate-limiting fashion as nonsynchronous outgrowth occurs for a portion of the spheroid cells...|$|E
40|$|Amino acid {{composition}} of Bacillus subtilis saccharifying a-amylase [EC 3. 2. 1. 1] was determined. The results {{suggested that the}} protein has consisted of approximately 33 l amino acid residues.

One cysteine residue was shown to be contained per mole of the enzyme as a <b>masked</b> <b>state,</b> which became reactive to the sulfhydryl reagents after inactivation with Et>TA at 60 °C and pH 8. 0. Calcium and the sole sulfhydryl group seemed to be essential for the enzymatic activity.

40|$|International audienceWe {{revisit the}} problem of <b>state</b> <b>masking</b> and <b>state</b> {{amplification}} for state-dependent channel with causal state information at the encoder {{from the point of}} view of empirical coordination. Empirical coordination, which requires all sequences of symbols to be jointly typical for a target joint probability distribution, provides a unified perspective to simultaneously study <b>state</b> <b>masking,</b> <b>state</b> amplification, and capacity-distortion trade-off. Our main result is a characterization of the set of achievable rates, information leakages and joint distributions. We also discuss several specializations and extensions of the result, including the cases of zero message rate, without empirical coordination, strictly causal encoding, two-sided state information and noisy channel feedback. We introduce the notion of "core of the decoder's knowledge," to capture what the decoder can infer about all the signals involved in the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} {{lost during}} storage {{of a solution}} of muscle glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase was rapidly restored on adding a thiol, but not arsenite or azide. On treatment with H_ 2 O_ 2, the enzyme was partially inactivated and complete loss of activity occurred {{in the presence of}} glutathione. Samples of the enzyme pretreated with glutathione followed by removal of the thiol by filtration on a Sephadex column showed both full activity and its complete loss on adding H_ 2 O_ 2, in the absence of added glutathione. Most of the activity was restored when the H_ 2 O_ 2 -inactivated enzyme was incubated with glutathione (25 mM) or dithiothreitol (5 mM), whereas arsenite or azide were partially effective and ascorbate was ineffective. The need for incubation for a long time with a strong reducing agent for restoration of activity suggested that the oxidized group (disulfide or sulfenate) must be in a <b>masked</b> <b>state</b> in the H_ 2 O_ 2 -inactivated enzyme. Analysis by SDS-PAGE gave evidence for the formation of a small quantity of glutathione-reversible disulfide-form of the enzyme. CD spectra indicated a decrease in α-helical content in the activated form of the enzyme. The evidence suggested that glutathione and H_ 2 O_ 2 could regulate the active state of this enzyme...|$|E

50|$|The 8085 has {{extensions}} {{to support}} new interrupts, with three maskable vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one non-maskable interrupt (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each {{of these five}} interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid {{the cost of a}} separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is edge triggered (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction. In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three maskable RST interrupts to be individually masked. All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt <b>mask</b> <b>state</b> and the three independent RST interrupt <b>mask</b> <b>states</b> to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a binary energy har-vesting transmitter that wishes {{to control the}} amount of side information the receiver can obtain about its energy harvests. Specifically, we study state amplification and <b>state</b> <b>masking,</b> which define the maximum and minimum amount of state information conveyed to the receiver for a given message rate, re-spectively. For an independent and identically distributed energy harvesting process, we first find the amplification and masking regions for a transmitter without a battery and a transmitter with an infinite battery. Next, we find inner bounds for these regions for a unit-sized battery at the transmitter using two different encoding schemes, using instantaneous Shannon strategies and using a scheme based on the equivalent timing channel introduced in our previous work. We observe that the former provides better state amplification, while the latter provides better <b>state</b> <b>masking.</b> I...|$|R
