The enzyme pGluDH does not occur in the host red blood cell and was recommended as a <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme</b> for Plasmodium species by Picard-Maureau et al. in 1975. The malaria <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme</b> test is suitable for routine work and is now a standard test in most departments dealing with malaria. Presence of pGluDH is known to represent parasite viability and a rapid diagnostic test using pGluDH as antigen would have the ability to differentiate live from dead organisms. A complete RDT with pGluDH as antigen has been developed in China and is now undergoing clinical trials.|$|E

Throughout the tissue-fractionation procedures {{the distribution of the}} two enzymes paralleled that of the plastid <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme</b> (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase), even in Arum, a tissue where the synthesis of non-plastid haem is predominant. The distribution of cytosolic <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme</b> (lactate dehydrogenase) was significantly different from that of ALAD and PBGD and, although purified mitochondria from both species had some residual activity, this was always less than contaminating plastid <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The results suggest that ALAD and PBGD are exclusively plastid enzymes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Bcl- 2 expression in alternations in mitochondrial energy regulation during hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and role in necrosis and apoptosis. Total 12 Wistar rats were divided into sham-operated control group (I) and ischemia and reperfusion group (II). Mitochondrial tri carboxylic acid cycles <b>marker</b> <b>enzymes,</b> respiratory <b>marker</b> <b>enzymes,</b> apoptotic cells, necrotic cells and Bcl- 2 expression was measured.

40|$|An {{electron}} microscope cytochemical technique {{was used to}} determine the subcellular distribution of marker enzymes in Fusidium sp. 100 - 3 cells. Nucleoside diphosphatase was found in the nuclear envelope and intracytoplasmic membrane segment. Thiamine pyrophosphatase was found {{to be associated with the}} mesosomes. Cytochrome c (oxidase) activity was found only in the mitochondrial cristae. Strong alkaline phosphatase activity was present in the vacuole; in addition, the enzyme activity was discretely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm without any association with any membrane material. The overall characteristics of the cell ultrastructure and subcellular enzyme distribution of Fusidium sp. 100 - 3 cells compare fairly well with those of a fungal cell. But there are considerable differences from the characteristics of higher eucaryotic cells. Detailed data on the marker enzymes distribution in a variety of fungal cells are not available. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the <b>marker</b> <b>enzyme</b> distribution of Fusidium sp. 100 - 3 cells is unique or is typical of any fungal organism.

Piperine (25 mg/kg b. w. i. p.) and standard drug silymarin (25 mg/kg b. w. i. p.) were given to mice, 30 min after the single injection of acetaminophen. After 4 h, the mice were decapitated.

Total erythrocyte count (− 54.52  %), hemoglobin (− 36.98  %), packed cell volume (− 36.25  %), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (− 1.41  %) and oxygen (O 2) carrying capacity (− 37.04  %) declined significantly over reference fish, however total leukocyte count (+ 25.43  %), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (+ 33.52  %) and mean corpuscular volume (+ 35.49  %) showed elevation. High frequency of micronuclei (1133.3  %) and lobed nuclei (150  %) were observed in exposed fish which may indicate mutagenesis. Activities of pathological <b>marker</b> <b>enzymes</b> ALP, AST, ALT and CK increased significantly in serum of exposed fish. The ratio of ALT: AST in exposed fish was beyond 1 which indicates manifestation of pathological processes. These biomarkers show that fish have macrocytic hypochromic anemia.
