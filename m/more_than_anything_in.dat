500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records.

2500|$|Nationally {{known and}} local writers have {{frequently}} remarked on the solitude and visual appeal of Church in the Wood. [...] A description of 1777 noted that although [...] "the graveyard now contains many handsome monuments ... it still retains {{something of the}} sequestered situation ... {{in the middle of}} a wood". [...] A description from 1874 stated simply that [...] "the Church is picturesquely situated in the heart of a romantic wood, having no hut or house of any kind within a quarter of a mile".
