The focus in this study was on multi-layered multi-material polymer composite laminates consisting of 0 / 90 and ± 45 layers of either; 52 Glass/Epoxy or Carbon/Epoxy non crimp fabric. A multi-scale finite element modelling methodology was developed at the micro and <b>meso</b> <b>scale</b> for predicting the elastic response, damage in itiation, damage evolution and strain rate dependence of macro scale polymer composite materials. The methodology was implemented in the Abaqus finite element package utilising Python scripting for simulation definition and Fortran code for user defined explicit material subroutines. Micro scale unit cells were tested in longitudinal, transverse and shear loa. ding directions over a range of strain rates. The results of the micro scale testing were converted into material properties of the <b>meso</b> <b>scale</b> yarns / tows. <b>Meso</b> <b>scale</b> unit cells were tested in in-plane, through thickness and shear loading directions over of a range of strain rates.

Allison formed close to shore, and the combination of continuous Doppler radar, satellite, aircraft, and surface observations allows for the examination of tropical cyclogenesis in great detail. Preceding Allison’s genesis, PV superposition on the large scale created an environment where decreased vertical shear and increased instability, surface fluxes, and low-level cyclonic vorticity coexisted. This presented a favorable environment for <b>meso</b> [...] <b>scale</b> PV production by widespread convection and {{led to the formation of}} surface-based, <b>meso</b> [...] <b>scale</b> vortices [termed convective burst vortices (CBVs) ]. The CBVs seemed to form in association with intense bursts of convection and rotated around each other within the meso- circulation field.

However, despite the {{great deal of}} research in the area, a number of challenges still need to be faced (i) to make agent-based computing a widely accepted paradigm in software engineering practice, and (ii) to turn agent-oriented software abstractions into practical tools for facing the complexity of modern application areas. In this paper, after a short introduction to the key concepts of agent-based computing (as they pertain to software engineering), we characterise the emerging key issues in multiagent systems (MASs) engineering. In particular, we show that such issues can be analysed in terms of three different ‘‘scales of observation’’, i. e., in analogy with the scales of observation of physical phenomena, in terms of micro, macro, and <b>meso</b> <b>scales.</b> Based on this characterisation, we discuss, for each scale of observation, what are the peculiar engineering issues arising, the key research challenges to be solved, and the most promising research directions to be explored in the future...|$|R

At the micro scale level, we perform particle-resolved numerical simulations using a Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain approach. At the <b>meso</b> <b>scale</b> level, we use a two-way Euler/Lagrange approach with a Gaussian filtering kernel to model fluid-solid momentum transfer. At both the micro and <b>meso</b> <b>scale</b> levels, particles are individually tracked in a Lagrangian way and all inter-particle collisions are computed by a Discrete Element/Soft-sphere method. The previous numerical models have been extended to handle particles of arbitrary shape (non-spherical, angular and even non-convex) as well as to treat heat and mass transfer. All simulation tools are fully-MPI parallel with standard domain decomposition and run on supercomputers with a satisfactory scalability on up to a few thousands of cores. The main asset of multi scale analysis is the ability to extend our comprehension of the dynamics of suspension flows based on the knowledge acquired from the high-fidelity micro scale simulations and to use that knowledge to improve the <b>meso</b> <b>scale</b> model. We illustrate how we can benefit from this strategy for a fluidized bed, where we introduce a stochastic drag force model derived from micro-scale simulations to recover the proper level of particle fluctuations.

All the particles of this vanishing row are distributed throughout the crystal. If the confining walls are structured (say with a corrugation {{along the length of the}} walls), then these extra particles are distributed neither uniformly nor randomly; rather, defect structures are created along the boundaries resembling "soliton staircases", inducing a non-uniform strain pattern within the crystal.
