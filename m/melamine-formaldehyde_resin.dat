50|$|<b>Melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> forms via the {{condensation}} of formaldehyde with melamine to give, under idealized conditions, the hexa-hydroxymethyl derivative. Upon heating in {{the presence}} of acid, this or similar hydroxymethylated species undergoes further condensation and crosslinking. Linkages between the heterocycles include mono-, di-, and polyethers. The microstructure of the material can be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|HPL {{consists}} {{of more than}} 60 to 70% paper, with the remaining 30 to 40% a combination of phenol-formaldehyde resin for the core layers and <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> for the surface layer. Both resins belong to a class of thermosetting resins which crosslink during the press cycle creating irreversible chemical bonds that produce a nonreactive, stable material with characteristics different and superior {{to those of the}} component parts.|$|E

5000|$|Amino resins {{are another}} class of {{thermoset}} prepolymers formed by copolymerisation of amines or amides with an aldehyde. Urea-formaldehyde and <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> although not {{widely used in}} high performance structural composite applications, are characteristically used as the polymer matrix in molding and extrusion compounds where some use of fillers and reinforcements occurs. Urea-formaldehyde resins are widely used as the matrix binder in construction utility products such as particle board, wafer board, and plywood, which are true particulate and laminar composite structures. <b>Melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> are used for plastic laminating.|$|R
5000|$|... {{n-butanol}} is {{an intermediate}} {{in the production}} of butyl acrylate, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, and other butyl esters, butyl ethers such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, di- and triethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and the corresponding butyl ether acetates. Other industrial uses include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, polymers, pyroxylin plastics, herbicide esters, printing (e.g., 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T) and butyl xanthate. It is also used as a diluent/reactant in the manufacture of urea-formaldehyde and <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Melamine is {{commonly}} produced from urea, mainly by either catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production, and is soluble in water. Melamine is used combined with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a very durable thermosetting plastic, and melamine foam, a polymeric cleaning product. The end products include counter-tops, fabrics, glues and flame retardants. Occasionally, <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> {{is added to}} gluten for non-food purposes, such as adhesives or fabric printing.|$|E
50|$|Melamine {{is used to}} {{manufacture}} <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin,</b> a type of plastic known for its flame-retardant properties and commonly employed in countertops, dry-erase boards, etc. Melamine itself is nitrogen-rich and is sometimes illegally added to food products to increase their apparent protein content. It has also been employed as a non-protein nitrogen, appearing in soy meal, corn gluten meal and cottonseed meal used in cattle feed. Melamine is known to cause renal failure and kidney stones in humans and animals when it reacts with cyanuric acid inside the body. The use of melamine in food production is not approved by WHO or national authorities.|$|E
40|$|Even {{though there}} are some {{adhesives}} for cold pressing, such as casein, viscose and urea formaldehyde resin, they fall behind the melamine resin adhesives in resistance to water. In general, the <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> adhesives {{are very sensitive to}} small variation in PH and gelatinize to solid materials. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} observe the effect of the gelatinizastion controlling reagents to these adhesives. 　Good results have been attained with thio-urea, resorcin and hexamethylene-tetramine. In this paper the effect of thio-ures is discussed in the view of tensile strength and a new process for the production of <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> adheesive was proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} developed force field has been employed {{to interpret the}} vibrational spectra of methylolmelamines and their bridged oligomers in <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> adducts and <b>resins.</b> The results show that some surprising experimentally observed features, such as the apparent insensitivity {{of one of the}} ring breathing modes and the very strong sensitivity of the other ring breathing mode upon methylolation, can be fully recovered from the calculations. Most, although not all, assignments based on the present calculations are in agreement with previous assignments based on purely experimental data. It is thus shown that vibrational analysis with a good quality force field can significantly contribute to a further understanding of the spectra of complex systems such as <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Etherified {{amino resins}} {{are used in}} {{conjunction}} with alkyds, polyesters, epoxy or acrylic resins in coating formulation. They are formed from the reaction between formaldehyde and compounds containing NH 2 groups, for example, amide, amine or imide groups. Control of this reaction is important in order to obtain the appropriate mixture targeted for the intended use and, as a consequence, the development of analytical procedures able to describe the different species present in the final resin mixtures is necessary. The use of high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with electrospray ionisation or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry, proved to be efficient in the characterisation of n-butylated <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> The same analytical approach was also applied to describe the first steps in the synthesis of i-butylated urea-formaldehyde resins...|$|R
40|$|MGG’) resin {{adhesives}} for bonding {{wood panels}} were prepared {{by a single}} step procedure, namely reacting melamine with glyoxal and simultaneously with a much smaller proportion of glutaraldehyde. No formaldehyde was used. The inherent slow hardening of this resin was overcome {{by the addition of}} N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone hydrogen sulphate ionic liquid as the adhesive hardener in the glue mix. The plywood strength results obtained were comparable with those obtained with <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> pressed under the same conditions. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight (MALDI ToF) and Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis allowed the identification of the main oligomer species obtained and of the different types of linkages formed, as well as to indicate the multifaceted role of the ionic liquid. These resins are proposed as a suitable substitute for equivalent formaldehyde-based resins...|$|R

Characterisation included differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Thermal analysis, AFM and ESEM support the occurrence of a partial compatibilisation. In particular, the DSC {{results showed that the}} melting peaks intermediate between those of pure components...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} environmentally-friendly {{approach}} for {{the preparation of}} porous <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (PMFRs) was developed by using low-boiling-point solvents, such as water, as pore-forming agent. With using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and low-boiling solvents cosolvent method, PMFRs with a high specific surface area and well-defined pore structure can be synthesized at a low reaction temperature of 140 °C for a short reaction duration in 20 hours, which can replace the conventional methods that use dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as reaction medium and require 3 days at 170 °C to achieve similar surface area. When loaded with polyethylenimine (PEI), the PMFR-PEI- 30 % showed good CO 2 adsorption performance with a capacity of up to 2. 89 mmol/g at 30 °C. These results bring new perspectives {{for the development of}} lowcost and environmentally-friendly synthetic methods for porous materials, which can boost their widespread applications...|$|R
40|$|Alkyd/melamine resin {{mixtures}} {{are mainly}} used in industrial baking enamels. The {{effects of the}} alkyd/butylated melamine resin ratio (from 90 / 10 to 50 / 50) and curing temperature (from 110 to 180 °C) on the crosslinking and {{properties of the coating}} are presented in this paper. The curing reactions through functional groups of resins were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy. The hardness, elasticity, degree of adherence and gloss were also determined. Optimal coating properties could be achieved with an alkyd/melamine resin ratio of 80 / 20, a curing temperature of 150 °C and a curing time of 20 min. Organic coatings based on alkyd and melamine resins are high-quality industrial finishes. The combination of <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> with suitable alkyd resin in surface coatings yields better hardness, mar and chemical resistance, improves weatherability, and reduces thermal curing times [1].

30|$|Nowadays, the {{modification}} of activated carbon {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} adsorption. It is focused mostly {{on the development of the}} material with basic oxygen or nitrogen groups. It is indeed well known that nitrogen-containing surface groups confer to AC an increased ability to absorb acid gases [11, 12] and phenolic compounds [13]. Usually, there are several methods for obtaining the AC enriched in nitrogen. One of the methods is carbonization followed by activation of plastics containing nitrogen in their structure [14]. Another method of getting nitrogen-enriched AC is the exposure of the preliminary AC to nitrogen compounds in elevated temperatures [15, 16]. A very effective process of nitrogen introduction into carbons is ammoxidation [17, 18]. In the waste MDF, nitrogen is provided by the adhesive: urea–formaldehyde and <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> dispersed all through the board, and the impregnating each particle of wood. So, the preparation of nitrogen-enriched AC from waste MDF can be accessible.|$|R
30|$|Variation of {{the methods}} for modifying the surface of carbon {{nanotubes}} by nitrogen-containing polymers {{makes it possible to}} control the content of surface nitrogen groups. The highest concentration (8 at.%) was obtained using the surface polymerization of the <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> The higher activity values in the ORR and specific power density in PEMFC are observed for Pt/CNT-MF catalyst with a high content of nitrogen surface groups. This is especially noticeable when comparing the activities obtained in the cathode scans (see Table  3), where the platinum surface is covered mainly with oxygen compounds.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{a series}} of 40 wt% Pt {{catalysts}} based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified with nitrogen was prepared and studied. Two approaches {{were used for the}} CNT surface functionalization with nitrogen: polymerization of adsorbed melamine and <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> in the presence of CNT. CNT modified by the second approach was recently shown to be promising for the Pt-free ORR catalyst in alkaline media [31]. Performance of the catalysts in the ORR was evaluated in electrochemical cell and in PEMFC. The results showed that the use of nitrogen-modified nanotubes makes it possible to increase significantly the utilization of Pt and the specific power density in PEMFC.|$|E

In this protocol, treatment of structurally diverse aldehydes, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and tetrabutylammonium azide (TBAA) as an azide {{source in the}} presence of nano-Cu 2 O–MFR as an efficient heterogeneous nano-catalyst affords the corresponding 5 -substituted 1 H-tetrazoles in good to excellent yields. The influence of different parameters on the progress of reaction was studied.

40|$|Nine {{structural}} adhesives {{with varying}} pH {{were selected to}} {{examine the effect of}} adhesive pH on wood–adhesive bond quality. The adhesives evaluated included four highly alkaline phenol–formaldehyde, one intermediate pH phenol–resorcinol–formaldehyde, two acidic melamine–urea–formaldehyde, and two acidic <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> Block shear specimens were prepared using Douglas-fir and black spruce wood. The adhesive performance was evaluated by measuring the shear properties (strength and wood failure) of the specimens tested at the dry and vacuum–pressure–redry (VPD) conditions. Adhesive pH, test condition, and wood species showed significant effects on shear properties. The different adhesives performed differently at the dry and VPD conditions. The high-pH adhesives (phenol–formaldehyde and phenol–resorcinol–formaldehyde) showed similar high wood failures at both test conditions and performed better than the low-pH adhesives (melamine–formaldehyde and melamine–urea–formaldehyde), especially after the VPD conditioning. The low-pH adhesives showed high wood failure at the dry condition, but wood failure decreased significantly after VPD conditioning for both species, indicating that the low-pH adhesives were less durable than the high-pH adhesives. High-pH adhesives did not {{have a negative impact on}} the strength of the bonded specimens. Upprättat; 2010; 20121113 (aliwan...|$|R

40|$|Perfume is an {{expensive}} ingredient for most laundry detergents. To target its delivery to the fabric fibres {{at the right moment}} after the wash, improve its performance and reduce costs, using perfume microcapsules is one of the technologies that have been developed. Old technology based on <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> presents some safety and environmental issues and current microcapsules made by interfacial polymerisation techniques do not provide the desired performance. In this work it has been done a deep study of the interfacial polymerisation process focusing on the effect that the formulation and process conditions have on the final properties of the microcapsules produced. The microcapsule walls have been characterized by SEM, TEM and FTIR. The encapsulation efficiency, release profile of the perfume from the microcapsules and their mechanical properties have also been measured. Microcapsules prepared at low temperature with a mix of trimesoyl and terephthaloyl chloride as organic monomers and diethylenetriamine, hexamethylenediamine and ethylenediamine as aqueous monomers showed good mechanical strength and low permeability which make them of industrial interest. Microencapsulation of glycerol for its potential use in lipsticks and other cosmetic products has also been achieved. The use of a salt (magnesium sulphate) greatly stabilized the emulsion and permitted to form small and uniform microcapsules. The process conditions selected may also be applied to encapsulate other oil-based or water soluble active ingredients for various industrial applications...|$|R
30|$|A {{series of}} {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (CNT) modified with nitrogen-containing groups was synthesized. The modification {{was carried out}} using two surface polymerization approaches: (1) melamine adsorbed {{on the surface of}} nanotubes (CNT-M), and (2) <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (CNT-MF). According to XPS, the observable nitrogen content in CNTs was of 1 and 8.3 at.%, respectively. According to CO gas-phase titration and TEM data, 40 mass. % Pt/C catalysts synthesized using nitrogen-modified carbon nanotubes showed almost uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles with the surface average size of 3 – 4  nm. However, the nitrogen-modified catalysts showed a greater part of Pt nanoparticles with the 0 – 2  nm dimension.

The effects of degree of sulphonation and F/M ratio on the fluidly of resin solutions were studied. The F/M ratio is directly and SlM ratio is {{inversely proportional to}} viscosity of the resin solution. Because of lower viscosity of HSMF resins than that of SMF resins, {{it is expected to}} be more effective superplasticizer in cement sand mortar.

40|$|Currently, {{functional}} additives {{represented by}} many classes of substances and compounds, including polymers of different origin, {{are widely used}} {{in the production of}} dry mixtures based on gypsum binders. However, the impact of these additives produced on the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO 42 H 2 O) crystals {{in the course of the}} hardening of gypsum binders, is not quite clear. Therefore, the research is aimed at the clarification of the processes of growth and formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals in the presence of functional additives based on polymers of different origin. The research is composed of the following stages. At the first stage, calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals were synthesized both in the pure form and with additives. The additives included super plasticizers based on sulfonated <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (SMF), methylcellulose (MC) and polymer powder based on copolymer of vinyl acetate, ethylene and vinyl chloride (VAEVC). At the second stage, X-ray analysis of the synthesized crystals was performed to identify potential patterns of influence produced by polymer additives onto the shape and size of calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals. At the third stage, thermal analysis and electron microscopy methods were applied to synthesized crystals. The research suggests the following conclusions: A. It is identified that additives based on polymers of different origin affect processes of crystallization, the size and shape of crystals. B. The X-ray diffraction analysis has proven that molecules of polymer additives do not penetrate into the gypsum structure and the chemical composition of the product does not change. C. Methods of thermal analysis have proven that the introduction of polymer additives does not produce any adverse impact on the stability of gypsum crystals, if exposed to temperature fluctuations. D.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{adsorption}} processes are used commercially for adsorbent process, including {{pressure swing adsorption}} (PSA), vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA), and thermal or temperature swing adsorption (TSA). A number of research works have been done using the processes mentioned above on different types of adsorbent materials. Recent developments have demonstrated that PSA is a promising option for separating CO 2 due to its ease of applicability over a relatively wide range of temperature and pressure conditions, its low energy requirements, and its low capital investment cost (Agarwal et al. [8]). Many studies concerning CO 2 removal from various flue gas mixtures by means of PSA processes have been addressed in the literature. Prior {{to the design of}} an adsorption process, selecting an appropriate adsorbent with high selectivity and working capacity, as well as a strong desorption capability, is key to separating CO 2. As a result, a wide variety of adsorbents like activated carbon, zeolites, silica gel, activated alumina, urea–formaldehyde and <b>melamine–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> poly-ethyleneimine and hollow fiber carbon membranes based adsorbents, etc. have been investigated for this purpose [9]; Sircar et al. [10]; [11, 12, 17]. Recent development shows an improvement in adsorbent materials with higher adsorption capacity and selectivity like Activated carbon honeycomb monolith—Zeolite 13 X hybrid system, zeolites NaKA and nano-NaKA, FAU zeolites and zeolite 13 X prepared from bentonite [13, 14, 15, 16].|$|R
