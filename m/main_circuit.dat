Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the <b>main</b> <b>circuit.</b> This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

[...] The more popular groups stuck to the <b>main</b> <b>circuit</b> that ran through the Northeast; some even went to Europe, which allowed their competitors to establish themselves in their absence. By the late 1840s, a southern tour had opened from Baltimore to New Orleans. Circuits through the Midwest and as far as California followed by the 1860s. As its popularity increased, theaters sprang up specifically for minstrel performance, often with names such as the Ethiopian Opera House and the like. Many amateur troupes performed only a few local shows before disbanding. Meanwhile, celebrities like Emmett continued to perform solo.|$|E

40|$|A {{progressive}} loss of {{episodic memory}} {{is a well-known}} clinical symptom that characterizes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The beginning of this loss of memory {{has been associated with}} the very early, pathological accumulation of tau and neuronal degeneration observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Tau-related pathology is thought to then spread progressively to the hippocampal formation and other brain areas as the disease progresses. The major cortical afferent source of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus is the EC through the perforant pathway. At least two <b>main</b> <b>circuits</b> participate in the connection between EC and the hippocampus; one originating in layer II and the other in layer III of the EC giving rise to the classical trisynaptic (ECII→dentate gyrus→CA 3 →CA 1) and monosynaptic (ECIII→CA 1) circuits. Thus, the study of the early pathological changes in these circuits is of great interest. In this review, we will discuss mainly the alterations of the granule cell neurons of the dentate gyrus and the atrophy of CA 1 pyramidal neurons that occur in AD in relation to the possible differential alterations of these two <b>main</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Time {{correlated}} photon counting {{techniques have}} been {{proved to be}} very effective, especially when very fast and faint optical signals have to be recorded with extremely high precision. Nowadays, a steadily increasing number of applications require not only high performance in terms of photon detection efficiency, time resolution and linearity but also {{a high number of}} pixels operating in parallel. In order to combine the features of the most performing detectors and state of art timing electronics, an innovative architecture has been conceived and the <b>main</b> <b>circuits</b> have been designed. The system will employ dense arrays of custom technology Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detectors, in order to perform a truly concurrent analysis of the sample, while it will have {{only a small number of}} acquisition chains with the ultimate purpose of obtaining very high performance while limiting area occupation and power dissipation. To this aim, three <b>main</b> <b>circuits</b> have been designed: first of all, a pick-up circuit capable of directly reading the signal coming from the sensor; secondly, a timing circuit to measure the arrival time of the each photon with picoseconds resolution and very high linearity and finally, a circuit to perform a dynamic binding between the many sensors and the few conversion chains...|$|R
