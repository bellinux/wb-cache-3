This paper presents a new method to determine the positions and the postures of the representative points for continuous interpolation. These positions and the postures are determined using 3 D Configuration space(C-Space) consisting three parameters for representing the measuring posture. For details, the measurable postures are mapped in the C-Space on each measuring point. Then, the positions of the representative points are determined using a local maximum value of the distance between centroid coordinate of the measurable postures in adjacent points. Moreover, the postures of them are determined using the common postures of adjacent points or the distance from the origin of the C-Space. The continuity of the <b>measuring</b> <b>path</b> is evaluated from the change in the joint angle of the robot.

40|$|AbstractReverse {{engineering}} {{technology has been}} widely recognized as a crucial strategy for innovative design of products. However, currently one of major problems for its application is that huge amounts of digitized points cloud data need to be processed for geometrical surface modelling, especially for unknown free-form surfaces which are widely used in industry fields such as aircraft, automobile, shipbuilding, steam turbine, etc. In order to digitize unknown free-form surfaces accurately and efficiently, an adaptive sampling approach based on advanced path detecting has been presented. The method is characterized by integrating one touch- trigger probe and two laser probes onto the same Z axis of Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), and the two laser probes are located {{on both sides of}} the touch probe. During sampling, the CMM scans the free-form surface line by line. At the scanning direction, the laser probes are applied to collect the <b>measuring</b> <b>path</b> information in front of the touch probe. And the data acquired by the laser probes is processed and fitted into B-spline curves real-timely, and then the curvature feature of the <b>measuring</b> <b>path</b> is extracted. The obtained path information is used to generate a new <b>measuring</b> <b>path</b> for touch probe to achieve adaptive sampling. While at the cross-section feeding direction, curvature analysis algorithm based on the angle variation between measuring sections is employed to subdivide the cross-sections when needed. Repeating this procedure, the measuring sections will be distributed adaptively. Simulation and experiment results indicate that the sampling points generated by the touch probe are laid out rationally according to the curvature of the surfaces, therefore the sampling efficiency and accuracy can be improved significantly by the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{wireless}} communications {{in a tree}} canopy is essential for pre-harvesting control of fruit productions. To efficiently communicate between a sensor node and a sink node, channel characteristics in a tree canopy must be well-established. In this paper, propagation channel characteristics at the frequencies of 2. 45 and 5. 2 GHz have been estimated for designing a wireless communication system in a tree canopy. The proposed solution is based on <b>measured</b> <b>path</b> loss, time-varying signal strength and Angle of Arrival (AoA) for various paths in a tree canopy to estimate the channel. Since the waves reflect, refract, diffract and scatter from the foliage, it is complicated to find the true travelling path between a transmitter and a receiver at the nodes. The AoA estimator is used for physical interpretation of the channel. The experimental results demonstrate the channels in a tree canopy are mostly matched with the General Extreme Value model.
