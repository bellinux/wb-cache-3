25|$|The {{executive}} offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity, {{and he was}} still not able to fit the traditional mold of conservatism that was usually expected of someone of his stature. When John was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a first-class manager in that position to sort things out – company man or not. The new model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro, and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May 1974 KLM Noordzee Helikopters S-61N PH-NZC crashed {{en route}} to an oil rig in the North Sea. None of the two crew and four {{passengers}} survived. The probable cause was a failure in one of five rotor blades due to metal fatigue. The resulting imbalance caused the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to fail and resulted in a fire. The uncontrollable aircraft landed hard in the water, capsized and sank. Investigation indicated that the metal fatigue crack must have spread rapidly {{in less than four}} hours. The rotor blades are pressurized with nitrogen gas at 10PSI to indicate the onset of a metal fatigue failure, yet no pressure loss was indicated during the preflight inspection. As a result of the accident it was recommended to shorten inspection intervals [...] The aircraft was recovered from the North Sea floor. It was rebuilt and currently flies as registration N87580 in the USA.|$|E

5000|$|... 1958 - Bosses {{for side}} <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> {{were added to}} the block casting, {{utilized}} for production mounts for this and all future model years. However, the features for front <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> as used in 1955-1957 remained part of the block casting in this and future years. The 265-cubic-inch version of the engine was discontinued. Also, the cylinder head valve cover mounting bolt holes were changed from the top row staggered (relative to the bottom row of bolts) to the [...] "straight-across" [...] pattern that remained the way of identifying the early heads from the newer ones with a valve cover design which lasted until the 1987 center-bolt-style covers.|$|E

50|$|The M42 also {{incorporates}} other performance {{features such}} as a forged steel crankshaft and welded tubular stainless steel exhaust manifold instead of the more typical cast-iron items. BMW also fitted hydraulic <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to decrease the inline four's inherent noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) compared to the smoother inline sixes already in production at that time.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for the {{development}} of acoustic quieting techniques was for making submarines difficult to detect by sonar. This military goal of the mid- and late-twentieth century allowed the technology to be adapted to many industries and products, such as computers (e.g. hard drive technology), automobiles (e.g. <b>motor</b> <b>mounts),</b> and even sporting goods (e.g. golf clubs).|$|E
5000|$|The graph {{shows the}} effect of a tuned mass damper on a simple spring-mass-damper system, excited by {{vibrations}} with an amplitude of one unit of force applied to the main mass, [...] An important measure of performance is the ratio of the force on the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to the force vibrating the motor, [...] This assumes that the system is linear, so if the force on the motor were to double, so would the force on the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts.</b> The blue line represents the baseline system, with a maximum response of 9 units of force at around 9 units of frequency. The red line shows {{the effect of}} adding a tuned mass of 10% of the baseline mass. It has a maximum response of 5.5, at a frequency of 7. As a side effect, it also has a second normal mode and will vibrate somewhat more than the baseline system at frequencies below about 6 and above about 10.|$|E
50|$|Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were {{replaced}} by hydraulic systems and electric motor-driven systems. Most systems today are driven by an electric <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> at each tower.|$|R
50|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> bolts. Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on <b>motor</b> can be <b>mounted</b> anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. If it does vary, then the standard Singer V belts can be too long or too short. In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|R
50|$|The Porcupine used “Jam-pot” shocks and Teledraulic race forks. The E90 model had an open frame. The E95, {{introduced}} in 1953, had a loop type frame with the <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> lower.|$|R
50|$|To {{handle the}} extra weight power-steering was added, and the rear axle was beefed up. As an added bonus, Chrysler shipped the engines with an {{air-conditioning}} compressor, so that feature was added at the same time. Other minor changes included fabricating the requisite <b>motor</b> <b>mounts,</b> having two new vents let into the fenders and, on later models, two additional grilles fitted to the hood.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel hop, wheelspin, and {{a general}} lack of {{traction}} were problems frequently encountered with the supercharged Cobalt due to its front drive setup and relatively high torque. Upgraded front and rear trans and <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> would help to alleviate these issues. [...] The GM Performance Division later tried to rectify these problems in the turbocharged car by providing wider, stickier tires and stronger axles.|$|E
50|$|Swapping of the four-cylinder RS engines is {{slightly}} {{more complicated than}} the V6 GS mainly due to ECU, wiring harness, and MAF combinations as well as <b>motor</b> <b>mounts.</b> The V6 swaps require specific ECU, intake manifold, and VAF sensor combinations, but there are far fewer variables to deal with. Many improvements can be made after the engine swap and during the engine tuning process {{to find the best}} combination of engine peripherals.|$|E
5000|$|The Vélosolex has a [...] <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> {{above the}} front wheel. Power is {{delivered}} via a small ceramic roller that rotates {{directly on the}} front wheel by friction to the tire.|$|R
2500|$|... {{power may}} be {{transferred}} to a wheel from a <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> directly above, by bringing a powered roller or rubber belt {{into contact with the}} tire. These are called [...] "friction drives".|$|R
2500|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128.

50|$|In the Hotchkiss drive, slip-splines or a plunge-type (ball and {{trunnion}} u-joint) eliminate thrust transmitted {{back up the}} driveshaft {{from the}} axle, allowing simple rear-axle positioning using parallel leaf springs. In the torque-tube type this thrust is taken by the torque tube to the transmission and thence to the transmission and <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to the frame. While the torque-tube type requires additional locating elements, such as a Panhard rod, this allows the use of coil springs.|$|E
50|$|The new engine's {{overhead}} camshaft design {{was only one}} of the advanced features offered {{for the first time in}} a U.S.-designed and mass-produced engine. The Tornado was a good engine; unfortunately, it was complex (by 1960s standards) and was discontinued in civilian vehicles in the U.S. in 1965. It continued to be used in military versions of the Jeep pickup, the M-715 and M-725, until 1969. These engines had block-mounted <b>motor</b> <b>mounts,</b> rather than the front cover mounts that were a cause of oil leaks on the civilian versions.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} {{problem with}} either the 3.5L (though true {{for any of the}} OM60x family diesels) is lack of maintenance of the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts,</b> which results in hard engine vibration from the engine resting on the frame members. Especially in the OM603, the vibration helps loosen one of the myriad of small screws in the crankcase which primarily hold on the windage tray. If these small bolts and screws find their way into the oil pump or passages, the resulting oil starvation can cause bearing failure, and subsequent broken or thrown rods—often cracking the block. Proper motor mount maintenance eliminates these issues.|$|E
