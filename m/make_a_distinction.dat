Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore {{the integrity of the}} wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E

25|$|Zoophilia is a {{paraphilia}} {{involving a}} sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms {{are often used}} interchangeably, but some researchers <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).|$|E
25|$|In word {{games that}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between vowels and consonants, IJ is {{considered}} to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether Y is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since Y can represent both a vowel or a (half-)consonant.|$|E

It is necessary therefore to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between the two situations.

25|$|In colloquial Brazilian Portuguese, esse {{is often}} used interchangeably with este {{when there is no}} need to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{distinction}}.</b> This distinction is usually only made in formal writing or by people with more formal education, or simply to emphasize the fact that it is near, as in esta sexta! ("next Friday!").|$|E
25|$|Paeonia corallina is {{a synonym}} of Paeonia mascula, so cannot {{be applied to}} the taxa of P. daurica. According to the most recent taxonomic review of this complex of taxa, no {{morphological}} differences occur that are distinct enough to recognize separate species. There are however sufficient differences between the average character states between populations to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between seven subtaxa useful.|$|E

25|$|At {{the present}} stage of CFE theory development, it is {{important}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on voltage V.|$|E
25|$|Allergies to sulfonamide are common. According to data {{the overall}} {{incidence}} of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. It {{is important to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.|$|E
25|$|In Christian faith, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between: (a) preambles {{of faith and}} (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.|$|E

25|$|Stone {{and bone}} needles found in ancient tombs led Joseph Needham to {{speculate}} that acupuncture might {{have been carried out}} in the Shang dynasty. This being said, most historians now <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between medical lancing (or bloodletting) and acupuncture in the narrower sense of using metal needles to treat illnesses by stimulating specific points along circulation channels ("meridians") in accordance with theories related to the circulation of Qi. The earliest evidence for acupuncture in this sense dates to the second or first century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Hispanophone and Hispanosphere are terms used {{to refer}} to Spanish-language {{speakers}} and the Spanish-speaking world, respectively. The terms derive from the Latin political name of the Iberian Peninsula, Hispania. In addition to the general definition of Hispanophone, some groups in the Hispanic world <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between Castilian-speaking and Spanish-speaking, with the former term denoting the speakers of the Spanish language—also known as Castilian—and the latter the speakers of the Spanish or Hispanic languages (i.e. the languages of Spain or the languages of the Hispanic nations).|$|E
25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds {{as long as we}} are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1916, {{the type}} was called Schneider CA 1 to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> with a derived tank project, the Schneider CA 2. In 1917 the Schneider CA 1 is also called the Schneider 1916 to {{distinguish}} it from the Schneider 1917, {{another name for the}} next tank project, the Schneider CA 3. This had its origin in a demand by Estienne on 30 January 1917 to agree on a standardised terminology. General Mourret then proposed to use the official designations Schneider Modèle 1916 and Saint-Chamond Modèle 1916.|$|E
25|$|Companies usually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between {{voluntary}} churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to {{a decision}} by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Norris: The officious, skinflint {{older sister}} of Lady Bertram, {{who lives near}} Mansfield Park. Her husband, Mr Norris, was the parson at Mansfield Park until his death. She dislikes Fanny and takes every {{opportunity}} to put her down and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between Fanny's treatment and that of her wealthier cousins. Mrs Norris also takes every opportunity to save money, such as taking jellies and sewing materials from the main house for her own home. Historian and biographer Jon Spence suggested in Becoming Jane Austen that Mrs Norris was based on Austen's sister-in-law Mary Lloyd, who had married James Austen, and who was the younger sister of Austen's close friend Martha Lloyd.|$|E

The first dimension <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between sound {{emanating from the}} fictional game world, such as the footsteps of a game character, and sound coming from outside the fictional game world, such as a musical score. Stockburger (2003) describes this distinction by using the terms diegetic and non-diegetic. The second dimension <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between sound related to {{the activity of the}} game on one hand, and sound related to the setting of the game on the other.|$|R
