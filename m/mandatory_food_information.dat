Food Handler Certification provides food handlers with knowledge to control factors that may contribute to foodborne illnesses. Food Handler Certification is mandatory in a number of provinces in Canada as well as several states in the United States. This study compared two groups of food establishments, one with <b>mandatory</b> <b>Food</b> Handler Certification for staff and management and one without. Establishments in which Food Handler Certification was mandatory were 1. 97 times less likely to receive infractions during inspections (P = < 0. 0000001; OR: 1. 97, 95 % C. L: 1. 54 – 2. 50). The types of infractions commonly noted during inspections between the two study groups were similar, but the <b>mandatory</b> <b>Food</b> Handler Certification group had fewer infractions noted during inspections in almost all of the infraction categories, indicating that Food Handler Certification should be implemented in all food establishments because it has a positive effect on inspection scores.

40|$|Objective : To {{identify}} {{challenges in}} translating scientific evidence of a  nutrient and health relationship into <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification policy. Design : A case study approach {{was used in}} which available evidence  associated with the folate–neural tube defect relationship was reviewed against the Australia New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council 2 ̆ 7 s Policy Guideline for <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification. Results : Three particular challenges were identified. The first is knowing {{when and how to}} act in the face of scientific uncertainty. The second is knowing how to address the special needs of at-risk individuals without compromising {{the health and safety of}} the population as a whole. The third is to ensure that a policy is sufficiently monitored and evaluated. Conclusions : Despite the availability of compelling evidence of a relationship between a particular nutrient and a health outcome, a definitive policy response may not be apparent.   Judgement and interpretation inevitably play significant roles in influencing whether and how authorities translate scientific evidence into <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification policy. In relation to the case study, it would be prudent to undertake a risk–benefit analysis of policy alternatives and to implement nutrition education activities to promote folic acid supplement use among the target group. Should mandatory folate fortification be implemented,  comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of this policy will be essential to know that it is implemented as planned and does more good than harm. In relation to <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification policy-making around the world,  ongoing national nutrition surveys are required to complement national policy guidelines. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} book {{presents a}} {{critical analysis of}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification as a technology for protecting and promoting public health. Increasing numbers of foods fortified with novel amounts and combinations of nutrients are being introduced into the food supplies of {{countries around the world}} to raise populations’ nutrient intakes. Three topical food fortification case studies representing the different public health rationales for adding nutrients to food were assessed for their public health benefits, risks and ethical considerations: Universal salt iodisation (USI) to help prevent iodine deficiency disorders; mandatory flour fortification with folic acid (MFFFA) to help prevent neural tube defects; and mandatory milk fortification with vitamin D (MMFVD) to help prevent vitamin D deficiency. These assessments found that whereas USI performs strongly as a public health intervention, MFFFA and MMFVD are associated with more risks and less ethical justification than an alternative policy option. Food fortification can be a blunt policy response to complex policy problems. The findings highlight that the primary predictor of a <b>mandatory</b> <b>food</b> fortification policy’s benefits, risks and ethics is its ability to address the underlying cause of the policy problem. The analysis of the policy-making processes for each case study found that certain powerful actors use their influence to determine what counts as evidence in policy processes to privilege food fortification activities over alternative policy options. Policy-making frequently was notable for the low prominence it afforded ethical considerations and its lack of public engagement. Priority activities to help strengthen policy processes and outcomes are suggested. <br /...|$|R
