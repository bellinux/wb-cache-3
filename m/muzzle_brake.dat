5|$|M3A1 (1942) - {{version with}} {{threaded}} barrel end {{to accept a}} <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake,</b> which was never issued.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> Other sources mention the <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and the barrel of the M-10 (which was fitted with a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} reduce recoil, jump and flash {{and act as}} a base for {{optional}} iron sights and suppressors.|$|R
50|$|The State of California outlaws flash {{suppressors}} on semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines, but allows <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> {{to be used}} instead.|$|R
50|$|Overall length: S18-1000 and −1100 85-inch. This could vary due to {{a number}} of {{optional}} <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> used for different projectile weights.|$|R
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake,</b> with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
50|$|WASR-series rifles are {{inexpensive}} and easily customized, {{with hundreds of}} aftermarket stocks, <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes,</b> flash suppressors, telescopic sights, and other accessories available.|$|R
50|$|The sniper rifles are {{normally}} fitted with <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> to reduce recoil, jump and flash. The Sako factory TRG <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> vent sideways and are detachable. Generally TRGs are {{outfitted with a}} Zeiss or Schmidt & Bender PM II telescopic sight with fixed power of magnification or with variable magnification. Variable telescopic sights can be used if the operator wants more flexibility to shoot at varying ranges, or when a wide field of view is required.|$|R
50|$|Flash {{suppressors}} and <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> can {{be legally}} acquired and used on {{all types of}} weapons, unless {{they are designed to}} significantly or predominantly reduce the sound.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the F-25, the M-30 was not {{equipped}} with a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> While softening recoil and thus allowing for a lighter carriage, the <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> has a disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel toward the ground where they raise dust, revealing the gun's position. Another side-effect of a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> is the increased muzzle blast behind the gun, adversely affecting the working conditions of its crew.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its {{eventual}} successor, the D-1, the M-10 was {{not equipped}} with a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> While softening recoil and thus allowing lighter carriage, a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> has the disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel toward the ground where they raise dust, revealing the gun position.|$|E
25|$|M26A1. M3A1 {{gun with}} bore {{evacuator}} and single-baffle <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
50|$|Barrel length: 51-inch <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> length: 1-hole brake, 1 inch; 4-hole, 4 inches; 5-hole, 5 inches. The brake adds to {{the overall}} length of the barrel when installed.|$|R
50|$|The first IG 42s were {{delivered}} in October 1944 equipped with <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes.</b> It {{is unclear how}} many were taken into service {{until the end of}} the war.|$|R

25|$|Equipment {{supplied}} with the Tantal includes: three spare magazines, a 6H4 type bayonet with scabbard, bipod, four 15-round stripper clips (they enable rapid magazine charging), a stripper clip guide, cleaning kit, sling, magazine pouch and a lubricant bottle. The weapon's <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> {{can also be}} replaced with a blank firing adaptor for use with blanks during training exercises.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{supplied}} 24 howitzers to Finland {{for use in}} the Winter War of 1939–1940. Finland obtained 30 {{more from}} Spain in July 1940 and all guns were used in the Continuation War of 1941–1944. It was designated 114 H/18 in Finnish service. The Finns fitted a perforated cylindrical <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> Some of the guns were used in the BT-42 self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E
50|$|Other, more {{contentious}} modifications are version specific <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{which are}} designed to prevent the barrel from rising (and consequently ruining the sight picture of the shooter), as well as lessening the recoil felt while shooting.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, AAC {{was awarded}} a $14,201,731 {{contract}} for the <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> that they produce known as the [...] "Brakeout". This contract was procured via the Navy Electronic Commerce and Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division.|$|R
50|$|MAS10 is a {{division}} under evaluation, {{and sort of}} a crossover between MAS and MAO, being limited to iron sights only, a magazine capacity of 11 rounds (10 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber) and factory fitted <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> only.|$|R
25|$|A boxy, boat-shaped vehicle, the EE-9 Cascavel has a steep frontal glacis which slopes upwards {{and back}} towards the {{horizontal}} hull roof, with recesses for the headlamps and a thick glacis plate over the driver's seat. The hull sides are nearly vertical, but also sloped inwards towards the roof. There is a low, well-rounded turret on the forward section of the hull with a long, tapered gun barrel and a triple baffle <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the gun's {{development}} by the Germans is contradictory in the available sources. Hogg claims that the K 39/40 had only slight changes made, but that the K 39/41 added a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake</b> to control recoil. Gander and Chamberlain say that the K 39/40 and K 39/41 both had muzzle brakes with better performance than the original K 39 and that the K 39/41 was introduced to simplify production. Sixty were built for the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{precision}} rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with {{a similar}} operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a flash suppressor and a <b>muzzle</b> <b>brake.</b> It can be replaced with a sound suppressor, which {{requires the use of}} subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|... Portugal {{adopted a}} version of the M1A2 as the Dilagrama m/65 for use with the FN FAL or H&K G3 rifles. They did not need the grenade {{launcher}} bracket because it was built into the weapons' <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> as part of a NATO STANAG requirement.|$|R
50|$|The Open {{division}} allows optical sights, <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes,</b> and detachable magazines {{or the use}} {{of speed}} loaders for internal magazines. Magazines must not contain more than 10 rounds at the start signal. Bipods are also permitted, and the shotgun {{does not have to be}} factory produced.|$|R
5000|$|In recent {{developments}} in the start of 2013, the police and people from the airsoft communities have exchanged words and {{are now in a}} negotiation to legalize the sport provided the players make their units (AEGs or GBBRs) distinctive from a real firearm through the use of orange tipped <b>muzzle</b> <b>brakes</b> ...|$|R
