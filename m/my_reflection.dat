5|$|My Kind of Christmas {{received}} generally mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics, who criticized its musical style, {{as well as}} Aguilera's vocal delivery. The album peaked at number 28 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold 1,015,000 copies there. Aguilera appeared on several television shows, such as The Early Show and The David Letterman Show, to promote the album, and also performed a special concert for ABC, which was released on DVD in June 2001, as <b>My</b> <b>Reflection.</b>|$|E
500|$|Aguilera {{performed}} the song on television four times, {{first on the}} CBS This Morning, {{and then on the}} Donny & Marie show; neither of these performances were directed at her demographic of teen viewers. Whilst watching the show on This Morning, Aguilera gained the attention of songwriter Diane Warren, who was astonished by such a young performer being as [...] "polished" [...] as she was. Warren later stated that she had seen the potential in Aguilera. The singer also performed [...] "Reflection" [...] on MuchMusic's Intimate and Interactive on May 17, 2000. An ABC special in 2000, featuring a performance of the song, was recorded and released in a DVD titled <b>My</b> <b>Reflection.</b>|$|E
500|$|In December 2000, {{she held}} a one-hour special show on ABC and {{performed}} [...] "Falsas Esperanzas", it was later recorded in a video release entitled <b>My</b> <b>Reflection.</b> Aguilera also gave a performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards in February, performing [...] "Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti" [...] and [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine called Aguilera's Grammy performance [...] "remarkably mainstream". [...] During her 2003 Justified and Stripped Tour, her first co-headlining tour with Justin Timberlake, she performed a medley of [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] and [...] "Contigo en la Distancia". At {{the end of the}} performance, a male dancer ripped off the skirt she wore, revealing [...] "tiny" [...] denim shorts underneath. Later, she [...] "saucily" [...] replied, [...] "Just because my album name is Stripped, doesn't mean you can take my clothes off". She also performed the medley during the tour's extension, The Stripped Tour in late 2003; it was later included in the DVD release Stripped Live in the U.K..|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 24, 2000, by RCA Records as Aguilera's third studio album in the United States, following her two first albums Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000). It was released as two formats: CD and cassette. In order to promote the album, Aguilera promoted the album {{on a number of}} shows, including The Rosie O'Donnell Show, The Early Show, and David Letterman Show. On December 10, 2000, Aguilera performed [...] "The Christmas Song", [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] and [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] during a concert at Franklin High in Milwaukee, being watched by 1,300 students. She also performed during an ABC special concert later in December; the set list included songs from her three first studio albums, including a song from My Kind of Christmas, [...] "Have Yourself A Little Merry Christmas". There, she performed the track with Brian McKnight. The concert was filmed and released as a DVD entitled <b>My</b> <b>Reflection</b> (2001).|$|E
500|$|The lead single of {{album was}} [...] "Ven Conmigo (Solamente TÃº)", the Spanish version of [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)", which was {{released}} on August 8, 2000 to Latin radio stations. The song reached number-one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs and number two on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs charts. It also peaked at number eight in Spain.

500|$|... "Lotus Intro" [...] is an {{electronic}} music song which lasts for a duration {{of it was}} inspired by Aguilera's passion for electronica. It has a [...] "hypnotic" [...] yet [...] "dark, serious" [...] tone which develops and matures as it progresses, depicting Aguilera's rebirth, similar to {{the life cycle of}} a Lotus Flower. The track opens with tribal chant by Aguilera, who sings the line [...] "Rise up lotus, rise/ This is the beginning" [...] over a [...] "heavy" [...] hip hop beat. Aguilera sings the lyrics [...] "I look at <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> and embrace the woman I've become/ The unbreakable lotus in me, I now set free" [...] over electronic [...] "bleeps and beeps". Some of the opening lyrics, including [...] "Rise up/ This is the beginning" [...] and [...] "Leave the past behind", serve as a mission statement {{for the rest of the}} album. Despite claiming to [...] "submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces" [...] and [...] "leave the past behind/ say goodbye to the scared child inside," [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard felt that the singer [...] "still has a few scores to settle." [...] According to Robert Copsey for Digital Spy, the singer explains how the a Lotus Flower is [...] "the unbreakable flower" [...] in the lyrics [...] "To the sky I rise/ Spread my wings and fly". He further wrote that the listener could be fooled by the title [...] "Lotus Intro", as it is a full length song and not a short introduction. Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post was critical of Aguilera's vocal performance, writing that although the singer's strength is her voice, she sounds [...] "modulated beyond recognition".|$|E

2500|$|Gnarls Barkley {{described}} the Violent Femmes' version as: [...] "I might {{compare it to}} a calm pond. I caught <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> in it. And I seemed to be momentarily at peace.

[...] The Violent Femmes hosted a YouTube contest beginning June 10, 2008, with a cash award of $1,000USD and [...] "other cool prizes" [...] for creating and submitting a promotional video clip.|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>reflections</b> are of {{the same}} kind; {{and if they are}} {{unlogical}} they are perhaps not the less comfortable. Fretting and struggling does no good. Wrote to Miss Margaret Ferguson a letter of condolence.|$|R
60|$|More {{thoughtful}} than usual, I walked on, passing {{some of my}} old haunts, and {{was about}} to turn in front of a feed and grain store when a hearty slap on my back disturbed <b>my</b> <b>reflection.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He smiled sadly, {{and shook}} his head. [...] "They were rash words, Agostino. I mistook ignorance for purity--a common error. I have pondered it since, and <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> brings me to utter what in this {{household}} amounts to treason." ...|$|E

6000|$|All {{these things}} do I now think over, adding, [...] "He had his faults, yet scarce ever was a finer nature; liberal, suave, impressible." [...] <b>My</b> <b>reflections</b> closed in an audibly {{pronounced}} word, [...] "Graham!" ...|$|R

60|$|Ramiro grew impatient, and <b>my</b> <b>reflections</b> {{suffered}} interruption by his rough {{command that}} I should hasten. One of the men-at-arms {{helped me to}} truss my points, and when that was done I stepped forward--Boccadoro the Fool once more.|$|R
60|$|It was winter, and frost was on {{the window}} that day. I enjoyed the crisp air, for I was packed warm in lamb's-wool underneath. There I stood, my father's round red face beaming {{on one side of}} the table, my mother's smiling but enigmatic, scrutinizing <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> on the other, and myself tippeting this way and that--a veritable {{miniature}} of Vanity.|$|E
60|$|I went to Clark's office, {{found he}} had left, and {{followed}} him to his rooms. The minute I saw him I experienced the same nasty feeling of lost or bewildered individuality which always overcame me in his presence. He was so absurdly like me. I felt as if I were looking into a mirror where <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> persisted in doing things I didn't do, thereby producing a most uncanny sensation.|$|E
6000|$|You will easily believe I {{was well}} {{qualified}} for a pirate that could talk thus. But let me leave it upon record, for the remark of other hardened rogues like myself,--my conscience {{gave me a}} pang that I never felt before when I said, [...] "What signifies thinking of it?" [...] and told me I should one day think of these words with a sad heart; but the time of <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> was not yet come; so I went on.|$|E
60|$|This was {{precisely}} what had formed {{the subject of}} <b>my</b> <b>reflections.</b> Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the rÃ´le of Xerxes, in CrÃ©billon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that what}} you've {{come to me}} now for," [...] I asked, [...] "is to speed me on my way?" [...] Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check. [...] "I've a better idea--the result of <b>my</b> <b>reflections.</b> <b>My</b> going WOULD seem the right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won't do. It's YOU who must go. You must take Flora." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have already}} {{mentioned}} that Lucilla and I had idled away the whole afternoon, woman-like, in talking of ourselves. You will best understand what course <b>my</b> <b>reflections</b> took, if I here relate the chief particulars which Lucilla communicated to me, concerning her own singular position in her father's house.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure that I should not have known myself, master, if I had looked into a horse trough and seen <b>my</b> <b>reflection.</b> It {{will be a long}} time before I shall be able to persuade myself that these clothes are my own, and that I really am an officer's lackey. Now, master, you must teach me my duties, of which I know nought when in a house like this, though I know well enough what they are when you are in the field." ...|$|E
60|$|I can {{perfectly}} recall my childish {{figure as}} I stood with endless satisfaction surveying <b>my</b> <b>reflection</b> in a looking-glass on the Christmas morning after my ninth birthday. My frock {{was of a}} fine puffed scarlet, my slippers loose at heel, to match. My hair, demurely parted in the middle, hung straight on my narrow shoulders (though I had already learned to plait it) and so framed my face; the eyebrows faintly arched (eyebrows darker and crookeder now); the nose in proportion; the lips rather narrow, and of a lively red.|$|E
60|$|The truth is, when real revulsions of {{body and}} soul come, they come in a gush, all at once. Fleming, on the Night, was {{actually}} putting the last touches to my coiffure when suddenly, with a wicked curse, I turned from the great glass and announced my decision. Tiny tortoiseshell comb uplifted, {{she stood in the}} clear lustrousness looking in at <b>my</b> <b>reflection,</b> queer thoughts darting about in her eyes. At first she supposed it was but another fit of petulance. Then her hatred and disgust of me all but overcame her.|$|E
60|$|My self-communion as I {{walked away}} from his door, trying {{to believe that this}} was for the last time, was not satisfactory. I was aware myself that I was not sincere in <b>my</b> <b>reflections</b> as to Jacobus's motives, and, of course, the very next day I went back again.|$|R
60|$|Was this {{resolution}} solely inspired by {{my interest in}} Lucilla? Or had my own curiosity been all the time working under the surface, and influencing the course of <b>my</b> <b>reflections</b> unknown to myself? I went to bed without inquiring.

40|$|Reading Kahneman 2 Ì 7 s {{book and}} {{thinking}} about a tribute to Ed Cooper that has more substance than a bouquet have caused me to reflect on a phenomenon within the world of legal scholarship. I would call it a cognate phenomenon, but that would dishonor the empirical basis of Kahneman 2 Ì 7 s work by suggesting a firmer basis for <b>my</b> <b>reflections</b> than the power of analogical reasoning. The phenomenon is {{the view that the}} goal of legal scholarship is or should be big ideas, particularly if they can claim the mantle of theory, rather than small ideas, particularly if they can be tarred with the feathers of doctrine. <b>My</b> <b>reflections</b> about this phenomenon and the work and career of Ed Cooper led me to the title of this essay...|$|R
