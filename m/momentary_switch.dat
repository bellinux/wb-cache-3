5000|$|Due to the {{electromagnet}} in the contactor, if {{power to}} the machine should fail the contactor will automatically disengage. Unlike machines with an ordinary latching switch (such as a common light switch), when the power is resumed the machine will not operate until being turned on again. As a result, magnetic starters often use <b>momentary</b> <b>switches</b> for [...] "off" [...] and [...] "on" [...] functions, as this type of switch returns to a defined normal position when released. Latching switches do not have this feature and therefore are normally not used with a magnetic starter.|$|R
5000|$|This latch {{configuration}} is {{a common}} idiom in ladder logic. In ladder logic it {{is referred to as}} seal-in logic. The key to understanding the latch is in recognizing that [...] "start" [...] switch is a <b>momentary</b> <b>switch</b> (once the user releases the button, the switch is open again). As soon as the [...] "run" [...] solenoid engages, it closes the [...] "run" [...] NO contact, which latches the solenoid on. The [...] "start" [...] switch opening up then has no effect.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the rear}} of the DX-7 is a small patch bay {{providing}} various input and output jacks. These include two jacks for a piano damper pedal-style <b>momentary</b> <b>switch</b> pedal (one for portamento, an effect that makes one note [...] "glide" [...] up or down in pitch to the next note, and a second jack for sustain, which holds any notes that the performer was pressing at the time she/he depresses the sustain pedal); two expression pedal jacks for modulation and volume (loudness and softness); and an output jack, which can be connected to a keyboard amplifier and loudspeaker, PA system or sound recording system. All of the jacks on the patch bay are standard 1/4" [...] jacks. The external pedals must be purchased separately. For the output jack, the performer needs a standard 1/4" [...] patch cord.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of energy safety has been a paramount subject matter. This we can see in todays electrical systems where protective devices such as fuse and circuit breakers are used to prevent fire hazards resulting from overload overvoltage and short circuits. However with all the revolution in technology these options may be considered less smart since the fuse made with wire strands calculated for specific current capacity faults permanently when the specified current rating is exceeded. While the circuit breaker which {{is made up of}} mechanical switch fails as a result of carbon forming and the wearing away of the contacts because of arcing. As a means of improvement this paper presents the design and development of an automatic single phase protective device using solid state relay SSR. This study is to ensure automatic cut off from power supply in cases of overvoltage above 240 V AC or when overload and short circuit current above 8 amps is detected without permanent damage of a fuse placed along current path. Also the design will ensure that there is an automatic close circuit whenever the trigger switch is <b>momentary</b> <b>switch</b> is closed. The system is achieved via the use of PIC micro-controller current sensor and other discrete components. The system is tested and works well inhibiting the frequent faulting of fuses. It also helps to prevent hazard as a result of overvoltage overload and short circuit and ensures a close circuit when the trigger switch is closed...|$|E
40|$|A circuit {{that changes}} an {{electrical}} load in a switching time shorter than 0. 3 microsecond has been devised. This circuit {{can be used}} in testing the regulation characteristics of power-supply circuits. especially switching power-converter circuits that are {{supposed to be able to}} provide acceptably high degrees of regulation in response to rapid load transients. The combination of this power-switching circuit and a known passive constant load could be an attractive alternative to a typical commercially available load-bank circuit that can be made to operate in nominal constant-voltage, constant-current, and constant-resistance modes. The switching provided by a typical commercial load-bank circuit in the constant-resistance mode is not fast enough for testing of regulation in response to load transients. Moreover, some test engineers do not trust the test results obtained when using commercial load-bank circuits because the dynamic responses of those circuits are, variously, partly unknown and/or excessively complex. In contrast, the combination of this circuit and a passive constant load offers both rapid switching and known (or at least better known) load dynamics. The power-switching circuit (see figure) includes a signal-input section, a wide-hysteresis Schmitt trigger that prevents false triggering in the event of switch-contact bounce, a dual-bipolar-transistor power stage that drives the gate of a metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), and the MOSFET, which is the output device that performs the switching of the load. The MOSFET in the specific version of the circuit shown in the figure is rated to stand off a potential of 100 V in the "off" state and to pass a current of 20 A in the "on" state. The switching time of this circuit (the characteristic time of rise or fall of the potential at the drain of the MOSFET) is. 300 ns. The circuit can accept any of three control inputs. which one depending on the test that one seeks to perform: a repetitive waveform from a signal generator, momentary closure of a push-button switch, or closure or opening of a manually operated on/off switch. In the case of a signal generator, one can adjust the frequency and duty cycle as needed to obtain the desired AC power-supply response, which one could display on an oscilloscope. <b>Momentary</b> <b>switch</b> closure could be useful for obtaining (and, if desired, displaying on an oscilloscope set to trigger on an event) the response of a power supply to a single load transient. The on/off switch can be used to switch between load states in which static-load regulation measurements are performed...|$|E
