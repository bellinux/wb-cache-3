500|$|In June 2011, Levine {{took part}} in an {{educational}} campaign {{to raise awareness of}} Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project, titled [...] "Own It", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with it as a teenager, said, [...] "This campaign is important to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid". In connection to this, he wrote an article in ADDitude Magazine about his personal experience with it.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Gould {{published}} The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating {{his version of}} modern evolutionary theory. In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{finished}} script was {{submitted to the}} Sebor-Bor production company, it was approved at first, {{only to have the}} chief of the script department pronounce it the dullest thing he'd read in years and urge Forman not to proceed with the project, since it would spoil the good reputation the director had established with Black Peter. In Forman's words: [...] "It wasn't arty enough, but, on the other hand, it didn't have enough commercial appeal either. It would offend and irritate the public, he told <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> made fun of the common man, who would be disgusted by it." [...] Despite this objection, Vlastimil Harnach, the head of the studio, approved proceeding with the film in part because, due to the political and cultural thaw in Czechoslovakia at the time, decision makers were anxious to avoid the appearance of overt administrative interference in the creative process.|$|E

Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E

500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for <b>me.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer.

2500|$|Acting on a {{proposal}} by Minister of Education Letizia Moratti, on 14 December 2005, the President of the Italian Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, awarded Fallaci a Gold Medal for her cultural contributions (Benemerita della Cultura). The state of her health prevented her from attending the ceremony. She {{wrote in a}} speech: [...] "This gold medal moves <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> gratifies my efforts as writer and journalist, my front line engagement to defend our culture, love for my country and for freedom. My current well known health situation prevents me from traveling and receiving in person this gift that for me, a woman not used to medals and not too keen on trophies, has an intense ethical and moral significance".|$|E

She played basketball her freshman year as a guard for the Brown Bears, but after her mother died during her sophomore year, she decided to spend a year studying abroad in Australia. It was during that year abroad that she decided to pursue a coaching career seriously. Gottlieb explained, [...] "I knew that it was the perfect thing for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> combined kind of my nerdiness and love of the X's and O's with the ability to impact 18- to 22-year-olds in a really significant way.

She expresses that she would like to see more young talents develop in the right direction by helping them to cultivate their love for playing music.

[...] Lynch also talked about her career plans and legacy: [...] "I know I want to do something with children. [...] I haven't really found my direction, with everything I've been through...

It is painful, a trying task to submit to a separation from a man I have loved so long and so much; but I must submit to it, for I will not abandon my character to the disgraceful imputations that must attach upon it if I do not justify it by charging him with the most shameful dereliction of his friend that ever was experienced by a faithful and a tried one.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contribution}} in music came after she met William Orbit {{at a party}} and tried to beg a cigarette from him. They began a relationship shortly after, and he encouraged her to do some spoken word for his Strange Cargo project and to sing.

It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William pulled me out of the crowd and pulled me out of the gutter, in a way.

2500|$|Clooney {{was raised}} a strict Roman Catholic, but said in 2006 {{that he does}} not know if he {{believes}} in Heaven, or even God. He has said, [...] "Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group." [...] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade. In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that [...] "yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed." [...] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: [...] "It's probably a great thing that it happened to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lowenthal's {{first major}} role in video game voice-overs was as the Prince in Ubisoft's [...] In an {{interview}} with Critical Gamer, he describes that role as [...] "a very lucky break for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> ended up being a super game. We audition all the time for {{all different kinds of}} projects, and videogames are one part of that, a part that I love." [...] He said that [...] " [...] that [...] in a way originated that role". Lowenthal did not return to voice the Prince in Warrior Within, being replaced by Robin Atkin Downes. Lowenthal felt that this was a conscious decision by Ubisoft to fit in with the game's overall tonal shift, and thought it was the right decision. For The Two Thrones, he returned to play the role, as fans had stated their preference for his portrayal of the character. The Prince became one of Lowenthal's favorite roles, and he was pleased to return to the role for The Forgotten Sands. According to Lowenthal, his well-received performance put pressure on him in future games from both fans and staff, as he needed to remain true to and improve on his original portrayal. This ultimately gave him little creative freedom with the character after The Sands of Time. For the reboots following the live-action films, the staff wanted a different portrayal of the Prince to Lowenthal's, and so recast the role.|$|E
