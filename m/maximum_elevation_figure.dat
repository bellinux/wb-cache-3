50|$|On Canadian IFR High- and Low-Level charts, area minimum altitudes (AMA) are {{published}} for quadrangle areas, which provide a buffer beyond the VFR <b>maximum</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>figure.</b> The AMA {{is the lowest}} off-airway altitude to be used under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) that will provide a minimum vertical clearance of 1,000 feet (AGL), or in designated mountainous terrain 2,000 feet above all obstacles located in the area specified, rounded up to the nearest 100 foot increment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>figure</b> or MEF {{is a type}} of VFR {{altitude}} {{which indicates}} the height of the highest feature within a quadrangle area. It is of interest to pilots, who want {{to be aware of the}} highest mountain peaks and tall towers nearby, so that they can fly above them to avoid controlled flight into terrain. ("Features" [...] includes terrain, trees, towers, and other obstacles.) In a VFR context, this altitude is commonly referred to as a [...] "quadrantal altitude" [...] (not to be confused with an IFR minimum sector altitude or [...] "quadrantal" [...] altitude.) ...|$|E

50|$|Pilotage in the United States {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} {{with the use}} of sectional charts, which show the ground with considerable accuracy, both for terrain levels and for man-made objects. The charts are marked with World Geographic Reference System or GEOREF grids, and at the center of each grid square a number shows the elevation (MSL) of the highest obstacle within that grid (the <b>maximum</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>figure</b> or MEF). Thus a pilot is alerted of how high he must fly while traversing that grid to assure clearance of all possible obstacles. Then {{it is up to the}} pilot to select a cruising altitude which will provide the required clearance above those obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{a simpler}} {{solution}} would be to consult an almanac giving the time of sunrise and sundown, calculate the middle point of that time-span, corresponding to the <b>maximum</b> <b>elevation</b> of the sun.
