30|$|Summarizing, the {{illumination}} setup {{featuring the}} <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp and the incandescence lamp seems {{the best to}} be employed for the acquisition of large painted surfaces. However, it must be considered that halogen lamps {{have a number of}} practical advantages over incandescence bulbs, as they are more energy-efficient, produce a higher light intensity with the same power, and last more. For all these reasons, in on-field applications it is more feasible to use halogen lamps. We have therefore considered the combination of the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> and the incandescence lamps a sort of ideal case, which has been validated in the acquisition of three paintings performed in a controlled environment (see Section 5.1). On the contrary, for on-field acquisitions we have chosen to use the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp in combination with the halogen lamp.|$|R
30|$|For the {{laboratory}} acquisitions, {{we have chosen}} the best-performing illumination setup, consisting of the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp and the incandescence lamp used in a sequence.|$|R
30|$|During the acquisitions, we {{have set}} the camera {{exposure}} time and shutter aperture so as {{to have a strong}} signal in the blue region when using the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp. This has caused the signal to saturate in the 530 – 680 [*]nm interval (Figure 4 (a)). However, as we will see, this spectral window will be discarded for the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp. A zoom of the emission spectrum of the same lamp in the blue region can be seen in Figure 4 (b).|$|R

Both illumination configurations have therefore been validated in laboratory and in-field conditions. The combination of <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> and incandescence lamps has been deployed for the acquisition of three paintings from Italian contemporary artists in a controlled environment. The setup featuring the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> and halogen lamps has then been used for the on-field acquisition of {{a large portion of}} a fresco of the Castello del Buonconsiglio in Trento (Italy).|$|R
30|$|The two {{combined}} setups can {{be considered}} as a particular kind of bracketing [47], a high dynamic range imaging technique where acquisitions taken at different exposure times are combined to achieve better reconstruction results. The use of two different lamps for the acquisitions (first the saturated <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp, then the halogen or incandescence lamp) is preferable both to the use of two different exposure levels for the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp, and to a double acquisition with one of the broad spectrum lamps. Obtaining a sufficiently strong signal in the red and blue regions, respectively, would require very long exposure times. As a consequence, the dark current contribution would be increased [48], and the acquisition times would become too long.|$|R
30|$|When {{using the}} {{combined}} setups, a scaling has been performed {{in order to}} eliminate the discontinuity between the reflectance acquired with the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp and that measured with the other lamp. This scaling is always performed when measuring real reflectances, therefore the corresponding performance characterization results are meaningful.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{application}} for these compounds is {{as a component}} of perovskite (structure) crystalline solar cells. The iodide is the most commonly used. When complexed with other <b>metallic</b> <b>iodides</b> such as tin iodide or lead iodide it {{can be used as a}} light gathering compound in place of naturally occurring organic dyes, providing excellent bandgap and charge mobility. Other methylammonium halides such as the chloride and bromide can be used instead of, or as minor substituents to, methylammonium iodide, providing the ability to tune the absorption, conductivity, and apparent bandgap.Magnetic ion doping like manganese results in a magnetic photoconductive material which opens avenues for magneto-optical data storage based on this material.|$|R

3000|$|Large-sized {{pictorial}} surfaces such as frescoed rooms {{or great}} paintings represent a relevant aspect of artistic expression. Their acquisition poses different challenges from those encountered when acquiring regular paintings, {{the most relevant}} dissimilarity being that in the former case the illumination sources must be placed far from the acquired scene. Therefore, the instruments and procedures used for the multispectral acquisition of regular-sized paintings are not suited to the acquisition of large surfaces. This paper systematically addresses the issues involved in multispectral acquisition of large-sized painted surfaces. Suitable acquisition instrumentation comprising an IS multispectral camera mounted on a rotatory device is exemplified. As illumination selection {{turns out to be}} a rather critical task, the issue is discussed in detail. We have considered four illumination setups: a halogen lamp alone (the illumination source most commonly used for the multispectral acquisition of paintings), an incandescence lamp alone, and two composite setups comprising a <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp for the measurement of reflectance between 420 and 500 [*]nm, and the halogen or incandescence lamp for recovering the reflectance between 500 and 800 [*]nm. These illumination configurations have been tested on the acquisition of the spectral reflectance of a set of calibrated colored tiles. We have also examined the delicate issue of performance evaluation and defined the error as a function of wavelength, using a metrological procedure to infer the uncertainty of the computed error from the statistics of the measured variables. To quantify the performance of reflectance measurements, we have used the average error (AE) and the average error standard deviation (AESTD), calculated for each illumination setup and averaged over the eight-tile set. Although both the combined illumination setups yield a good performance, the best results have been obtained using the <b>metallic</b> <b>iodide</b> lamp in combination with the incandescence lamp ([...] [...]...|$|R
