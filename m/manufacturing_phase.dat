2500|$|Most LCAs of PV {{have focused}} on two categories: carbon dioxide {{equivalents}} per kWh and energy pay-back time (EPBT). The [...] EPBT is defined as [...] " [...] {{the time needed to}} compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system". A 2015 review of EPBT from first and second generation PV suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in EPBT. One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phase.</b> Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.|$|E

5000|$|Digital Prototyping {{changes the}} {{traditional}} product development cycle from design>build>test>fix to design>analyze>test>build. [...] Instead of needing to build multiple physical prototypes and then testing {{them to see}} if they’ll work, companies can conduct testing digitally throughout the process by using Digital Prototyping, {{reducing the number of}} physical prototypes needed to validate the design. Studies show that by using Digital Prototyping to catch design problems up front, manufacturers experience fewer change orders downstream. [...] Because the geometry in digital prototypes is highly accurate, companies can check interferences to avoid assembly issues that generate change orders in the testing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phases</b> of development. Companies can also perform simulations in early stages of the product development cycle, so they avoid failure modes during testing or <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phases.</b> With a Digital Prototyping approach, companies can digitally test a broader range of their product’s performance. They can also test design iterations quickly to assess whether they’re over- or under-designing components.|$|R

40|$|Clay brick is {{the most}} common {{construction}} material used in the historical buildings of Diyarbakır (Turkey). Many clay brick manufacturing workshops and numerous brick masters have emerged. Diyarbakir currently has two clay brick workshops that face the problem of being closed down. Therefore, manufacturing of clay brick by traditional methods may be forgotten in Diyarbakir. This study investigates the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phases</b> of traditional clay bricks in Diyarbakir׳s local workshops, which have not been documented. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phases</b> of the clay bricks in Diyarbakır were examined for the first time based on in-situ observations, investigations, and interviews. The research indicated the general phases of clay brick manufacturing. Raw materials are first prepared, formed, and dried. The firing of clay bricks is then performed through hacking, heating, burning, cooling, and de-hacking. The clay bricks are finally packaged and dispatched. The traditional manufacturing of clay brick methods in Diyarbakır is similar in many regions of the world. The clay bricks are currently and extensively used in the restoration of historic structures. Therefore, their production must be continuous...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} use {{of electronic}} equipment in {{various aspects of}} modern life has lead to implementation of numerous testing phases during the design, assessment, and manufacture of electronic equipment.

50|$|Some {{microcontrollers}} provide special hardware interfaces which {{cannot be}} used to take arbitrary control of a system or directly run code, but instead they allow the insertion of boot code into bootable non-volatile memory (like flash memory) via simple protocols. Then at the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>phase,</b> such interfaces are used to inject boot code (and possibly other code) into non-volatile memory. After system reset, the microcontroller begins to execute code programmed into its non-volatile memory, just like usual processors are using ROMs for booting. Most notably this technique is used by Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and by others as well. In many cases such interfaces are implemented by hardwired logic. In other cases such interfaces could be created by software running in integrated on-chip boot ROM from GPIO pins.|$|E
