The latter are developing rapidly and constitute a perfectly complementary <b>macromolecular</b> <b>engineering</b> toolbox to the controlled radical polymerization techniques (CRP). Indeed, all structures formed by CRP {{are likely to be}} prone to radical coupling reactions, which multiply the available synthetic possibilities. Basically, the coupling systems can be divided in two main categories. The first one, including the atom transfer radical coupling (ATRC), silane radical atom abstraction (SRAA) and cobalt-mediated radical coupling (CMRC), relies on the recombination of macroradicals produced from a dormant species. The second one, including atom transfer nitroxide radical coupling (ATNRC), single electron transfer nitroxide radical coupling (SETNRC), enhanced spin capturing polymerization (ESCP) and nitrone/nitroso mediated radical coupling (NMRC), makes use of a radical scavenger in order to promote the conjugation of the polymer chains.

40|$|Macromolecular Science 2 ̆ 6 amp; Engineering is the {{paradigm}} of a multi-disciplinary area in Materials Science. The path from monomer via macromolecules into functional polymer materials and products travels through various disciplines: chemistry, catalysis, thermodynamics, <b>macromolecular</b> reaction <b>engineering,</b> rheology, physics, processing and product design. The successful development of novel and/or improved polymeric materials and products from laboratory into industrial practice requires an integrated approach and profound understanding of the various disciplines met en route, viz. the chain-of-knowledge approach.

40|$|<b>Macromolecular</b> <b>engineering</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tool to synthesise many polymers of various architectures and with tailored properties. This contribution aims at reporting on a novel strategy for the <b>macromolecular</b> <b>engineering</b> of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) which is based on the use of a dual monomer / initiator compound, α-chloro-ε-caprolactone (αClεCL). Indeed, αClεCL is not only polymerizable by ring opening initiated by metal alkoxides, but it is also an initiator for the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of vinyl monomers, so leading easily to the synthesis of macromonomers. Polystyrene macromonomer has been prepared by this method and successfully copolymerized with ε-caprolactone (εCL) with formation of the corresponding grafted PCL. αClεCL is also a precursor of copolyesters with εCL that bear pendant chlorides. These (co) polyesters have been used as macroinitiators for the ATRP of methyl methacrylate in order to synthesise the corresponding graft copolymer. On the other hand, the pendant chlorides of poly(αClεCL-co-εCL) copolyesters were easily converted into azide with formation of the corresponding azide bearing copolyester. This copolyester was then reacted with an alkyne bearing an ATRP initiator by “Click chemistry”. The conversion of chlorides into more efficient ATRP initiators led to the improvement of the initiation efficiency of the macroinitiator...|$|E
