6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she suggested, [...] "you {{can find}} some way of keeping it, and yet keeping it without that {{secondary}} dishonour you spoke of. Now I must really go and see that <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> behaving properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The villains," [...] {{continued}} Macgregor, [...] "think we've {{given up}} pursuit as hopeless, but they're mistaken--they're mistaken, as they'll find to their cost. Now, mark me, men; we shall turn {{back as if}} we had really given in; but the moment we get down into the hollow, out of sight, we'll go as hard as we can bolt up that valley there, and round by the place we call the Wild-Cat Pass. It's a difficult pass, but who cares for that? Once through it we can get by a short cut {{to the other side of}} that wood, and meet the redskins right in the teeth. They're Blackfoot Indians, I know by their dress; and, as they don't belong to this part o' the country, they can't be aware of the pass. But some of us must go back a good way towards the fort, so as to deceive the blackguards, who'll be sure to get on the first hill they can to see where we've gone to. Now--away! Stay," [...] he added in a less commanding tone, [...] "I don't know that <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> willing to go with us through thick an' thin in this fashion. I've no desire to have unwilling warriors." ...|$|E

60|$|However, {{only one}} or two of <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> ever bold enough to stay and eat a hasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis {{approaching}} they beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its foundations.

5000|$|Sue’s {{last years}} were spent in social isolation, shunned from both Charleston’s {{aristocracy}} and her extended family. Her marriage to Bowen, a man considered a thief, murderer, bigamist and traitor, {{was too much}} for even her few remaining supporters - aunt Adèle and sister Caroline - to bear. All ties were severed. Her daughter became her “worst enemy” and “bitterest foe.” Sue wrote that [...] "of what constitutes ‘society,’ I have none. My parties are all given by myself: <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are,</b> for the most part, old & poor & forlorn - less friendless perhaps than I, but a great deal more destitute than I ever was.” [...] Yet, unlike the rest of her family, Sue’s postwar years were spent in relative luxury, her husband having procured a fine mansion in a tony Charleston neighborhood, {{less than a mile from}} Sue’s childhood home on Broad Street. When she died of typhoid pneumonia in December, her legal will mysteriously disappeared, along with her remaining jewelry. Within a year, Bowen was remarried to the eighteen-year-old daughter of South Carolina’s Radical Republican governor, Daniel Henry Chamberlain.|$|E
40|$|For {{this project}} I {{produced}} and hosted a 30 -mintue in-depth interview/talk show program where I interviewed three {{students about the}} process of going through graduate school at Western Kentucky University. Two of <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> currently going through graduate school at WKU while the third recently received his graduate degree. I discussed with each guest their respective fields and area of research. We talked not only about why they chose their field but how their work and their field affect society on a daily basis. We touched on the that impact at the local and national level. My goal for anyone viewing this show is to expand their knowledge about the process that students go through who attend graduate school, both the challenges and rewards...|$|E

60|$|I tore downstairs, {{jumped into}} the waiting taxi and {{returned}} to the Milan. I entered the private room with a grave face. Evidently I was only just in time.

60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} {{recovered}} I had great trouble to keep off the men, {{who wished to}} ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, {{in a state of}} body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.

50|$|<b>Be</b> <b>My</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>is</b> {{an early}} Australian {{television}} series, which aired weekly on Melbourne station HSV-7 from 30 January 1957 to 24 April 1957. Episodes were 15 minutes in duration (following a 15-minute newscast), and hosted by Eric Pearce. It was likely an interview series, but {{little is known}} about it, and it is not known if any kinescope recordings were made of it. However, despite its obscurity, it is notable as an early example of Australian-produced television content.|$|R
