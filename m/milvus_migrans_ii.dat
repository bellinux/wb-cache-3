Conversely, in the Central Mediterranean the migration of this species is scarce during the supposed peak pe-riod, while hundreds of individuals are observed migrating later in the season, mostly in April and May. In the present study we investigate the spring migration of Black Kites at two sites of the Central Mediterranean, the island of Ustica and the Strait of Messina.

One of the primary goals was the creation of distribution maps of breeding records based on definitive time and space coordinates. Additional data on the breeding biology amend the distribution data. Currently 43 raptor species are recorded for Mongolia. Whenever possible were also incorporated data from adjacent regions of Mongolia (China, Tuva, Burjatia, Pribaikalia), in order to embed the avifauna of Mongolia into this wider geographical setting.

40|$|The post-fledging {{dependence}} {{period of}} 15 radio-tagged juvenile Black Kites <b>Milvus</b> <b>migrans,</b> was {{studied in the}} Donana Biological Reserve (Spain). The juveniles fledged at {{a mean age of}} 48 days after hatching and continued to depend on their parents for 15 –¸ 36 days more. During the whole period a progression was observed in the flight behaviour of the young, as an increase of both the total time spent flying and the use of more elaborate and energy-saving flight types such as gliding and soaring. Neither hunting nor manipulative play behaviour with objects was observed, although pursuits were recorded and considered as social play. Migratory restlessness seems to shorten the post-fledging dependence period as the season progresses. Juvenile departure was sudden and definitive, and family ties always broke before migrationPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Numerous {{native species}} have been {{reported}} as successfully preying on toads. Some birds, such as the black kite (<b>Milvus</b> <b>migrans),</b> have learned to attack the toad's belly, avoiding the poison-producing glands {{on the back of}} the head. Anecdotal reports in the Northern Territory suggest that a native frog, Dahl's aquatic frog (Litoria dahlii), is able to eat the tadpoles and live young of the toad without being affected by the poison that often kills other predators. This may account for slower than expected infestations of toads in certain areas of the Northern Territory, although later research carried out jointly by several Australian Universities casts doubt on these reports. Some snakes {{species have been}} reported to have adapted smaller jaws so that they are unable to swallow large cane toads which have large quantities of poison.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of homeothermy {{was investigated in}} a hand-reared black-eared kite, <b>Milvus</b> <b>migrans</b> lineatus. The 20 -day-old nestling was capable of thermoregulating at about 95 % of the adult ability at the ambient temperature of 20 ℃. In effect, the kite {{which is one of}} large altricial birds acquires the homeothermy in an earlier growth stage than do small altricial ones, Such precocious {{development of}} homeothermy in the kite appears to be caused by the large body mass resulting in decreased surface to volume ratio and in increased heat production, and it allows the parents to increase the foraging time early in the nestling period. In other words, the precocious development of homeothermy plays an important part in the growth and survival of the kite nestling which requires more food and energy than do the nestlings of small altricial birds...|$|R
40|$|Scavenging {{birds are}} very {{conspicuous}} in Kampala {{and a number}} of counts have been made of their numbers since the 1970 s. Between the 1970 s and mid- 2000 s the breeding population of Marabou Storks Leptoptilos crumeniferus increased from about 100 pairs to nearly a thousand, whilst roost counts of Black Kites <b>Milvus</b> <b>migrans</b> also showed large increases. Numbers of Pied Crows Corvus albus and Hooded Vultures Necrosyrtes monachus, also counted as they came into communal roosts, showed lower rates of increase; from mid to late 2000 s however, Hooded Vultures seem to be decreasing. These increases perhaps reflect the four-fold increase in the human population over the same period, considerably adding to the refuse upon which these birds mainly feed. In view of alarming declines of scavengers elsewhere, especially vultures, we plan to continue monitoring these Kampala birds...|$|R
40|$|Black kites of {{the nominal}} {{subspecies}} <b>Milvus</b> <b>migrans</b> migrans breed in the Western Palearctic and in Central Asia, while the European population is relatively small.

At that time regular wintering of black kites started there.
