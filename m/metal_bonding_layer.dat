Single-layered <b>metal</b> <b>bond</b> diamond {{wheels are}} useful to high {{efficient}} grinding of difficult-to-grind materials {{because of the}} high gripping force of abrasive grains and the controllable grain density.

SDC grains jump into a <b>metal</b> <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> as quick as making an electrostatic field, however SD grains jump with short time lags. The setting rate of SDC grains is larger than that of SD grains, and setting position accuracy of SDC grain array is better than SD grain array.

From the experimental results, decrease of fatigue of thermal-barrier-coated SUS 304 was observed under triangular strain wave as {{compared with that of}} the base metal. On the other hand, fatigue life of the coated one under trapezoidal wave was same as that of the uncoated one. Difference of fatigue life between coated and uncoated material was explained by crack initiation behavior, which was obtained by A. C. potential method and observation by optical microscope. The number of cycles to crack initiation of coated specimen under triangular wave is smaller than that of uncoated one.

The effects of the heated water environments on the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> between the CFRP and concrete beams were evaluated by quantifying: (1) the changes of delaminations within the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer,</b> (2) the changes in resistance to direct shear force and (3) the changes of failure mode distribution. Before the exposure, the condition of the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> was inspected by infrared thermography (IRT). After exposure, the deterioration of the same <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> and failure mode distributions were measured by analyzing the visual photos on the failed CFRP strips. The failure modes were found to be affected largely by the combined effect of elevated temperature and moisture ingress, in which three types were identified: failure at concrete beams, at adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> and interface between CFRP strip and concrete. With these methods, results of 54 specimens show that the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layers</b> of all the specimens had gradually deteriorated in the 40 °C and 60 °C water baths.
