5|$|In 1136, {{the rival}} of Anacletus, Pope InnocentII, {{convinced}} LothairIII, Holy Roman Emperor {{to attack the}} Kingdom of Sicily {{with help from the}} Byzantine Emperor JohnII Comnenus. Two main armies, one led by Lothair, the other by Duke of Bavaria Henry the Proud, invaded Sicily. On the river Tronto, William of Loritello surrendered to Lothair and opened the gates of Termoli to him. This was followed by Count HughII of <b>Molise.</b> The two armies were united at Bari, from where in 1137 they continued their campaign. Roger offered to give Apulia as a fief to the Empire, which Lothair refused after being pressured by Innocent. At the same period the army of Lothair revolted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molise</b> DOC - This large DOC {{covers the}} entire mountainous <b>Molise</b> region located south of Abruzzi.

25|$|The {{language}} of <b>Molise</b> Croats belongs to Western Shtokavian dialect of Ikavian accent, with many features and lexemes of Chakavian dialect. The lexicon comparison {{points to the}} similarity with {{language of}} Sumartin on Brač, Sućuraj on Hvar, and Račišće on Korčula, settlements founded almost {{in the same time}} as those in <b>Molise,</b> and together point to the similarity of several settlements in South-Western and Western Istria, formed by the population of Makarska hinterland and Western Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|According to {{evidence}} <b>Molise</b> Croats {{arrived in the}} early 16th century. The documents from the episcopal archive of Termoli indicate that <b>Molise</b> Croats arrived 1518 in Stifilić (San Felice). A stone inscription on the church in Palata, destroyed in 1930s, read Hoc Primum Dalmatiae Gentis Incoluere Castrum Ac Fundamentis Erexere Templum Anno 1531 (Residents of Dalmatia first settled the town and founded the church in 1531). The absence of any Turkish word additionally proves this dating.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, Graziadio Isaia Ascoli {{considered}} that around 20,000 residents of <b>Molise</b> region were of Slavic origin. This figure {{is considered to}} be unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Major Slavic colonies were in Friuli, Veneto, Marche, Sicily and {{throughout}} the Kingdom of Naples (including Apulia, <b>Molise,</b> Abruzzo, Calabria, Terra di Lavoro and Campania).|$|E
25|$|Other {{varieties}} that are sometimes confused with Carignan {{but have been}} conclusively proven by DNA analysis to be distinct include the Sardinian wine grape Nieddera that {{is related to the}} Pascale di Cagliari grape which also grown on the island and sometimes confused with Carignan, Cinsault which shares the synonym Samsó in Catalonia with Carignan, the Italian wine grape Tintilia del <b>Molise</b> that is grown in the Lazio and <b>Molise</b> wine regions of central Italy and the Spanish wine grape Parraleta that is grown in the Somontano DO of Aragon.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} <b>Molise</b> {{settlements}} are Italianized Acquaviva Collecroce (Živavoda Krȕč), Montemitro (Mundìmītar), San Felice (Stifìlīć > Fìlīć). Toponymy includes several semantic categories; {{characteristics of the}} ground (Brdo, Dolaz, Draga, Grba, Kraji, Livade, Polizza, Ravnizza, Vrisi), soil composition (Stina, Drvar), hydronyms (Vrila, Jesera, Jaz, Locqua, Potocco, Coritti, Fontizza), flora (Dubrava, Valle di Miscignavizza, Paprato, Topolizza), fauna (Berdo do kujne, Most do tovari), position of the object (Monte svrhu Roccile, Fonte donio, Fonte zdolu Grade), human activitiy (Gradina, Ulizza, Puč, Cimiter, Selo, Grad, Stasa), and property owners (Maseria Mirco, Colle di Jure). The toponymy of <b>Molise</b> is almost identical to the toponymy of Makarska Riviera.|$|E
25|$|The {{variant of}} Abruzzo and <b>Molise,</b> also called bilancia, often insists on {{shallower}} coasts and therefore {{is characterized by}} the presence of a platform, transversal to the coast, which is connected by a tight bridge made of wooden boards. A bilancia has just one winch, often electrically operating, even when the sea is perfectly calm. Abruzzo bilancia has also a net much smaller than that of Gargano trabucco, another feature that differentiates the two types is the length and number of antennae, more extensive Gargano (also double that of Abruzzo and <b>Molise)</b> in Termoli balances were more than two antennae, Gargano always two or more.|$|E
25|$|Serafino Razzi in {{his work}} Cronica Vastese (1576–1577) wrote that the Slavs who came across the sea founded in <b>Molise</b> region {{settlements}} San Felice, Montemitro, Acquaviva Collecroce, Palata, Tavenna, Ripalta, San Giacomo degli Schiavoni, Montelongo, San Biase, Petacciato, Cerritello, Sant'Angelo and Montenero di Bisaccia. Other Slavs settled in Vasto, Forcabobolani, San Silvestro, Vacri, Casacanditella, Francavilla al Mare, and in Abruzzo among others. For the Slavic congregation in Rome was established Illyrian brotherhood of St. Jerome, which was confirmed by Pope Nicholas V in 1452. Slavs founded fifteen settlements in <b>Molise,</b> according Giacomo Scotti with around seven or eight thousand people, of which only three (San Felice, Montemitro, Acquaviva Collecroce) today have a Slavic-speaking community.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} {{exposure to}} the disintegration processes and Italian foreign language surrounding, as well absence of cultural institutions, resulted {{with the loss of}} ethnic identity. The ethnic identity of <b>Molise</b> Croats consists of common language, personal names and toponyms, common customs (living and dressing), as well oral tradition of migration. In 1904 was founded Slavenska knjižnica (Biblioteca Slava) in Acquaviva Collecroce, from 1968 was released journal Naš jezik, and again between 1986–1988 as Naš život in Slavomolisano dialect. From 2002 is released journal Riča živa. Local amateur associations preserve the tradition, folklore and language. In 1999 was founded Foundation Agostina Piccoli, which in 2002 was officially recognized by Italy as institution for preservation and protection of <b>Molise</b> Croats culture and tradition.|$|E
25|$|Guiscard {{was a major}} castle-builder {{after his}} {{accession}} to the Apulian countship, building a castle at Gargano with pentagonal towers known as the Towers of Giants. Later, Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo built a castle at nearby Castelpagano. In the <b>Molise</b> the Normans built many fortresses into the naturally defensible terrain, such as Santa Croce and Ferrante. The region of a line running from Terracina to Termoli has the greatest density of Norman castles in Italy. Many sites were originally Samnite strongholds reused by the Romans and their successors; the Normans called such a fortress a castellum vetus (old castle). Many Molisian castles have walls integrated into the mountains and ridges, {{and much of the}} quickly erected masonry demonstrates that the Normans introduced the opus gallicum into the <b>Molise.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{escaping}} from {{the trap of}} Ager Falernus by winning the Battle of Ager Falernus, Hannibal, with his army and spoils, marched east toward <b>Molise.</b> Still committed to a delaying strategy, Fabius followed Hannibal cautiously, keeping to the high ground and avoiding being drawn into a pitched battle at all cost.|$|E
25|$|It is {{bordered by}} the other Italian regions of <b>Molise</b> to the north, Campania to the west, and Basilicata to the southwest. Across the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, it faces Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, and Montenegro, The Apulia region extends {{as far north as}} Monte Gargano. Its capital city is Bari.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Giuseppe Maria Galanti {{in his work}} Descrizione dello stato antico ed attuale del Contado di <b>Molise</b> (1781), as Schiavoni {{settlements}} considered Acquaviva Collecroce (1380 pop.), Montemitro (460), San Siase (960), San Felice (1009), Tavenna (1325), and noted that the residents of Ripalta (781) spoke equally poorly Slavic and Italian.|$|E
25|$|The net {{is lowered}} into the water through a complex system of winches and, likewise, {{promptly}} pulled up to retrieve its catch.

25|$|After leaving Ager Falernus {{through the}} pass of Callifae, Hannibal retraced his steps, moving east towards <b>Molise.</b> The Carthaginian army, {{encumbered}} with plunder and herds of cattle, moved slowly, seeking {{a place to}} set up their winter quarters. Fabius and the Romans dogged the Carthaginians from a distance and avoided direct confrontation with them. Hannibal marched north to Venefram, which caused alarm in Rome as that city {{was thought to be}} the Carthaginian objective. Then the Carthaginian army suddenly turned east into Samnium, and after crossing the Apennine Mountains and moving through the Pelignial plains, finally entered <b>Molise.</b> Fabius continued to follow Hannibal, and when the Carthaginians reached near the modern-day village of Casacalenda and took over a town named Geronium, Fabius set up his camp at Larinum, 20 miles to the south. The Carthaginians had cut a swath of destruction in their march, ravishing farms and property, collecting provisions and prisoners as they moved, unopposed by Fabius.|$|E
25|$|Gofri (singular gofre) are waffles in Italy and can {{be found}} in the Piedmontese cuisine: they are light and crispy in texture, contain no egg or milk (according to the most ancient recipe) and come both in sweet and savory versions.

25|$|The {{conquest of}} the <b>Molise</b> is poorly documented. Boiano (the {{principal}} town) may have been conquered {{the year before the}} Battle of Civitate by Robert Guiscard, who had encircled the Matese massif. The county of Boiano was bestowed on Rudolf of Moulins. His grandson, Hugh, expanded it eastward (occupying Toro and San Giovanni in Galdo) and westward (annexing the Capuan counties of Venafro, Pietrabbondante and Trivento in 1105).|$|E
25|$|A rich {{array of}} kinship names (including vlah, fiancé, and vlahinja, fiancée), and many lexemes {{indicate}} {{that among the}} population of <b>Molise</b> Croats were genuine Vlachs communities. It has been preserved the tradition of nickname Mrlakin (Morlak) and old homeland for the Mirco family. On the Vlachian influence point forms Mrlakina, Jakovina, Jureta, Radeta, Peronja, Mileta, Vučeta, Pavluša, patronyms with suffix -ica (Vučica, Grgorica, Radonjica, Budinica), name suffix -ul (Radul, Micul), and verb čičarati.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo (Abruzzi) is an Italian wine region {{located in}} the mountainous central Italian region of Abruzzo along the Adriatic Sea. It is bordered by the <b>Molise</b> wine region to the south, Marche {{to the north and}} Lazio to the west.

The Veneti, most often regarded as an Italic tribe, chiefly inhabited the Veneto, but extended as far east as Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Istria, and had colonies as far south as Lazio.|$|E
25|$|In the peninsula, {{alongside}} the Etruscans, lived numerous tribes, mostly of Indo-European origin: the Umbri in Umbria and northern Abruzzo, the Latins, {{who created the}} Roman civilization, Sabellians, Falisci, Volsci and Aequi in the Latium; Piceni in the Marche and north-east Abruzzo; Samnites in southern Abruzzo, <b>Molise</b> and Campania; Daunians, Messapii and Peucetii (forming the Apulian or Iapygian confederation) in Apulia; Lucani and Bruttii in the southern tips of the peninsula.
