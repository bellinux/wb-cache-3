40|$|Upper {{urinary tract}} {{complications}} {{have been reported}} in about 20 - 30 % of spinal cord injury patients. Their pathogenesis is linked to the presence of high-pressure uninhibited detrusor contractions, high leak point pressure and low bladder compliance. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the incidence of upper urinary tract complications in two homogeneous groups of spinal cord injury patients with different bladder emptying modalities (intermittent catheterization vs. tapping, abdominal straining, Crede's manoeuvre) and the relationship with clinic and urodynamic features. A total of 17 patients (22 %) had upper urinary tract complications. The incidence of both urinary tract dilatation and vesicoureteral reflux was significantly lower in patients having intermittent catheterization (P = 0. 03 and 0. 04 respectively). Intermittent catheterization thus seems to be effective in preventing upper urinary tract disease in spinal cord injury patients requiring <b>mechanical</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying modalities. The finding of upper urinary tract complications also in patients having intermittent catheterization showing high intravesical pressures stresses the need of adding anticholinergic medications to the rehabilitation regimen of these patients...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of norfloxacin {{was determined to}} maximize the correlation between susceptibility testing of the drug {{and the results of}} clinical therapy of urinary tract infection in diabetics. This study was carried out to observe the effect of changing concentration of norfloxacin on the growth of uropathogens under diabetic conditions. METHODS: The standard broth microdilution method was carried out to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using Mueller Hinton broth by varying pH of the medium (5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5 and 7. 0) and glucose concentration (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/dL). A specially designed <b>mechanical</b> <b>bladder</b> model system simulating hydrokinetic conditions that exist in the urinary tract of diabetics was employed. RESULTS: The loss of activity of norfloxacin was more pronounced (> four folds) at pH 5. 0 and 2000 mg/dL sugar concentration. These findings were consistent with the experiment &#x 2032;in vitro simulated bladder model&#x 2032; by exposing bacterial growth to varied norfloxacin and sugar concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Although norfloxacin is a drug of choice for non-diabetic and diabetic individuals with mild to moderate glucosuria, in severe diabetic individuals norfloxacin may not be an effective drug...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A biomechanical {{model was}} {{constructed}} to {{give insight into}} pelvic organ motion {{as a result of}} bladder filling changes. Methods: The authors used finite element (FE) modeling to simulate bladder wall deformation caused by urine inflow. For ten volunteers, a series of MRI scans of the pelvic area was recorded at regular intervals of 10 min over 1 h. For the series of scans, the bladder volume gradually increased while the rectal volume was constant. The MR image with the bladder volume closest to 250 ml was selected as the reference in each volunteer. All pelvic structures were defined from the reference image including bladder wall, small bowel, prostate (male), uterus (female), rectum, pelvic bone, {{and the rest of the}} body. These structures were translated to FE meshes. Using appropriate material properties for all organs, deformations of these organs as a response to changing bladder pressure were computed. Results: The computation results showed realistic anisotropic deformation of the bladder wall: The bladder became more elongated in the cranial and anterior directions with increasing bladder volume. After fitting the volume of the computed bladder to the actual bladder volume on the test images, the computed bladder shape agreed well with the real bladder shape (overlap from 0. 79 to 0. 93). The average mean bladder wall prediction errors of all the volunteers were 0. 31 cm average and 0. 29 cm SD. Conclusions: In conclusion, a FE based <b>mechanical</b> <b>bladder</b> model shows promise for the prediction of the short-term bladder shape change using only one pelvic scan and volume change of the bladder as input. The accuracy levels achieved with this method are likely mostly limited by inaccuracies in material properties and sliding tissue between organs, which has not been modeled. This model can potentially be used to improve image-guided radiotherapy for bladder cancer patients, i. e., by prediction short-term bladder deformation.

Both filling and voiding are strongly influenced by <b>bladder</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties that are in turn dependent on the bladder specific wall architecture. In this work, we focus on an experimental approach for obtaining data for modeling the collagen fiber contribution in structurally motivated models of the bladder wall.

40|$|Consideration of {{the problem}} of {{reducing}} the probability of <b>mechanical</b> failure of <b>bladder</b> systems used for the expulsion of propellants into liquid rocket engines. It is shown that individual local folds in collapsing bladders can be classified into single and double folds, specifiable by nondimensional geometrical parameters which directly define the maximum strains at these folds. From these maximum strains the number of collapse/inflation cycles to failure can be obtained from low-cycle fatigue data experimentally determined for the bladder material of interest. Cycle life data are presented in terms of true maximum strain for four metals, two plastics, and two elastomers. It is found that double folds give rise to much more severe folding strains than do simple folds...|$|R
30|$|Results: 190 {{patients}} received antibiotics. Its prescription incidence was 53.37 %. The {{average length}} of hospitalisation was 18.45  days. Antibiotic therapy was started before admission in 42.10 % of patients. After admission, 53.37 % of patients received antibiotic therapy. Curative antibiotic therapy was probabilistic in 90.5 % of cases based on clinical, biological, radiological and ecological arguments. 6.3 % of initial prescriptions were directed to bacteriological results and 3.2 % of initial prescriptions were prophylactic. The infection was predominantly respiratory infections (62.10 %), but nosocomial infection accounted for 37.89 %. Third generation cephalosporins represented the most frequently prescribed molecules (73.68 % of cases) followed by quinolones and aminoglycosides. 41.6 % of patients received monotherapy, while 58.4 % of patients received a combination of antibiotics. The mean duration of curative antibiotic therapy was 5.67  days. The most frequently isolated seeds in the samples were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Progression with antibiotics was favorable in 57.9 % of patients. The prognosis in univariate analysis depended on the severity scores on admission (APACHE II, SAPS II, SOFA), intubation <b>mechanical</b> ventilation, <b>bladder</b> sampling, antibiotic pre-treatment, nosocomial infection {{and nature of the}} germ—ESKAPE pathogens. In multi-variate analysis of APACHE II score, SOFA score, pathogens and nosocomial infection were associated with significant excess mortality.|$|R
40|$|The {{urinary bladder}} stores urine and permits proper micturition, both {{functions}} that are inherently <b>mechanical.</b> <b>Bladder</b> research {{to date has}} been limited to whole-organ testing and simple uniaxial study, {{both of which are}} inadequate for comprehensive modeling and rigorous analysis of the mechanical properties of the bladder wall. In this work, we studied the quasi-static and time-dependent properties of the bladder wall to further understand bladder function. To obtain the requisite multiaxial data we utilized biaxial testing techniques, which allow for a more realistic physiological loading state. The goal {{of the study was to}} develop a comprehensive understanding of bladder wall biomechanics to provide insight into tissue-level bladder function. This information can be compared against other ongoing and future studies of pathologies to aid in the design of clinical treatments. The results indicated that bladder tissue 10 days after spinal cord injury was more compliant than normal bladder when referenced to the preconditioned state. However, the preconditioned state itself was different between normal and spinal-cord-injured groups, indicating large rapid changes in structure. There was a fundamental change in material behavior after spinal cord injury that indicates structural rearrangement on a microstructural fiber level. Unlike other soft tissues, there was no difference in mechanical response over three orders of magnitude of loading strain rate, most likely due to the large range of bladder function, including fast emptying and very slow filling. The time-dependent stress relaxation tests indicated that bladder behavior was dependent on stress level, with less relaxation occurring at higher stress levels. This may be because the massive structural rearrangements during normal function cause more collagen to bear load at higher stress levels as protection from over distention. This study provided the first mechanically rigorous information regarding the tissue properties of the normal bladder wall, including comparisons to a diseased state. This information can be used to understand how differences in structure caused by disease alter the tissue behavior, and hence the biological function, of the urinary bladder...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} mechanical {{model of}} the LHC Nb/sub 3 /Sn quadrupole magnet structure has been designed, built and tested. The structure will support a 90 mm bore, lm long magnet prototype {{as part of the}} US LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP). The structure utilizes Bladder and Key Technology to control and transfer pre-stress from an outer aluminum shell to an inner coil. Axial aluminum rods take care of pre-stress at the ends-ensuring that the coil is fully constrained along all three axes. The outer aluminum shell and an inner "dummy coil" (aluminum tube) were extensively instrumented with strain gauges. The gauges were used to monitor and map the effectiveness of the stress relation between the loading structure and a "dummy" coil through varying <b>mechanical</b> load conditions-from <b>bladder</b> and key pre- stress at room temperature through cool-down.

40|$|Background/Aims: Overactive bladder {{associated}} with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) {{is a highly}} prevalent condition, which is usually treated with antimuscarinics. However, the potential effects of antimuscarinics on the structure and function of bladder have not been investigated thus far. Methods: Sprague-Dawley(R) rats accepted bladder neck obstruction surgery or sham surgery, and then received treatment of three different antimuscarinics (Solifenacin, Darifenacin, and Tolterodine) or vehicle. After 3, 6 and 12 weeks, the bladder function and structure were measured. The effect of antimuscarinics on cellular alteration in vitro was observed under <b>mechanical</b> stimulation. <b>Bladder</b> morphology were examined by immunohistochemistry, and the bladder function were investigated by cystometry and strip contractility test. The expression of muscarinic receptors and inflammatory cytokines were measured by PCR and Western blotting. Results: Here we demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that antimuscarinics are protective regulators for the bladder structure and function. Antimuscarinics decrease the weight of bladders with BOO. Antimuscarinics improve the voiding parameter and enhance the contraction of bladder smooth muscle. The results also show that antimuscarinics inhibit the proliferation of bladder smooth muscle cells both in vivo and in vitro, it can reduce the collagen deposition and inflammatory cytokines in bladders with BOO. During this process, the expression of M 2 and M 3 receptors was altered by antimuscarinics. Conclusion: Antimuscarinics could reverse the structural and functional changes of BOO bladder wall at cellular and tissue level, and the alteration of M 2 and M 3 receptors {{may be involved in}} this biological process...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} passive {{mechanical properties}} of the bladder need to be known in order to design the most appropriate long-term surgical repair procedures and develop materials for bladder reconstruction. This study {{has focused on the}} bladder tissue viscoelastic behavior, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of fibers orientation, strain rate and loading history. Whole bladders harvested from one year old fat pigs (160 kg approximate weight) were dissected along the apex-to-base direction and samples were isolated from the lateral region of the wall, as well as along apex-to-base and transverse directions. Uniaxial monotonic (stress relaxation) and cyclic tests at different frequencies have been performed with the Bose Electroforce® 3200. Normalized stress relaxation functions have been interpolated using a second-order exponential series and loading and unloading stress-strain curves have been interpolated with a non-linear elastic model. The passive <b>mechanical</b> behavior of <b>bladder</b> tissue was shown to be heavily influenced by frequency and loading history, both in monotonic and cyclic tests. The anisotropy of the tissue was evident in monotonic and in cyclic tests as well, especially in tests performed on an exercised tissue and at high frequencies. In contrast, transverse and apex-to-base samples demonstrated an analogous relaxation behavior...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeAcute {{urinary bladder}} {{distension}} (AUBD) can activate <b>bladder</b> <b>mechanical</b> afferent and renal sympathetic nerves, which contributes to renal vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that AUBD-induced renal sympathetic activation {{may contribute to}} inflammatory responses and end-organ damage via activation of angiotensin-II-receptor-mediated intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression and leukocyte infiltration in the kidney. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of 2 hours of AUBD induced by a threshold volume (micturition volume) on renal oxygen tension, microcirculation, renal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and monocyte/ macrophage (ED- 1) infiltration, and ICAM- 1 expression in the kidneys of urethane-anesthetized female Wistar rats. Bilateral ureteral dissection, renal denervation and intrarenal angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (2 mg/kg valsartan) {{were used to determine}} their roles in AUBD-induced renal oxidative stress. ResultsOur results showed that AUBD evoked hypertension, a reduction in cortex oxygen tension and microcirculation, and increased renal ROS production, which were caused by increased perivascular and interstitial monocyte/macrophage infiltration and endothelial ICAM- 1 overexpression. Renal denervation and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, but not bilateral ureter dissection, abolished the reduction in cortex oxygen tension and microcirculation, increased renal ROS production, increased perivascular monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and led to endothelial ICAM- 1 overexpression in the kidney. ConclusionAcute urinary retention enhances renal sympathetic activity, which causes renal vasoconstriction and increases oxidative stress, adhesion-molecule expression and leukocyte infiltration in the rat kidney via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor pathway...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to have better {{targeting}} of the prostate during radiotherapy {{it is necessary to}} understand the <b>mechanical</b> interactions between <b>bladder,</b> rectum, and prostate and estimate their consequences on prostate motion. For this, the volumes of bladder, rectum, and lungs were modified concomitantly on a deceased person. A CT acquisition was performed for each of these different pelvic configurations (36 acquisitions). An increase in the volume of the bladder or lungs induces a compression of tissues of the pelvic area from its supero-anterior (S-A) to infero-posterior (I-P) side. Conversely, an increase of rectum volume induces a compression from the I-P to the S-A side of the pelvic region. These compressive actions can be added or subtracted from each other, depending on their amplitudes and directions. Prostate motion occurs when a movement of the rectum is observed (this movement depends, itself, on lungs and bladder volume). The maximum movement of prostate is 9 mm considering maximal bladder or rectal action, and 11 mm considering maximum lung action. In some other cases, opposition of compressive effects can lead to stasis of the prostate. Based on the volumes of bladder, rectum, and lungs, it is possible to qualitatively estimate the movement of organs of the pelvic area. The best way to reduce prostate movement is to recommend the patient to have an empty rectum, with either full bladder and/or full lungs...|$|R

40|$|Capsaicin {{desensitization}} {{leads to}} behavioral changes, {{some of which}} are related to schizophrenia, but investigations into these effects have been scarce. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the consequences of juvenile capsaicin desensitization on different functions: acute and inflammation-induced thermal and <b>mechanical</b> sensitivity, urinary <b>bladder</b> capacity and thermoregulation, and also on the potentially schizophrenia-related impairments in sensory-motor gating, motor activity and cognitive functioning. Male Wistar rats desensitized with increasing doses of subcutaneous capsaicin after weaning were investigated. Heat and mechanical pain sensitivity did not change significantly; however, morphine produced a prolonged decrease in the nociceptive response to inflammation in desensitized animals. Ultrasound examination of the bladder revealed enhanced bladder volume in treated animals. Capsaicin-treated animals had higher body temperature at 22 degrees C in both dark and light periods, and they also showed prolonged hyperthermia in new environmental circumstances. Warm environment induced a profound impairment of thermoregulation in desensitized animals. The treated animals also showed higher levels of activity during the active phase and at both cool and warm temperatures. The amplitude of the responses to auditory stimuli and prepulse inhibition did not differ between the two groups, but the desensitized animals showed learning impairments in the novel object recognition test. These results suggest that juvenile capsaicin desensitization leads to sustained changes in several functions that may be related to schizophrenia. We propose that capsaicin desensitization, together with other interventions, may lead to an improved chronic animal model of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that bladder wall tissue in spinal cord injury (SCI) rats at 10 days post-injury is more compliant and accompanied by changes in material class from orthotropic to isotropic as compared to normal tissue. The present study examined the long-term effects (3 -, 6 -, and 10 -weeks) post-SCI on the <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>bladder</b> wall tissues, along with quantitative changes in smooth muscle orientation and collagen and elastin content. Bladder wall compliance (defined as det(F) - 1 under an equi-biaxial stress state of 100 kPa, where F is the deformation gradient tensor) {{was found to be}} significantly greater at 3 - and 6 -weeks (0. 873 +/- 0. 092 and 0. 864 +/- 0. 112, respectively) when compared to the normal bladders (0. 260 +/- 0. 028), but at 10 weeks the compliance reduced (0. 389 +/- 0. 061) to near that of normal bladders. This trend in mechanical compliance closely paralleled the collagen/elastin ratio. Moreover, changes in material class, assessed using a graphical technique, correlated closely with quantitative changes in smooth muscle fiber orientation. The {{results of the present study}} provide the first evidence that, while similarities exist between acute and chronic responses of the urinary bladder wall tissue to SCI, the overall alterations are distinct, result in profound and complex time dependent changes in bladder wall structure, and will lay the basis for simulations of the bladder wall disease process...|$|R
40|$|By {{the use of}} a {{modified}} electro-magnetic uroflowmeter of our own make the instantaneous flow rate of urine was measured accurately and recorded. Simultaneously with this, a direct cystometry (suprapubic) was performed; recording was made of the intravesical pressure during emptying of the bladder and values for PB /F 2 (PB : intravesical pressure at peak flow) calculated, which were considered to represent the urethral resistance. Discussions were made on the urodynamic significance of the urethral resistance PB /F 2, and various questions arising as to its correct determination were also discussed. The exit pressure was neglected which was regarded as atmospheric pressure, and, an adapter was connected to the transducer of the electromagnetic uroflowmeter to neglect the effect of the vena contracta. Determinations were made of the above mentiond parameters on 33 male controls as well as 29 males with <b>mechanical</b> obstruction of <b>bladder</b> outflow. The following results were obtained. 1) For normal males the average flow rate (AFR) was 3. 4 ~ 18. 8 ml/sec with an average of 9. 2 ml/sec. The peak flow rate (PFR) ranged from 21 to 49 ml/sec, averaging 32. 7 ml/sec. The peak flow pressure (PFP) was 5 ~ 62 mmHg, 30. 7 mmHg on the average. The urethral resistance (R) was O. 0028 ~O. 0689, averaging 0. 0313 mmHg/(ml/sec) 2. 2) In the group of patients with difficult urination due to mechanical obstruction values for each of the 4 parameters were found well correlated with the severity of the disorder which was classified clinically into 4 stages according to the average amount of residual urine. The urethral resistance (R), among the said parameters, is considered to serve as an important index for the quantitative evaluation of the degree of bladder outlet obstruction, showing a particularly distinct correlation with the clinical stages of the disorder...|$|R
