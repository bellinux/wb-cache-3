40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) is often {{considered as a}} cost-effective and risk-reducing source for development finance. This paper, however, shows that FDI finance often entails underestimated risks and costs. FDI might react sensitively to business cycles and {{might not be as}} "permanent" as conventionally believed. FDI might also accelerate other forms of capital flow in times of financial difficulties and, hence, destabilize financial order. In addition to the risks, compensations to FDI and the high import-dependency of FDI-related trade lead to a considerable drain on the balance of payments. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> foreign capital for development finance is equivalent to building a Ponzi financing scheme and, therefore, is unsustainable. Given the fact that FDI financing is risky and costly and China does not lack savings, it is suggested in the present paper that China's efforts in attracting FDI should not aim at external capital provisioning.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} journal papers in which a new segmental moment-rotation (M/Ө) approach is developed for simulating the instantaneous and sustained loading behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with prestressing and external reinforcement. The M/Ө approach is formed on the fundamental Euler-Bernoulli postulation that plane sections remain plane, but not necessarily on the Euler-Bernoulli corollary of a linear strain profile. Further adaption of the well-established mechanics of partial-interaction (PI) theory introduces a fundamental baseline concept in which residual strains due to time-effects, thermal gradients and prestressing are accounted for in simulating the formation and gradual widening of cracks and the associated effects of tension-stiffening allowing for bond-slip. The effects of concrete softening are incorporated into the M/Ө approach through a size dependent concrete stress-strain relationship based on the mechanics of shear-friction theory which simulates the behaviour of a member once a concrete softening wedge forms. The approach is shown {{to be able to}} quantify segmental equivalent flexural rigidities for both instantaneous and time-dependent behaviour, thus removing the reliance on empiricism in quantifying the effects of concrete cracking and softening. In defining the segmental equivalent flexural rigidities of RC beams with both post-tensioned and pre-tensioned reinforcement it is shown how the approach is used to quantify the load-deflection behaviour of the entire member through the application of conventional analysis techniques. The established M/Ө approach is then generically applied to RC beams with both prestressed fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) and steel reinforcement in quantifying the beams instantaneous and sustained loading behaviour through being able to accommodate any conventional method of quantifying the time-dependent parameters. Thus the broad application of the M/Ө approach provides a novel method of simulating, through mechanics, the full-range of behaviour of a prestressed beam, that is from prestress application through serviceability loading and to collapse. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> empiricisms, as typically relied upon in standard analysis methods, are removed with the only empirical components required being in defining the material properties. Having established the M/Ө approach for the instantaneous and sustained loading of conventional prestressed beams, the approach is extended to simulate the behaviour of RC beams with unbonded post-tensioned FRP and steel tendons. Through understanding the individual segmental behaviour, a global approach is introduced in which the behaviour of the unbonded reinforcement can be quantified from the deformation based analysis. The approach is then further extended to incorporate the analysis of RC beams with mechanical-fastened (MF) FRP allowing for the PI behaviour at the fasteners. This extension forms the basis of a generic technique which can subsequently be used in the design of MF systems, with and without prestress, and therefore provide the foundation in developing design guidelines. The universal application of the developed residual strain PI M/Ө approach provides a novel technique in simulating what is observed in practice for RC beams with prestressing and external reinforcement. The approach is a useful extension to the current analysis techniques in which the reliance on defining empiricisms through vast experimental testing procedures is removed. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Between 1946 and 1948, Guatemalan prostitutes {{were hired}} by American medical {{researchers}} {{to engage in}} sexual intercourse with prisoners and soldiers. These women were among the non-consenting and often overlooked subject-groups of the United States Public Health Service's Sexually Transmitted Disease Inoculation Study, a human experiment that tested venereal disease prevention among vulnerable populations. The prostitutes were considered to be, although they were not always in actuality, vectors of disease. Archival material exposed in 2010 by historian Susan Reverby triggered {{a report by the}} United States' Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. As the Commission acknowledged, the USPHS Study in Guatemala is of great contemporary relevance because current public health initiatives, especially in a globalized health economy, raise parallel ethical questions related to foreign drug trials, globalization, and the precarious balance between the advancement of medical knowledge and the protection of individual rights. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>the</b> study's <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> prostitutes draws our attention to the gendered nature of medical experimentation and the unequal power dynamics within clinical settings that leaves certain populations more vulnerable than others. The USPHS researchers justified their presence in Guatemala because of the country's legal prostitution system. Prostitutes themselves, however, were dismissed, neglected, and disrespected. The official records do not simply catalogue which experimental procedures were being used on which institutional populations; they also judge the social, racial, and gender positions of the subjects. Using critical discourse analysis, this thesis compares the researchers' actions and their language. I argue that the researchers were using prostitutes' bodies for supposed disease transmission because of preconceived notions about female sexuality, and infection rates...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how the {{subsidiaries}} {{of multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) reconfigure their resource bases {{to respond to}} an altered strategic positioning. In particular, {{the focus is on}} the subsidiaries of multinational enterprises from emerging economies (EMNEs), which undertake transformation from export-orientation to host market-orientation in an emerging economy being host country. Two Taiwanese MNEs with subsidiaries in China extensively operated the host market are selected as case studies. This research is grounded in a preliminary conceptualisation covering three main areas: subsidiary organisations, external actors in the host country and headquarters’ functions. It provides insights into (1) how the subsidiaries align their historical resources with newly-developed capabilities; (2) how the subsidiaries govern inter-firm relations with external actors in the host environment; and (3) whether and how complementary resources are to a limited extent transferred from headquarters to subsidiaries so as to support the operations in the host market. With regards to the organisational initiatives undertaken by the case subsidiaries, it is found that the historical resources are leveraged to support the host market business, whilst at the same time developing required marketing capabilities. In addition, the concept of organisational ambidexterity is adopted to refer to way in which existing (export-oriented) and new (host market-oriented) businesses that are operating simultaneously. As to the inter-firm relations, the case subsidiaries have been mainly governing their relations with distributors by performance-based mechanisms aiming to secure stable profits. By contrast, the relation-based trust was not commonly observed among the cooperation ties. With growing brand strengths and increased direct contact with consumers, they held higher authority over the interfirm relations with distributors than during the initial stages of operating in the Chinese market. In addition, with regards to the cross-border resource transfers, two distinct modes of headquarters-subsidiary relationships emerged: a traditional one, in which headquarters allocate resources within MNEs and a novel one in which headquarters’ functions were gradually replaced by the powerful subsidiary, termed in this thesis as “migrating headquarters”. On the basis of these findings, we put forward a set of propositions that present the interrelations between the resource circumstances of case subsidiaries, the institutional environments and the organisational initiatives undertaken by the case subsidiaries. Theoretically, the contributions of this study are threefold. Firstly, it advances the research on subsidiary development by holistically exploring the: resource reconfiguration of subsidiaries, inter-firm relations with external actors and headquarters-subsidiary relationships. In particular, the resource deficiency which the EMNEs’ subsidiaries encountered and the characteristics of the required capabilities for the host market-oriented transformation, i. e. local marketing competences, were investigated. Secondly, through probing the governance mechanisms adopted regarding interfirm relations between the case subsidiaries and local distributors, this study not only addresses the question of how MNEs acquire this location-bound resource, but also advances the extant research by the aspect of network positions. That is, this study indicates that the first-tier distributors hold more relations-based interactions with the case subsidiaries than the lower-tier ones did. <b>Moreover,</b> unlike <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> informal relations suggested by extant literature on doing business in emerging economies, it is found that the economic governance mechanisms based on distributor performance have been predominantly adopted by the case subsidiaries. Thirdly, by investigating how the complementary resources are transferred to the subsidiaries, this work discovers EMNEs’ weakness at responding to the host market-oriented subsidiary transformation in terms of resource deployment within MNEs, in particular those resources that have been mostly controlled by headquarters. In addition, the term “migrating headquarters”, which represents an extreme outcome of subsidiary development, provides novel knowledge to the extant literature on the relocation of MNE headquarters by the perspective of resource circumstances. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>the</b> five components comprising dynamic capabilities in the context of subsidiary transformation are identified through the two case studies as being: capability upgrading, capability leverage, capability building, coordination capability and cooperative capability...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> therapy of <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol and its efficiency in biological, {{psychological and social}} aspects. The theoretical part deals with alcohol generally and with the basic conceptions connected with <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol. Further, in the theoretical part, <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol and its therapy is described. In greater detail, I turned to the therapy itself and to {{the description of the}} institutions dealing with the therapy of dependences. In the practical part, I chose the research of quality. I used the method of halfstandardized conversation with abstaining clients of AT institutions. As next research technique, I used the method of observation. I attended the session of <b>the</b> clients with <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol in <b>the</b> programme of follow-up care in the social psycologic centre Arkáda in Písek and the session of anonymous alcoholics. Further, in my research, I used the technique of case-reports for a better presentation of the change of the quality of life due to the therapy of the dependences. The case-reports were interpretted from the resukts of the discussions. The last used method is the reading of professional literature and its presentation in this thesis. The aim of this work is to determine the selected aspects of the therapy effectivenes in AT institutions. The effectivenes is determmined by the change of the state {{from the point of view}} of bio-psycho-social aspects of the clients of AT institutions. The next aim was to evaluate the clients´ satisfaction with the services of individual AT institutions aimed at the fight with <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol and to determine other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol. From my research it resulted, that the therapy of <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol in a specialized institution is a more effective form of <b>the</b> therapy of <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol in an ambulatory establishment and this therapy markedly influences the quality of life of <b>the</b> clients with <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> alcohol and <b>the</b> most effective way is the complex therapy in all items of the therapy of defendences. Further, it was proved, that the situation of the respondents improved in all selected aspects. My research also proved the connection of alcohol with another dependence, mostly on nicotine. Along with this, it confirmed the new trend in the therapy of dependences. i. e. the therapy of dual dependences, from which most of my respondents suffered.
