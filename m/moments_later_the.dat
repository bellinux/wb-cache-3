5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. <b>Moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero dropped to his knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. <b>Moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E
25|$|McCoy {{considered}} Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, {{and attacked}} his experimenter.

As the Planet Express crew huddle in fear of their lives, Fry concludes he has {{somewhat}} succeeded in bringing back the old spirit of Christmas, {{even if it is}} fear that is bringing people together instead of love. At the end of the spree of destruction, Santa tells Bender that if he tries a stunt like that again, he will kill him, and pushes Bender off the sleigh amid the burning buildings.|$|E
25|$|After he {{finished}} reading his poem, a black hood was {{placed over the}} smiling Guiteau's head and <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> gallows trapdoor was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau's body was not returned to his family, as {{they were unable to}} afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried {{in a corner of the}} jailyard. Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E

25|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} sharp crack followed by cessation of {{noise from the}} engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. <b>Moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> wreckage struck the ground and a pall of black smoke rose into the air. Part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, continued to drift down slowly and reached the ground about ¾mile (1.2km) from the main wreckage.|$|E
25|$|Dickerson reprimands Cronauer {{for this}} incident, but his {{broadcasts}} continue. While relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by Tuan, {{who says that}} Trinh wants to see him. <b>Moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; the news is censored, but Cronauer locks himself {{in the studio and}} reports it anyway. Dickerson cuts off the broadcast and Cronauer is suspended. Hauk takes over his shows, but his corny humor and the polka music he plays lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be put back on the air.|$|E
25|$|Toronto {{dispatched}} the Detroit Red Wings {{in seven}} {{games in the}} first round, then defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven games in the Division Finals. Hoping to meet long-time rival Montreal (who was playing in the Wales Conference finals against the New York Islanders) in the Cup finals, the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings in the Campbell Conference finals. They led the series 3–2, but dropped game six in Los Angeles. The game was not without controversy, as Wayne Gretzky clipped Gilmour {{in the face with}} his stick, but referee Kerry Fraser did not call a penalty, and Gretzky scored the winning goal <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> Leafs eventually lost in game seven 5–4.|$|E

25|$|While {{operating}} the crank {{a piece of}} shrapnel entered Anderson's back, paralyzing his legs but he continued to lower the boat and after looking {{around to see if}} anybody else needed help, the ensign slipped over the side into an oil slick. With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer in the water and attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E

Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah {{to complete his}} Jedi training, {{only to find the}} 900-year-old Yoda on his deathbed.

25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the curb, dead. <b>Moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E

25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers {{for the source of}} the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker stall alert, warning the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and tried to tell the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried to recover from the stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a nose up attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. <b>Moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match of}} the night {{featured}} CMLL's women's wrestling division as eight ladies competed for the La Copa 81 Aniversario ("81st Anniversary Cup") trophy in an elimination match. Dalys la Caribeña, {{one of the eight}} participants, came to the ring dressed like a winged Greek character, complete with a Greek soldier's helmet, leather strap outfit and both her face and body painted in black and red colors. She removed the attached wings and the metal helmet before the match. The teams were divided between the four tecnicas (Marcela, Estrellita, Princesa Sigehit and Goya Kong) facing off against the ruda team (La Amapola, Tiffany, Dalys and Zeuxis). After several minutes of wrestling, with all participants taking turns in the ring Tiffany was the first wrestler eliminated when Princesa Sugehit pinned her. <b>Moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> sides were evened out when La Amapola pinned the Mexican National Women's Champion Estrellita to eliminate her. From that point each elimination came quickly after each other, generally alternating between the two sides with Dalys, then Princesa Sugeith, then Goya Kong and finally La Amapola being eliminated leaving only Zeuxis and Marcela, the CMLL Women's World Champion. In the end Zeuxis completed the upset by defeating Marcel after also being instrumental in eliminating Princesa Sugeith and Goya Kong, winning the match. After the match Zeuxis posed with a trophy while celebrating her victory.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Shinyō Maru was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 {{with seven}} other vessels, {{including}} two torpedo boats, two tankers, {{and four other}} medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula {{on the island of}} Mindanao, when the USS Paddle found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the Shinyō Maru to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned Paddle to search for it. The Paddle, under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released {{in the direction of the}} Shinyō Maru, which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a few <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> Paddle was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the Shinyō Maru was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured Thompson submachine guns, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with their fists and improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.|$|E
