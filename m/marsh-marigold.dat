50|$|Caltha scaposa has {{flowers on}} stems that grow on after {{flowering}} from 7 to 24 cm high, {{with a thick}} rootstock that branches into many main roots. Its leaves are in a rosette and consist of a leafstalk and a leafblade. The leafstalk is up to 10 cm long, and has a narrow, membranous and about 2½ cm long sheath at the base. The leafblade is long hart-shaped or sometimes kidney-shaped (1½-3½ x 1-3 cm), with a blunt tip and an entire, scalloped or tooth-bearing margin. Mostly there are several flowering stems in each plant, which sometimes carry one, small, leaflike stipule and usually one, rarely 2 flowers of about 2½ cm across. As all <b>marsh-marigolds,</b> it lacks petals, but the five to nine (most often six) sepals are petal-like, strikingly yellow, inverted egg-shaped with a blunt tip, 10-15 x 6-8 mm. There are between twenty and forty stamens with flattened yellow filaments that carry yellow pollen, and encircle between ten and twenty carpels which are linear-oblong and prolonged into the persistent style, topped by an oblique and curved stigma. After pollination, the carpels develop into follicles of about 10x3 mm on 1½-3 mm long stalks. They may contain three to six ovoid, black seeds. Flowering occurs between June and August.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic {{plant species}} include large bittercress (Cardamine amara), <b>marsh-marigold</b> (Caltha palustris) and yellow iris.|$|E
50|$|In western Europe, the <b>marsh-marigold</b> moth Micropterix calthella bites {{open the}} anthers of the <b>marsh-marigold</b> {{and other plants}} to eat the pollen. The {{caterpillars}} that are present in summer and autumn also feed on <b>marsh-marigold,</b> although these are sometimes found on mosses too. Another visitor of Caltha palustris in western Europe is the leaf beetle Prasocuris phellandrii, which is black with four orange stripes and around ½ cm and eats the sepals. Its larvae inhabit the hollow stems {{of members of the}} parsley family. In the USA (Illinois) two species of leaf beetle can be found on Caltha: Plateumaris nitida and Hydrothassa vittata. The maggots of some Phytomyza species (Agromyzidae) are miners in Caltha leaves.|$|E

5000|$|... == Description == The alpine <b>marsh-marigold</b> {{is a small}} hairless, {{perennial}} alpine herb, with short, stout rhizomes, {{and forms}} dense mats. Its leaves have petioles of about 5 cm long with a leafblade that is oblong or lanceolate rounded triangular, 8-40 mm long, emarginate, with 2 lanceolate triangular appendages of 4-20 mm long on the upper surface. The flowering stem is 1-2 cm long, but grows to 5-10 cm when seeds are ripe. The five to eight sepals are between 10-22 mm long, white, but often tinged pink or purple, particularly at the base and the veins. Fifteen to thirty stamens with white or often pinkish filaments and yellow pollen encircle six to eighteen free carpels. When ripe, these have developed into follicles which are spreading, have short beaks and contain few seeds. Flowering occurs between November and December, often directly from under the receding snow.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>marsh-marigold</b> {{grows in}} places with {{oxygen-rich}} water {{near the surface}} of the soil. It likes richer soils, but dislikes application of fertilizer and avoids high concentrations of phosphate and ammonium, and is also shy of brackish water. It is often associated with seepage that is rich in iron, because iron ions react with phosphate, thus making it unavailable for plants. The resulting insoluble mineral appears as [...] "rusty" [...] flocs on the water soil and {{the surface of the}} stems of marsh plants. Around the edge of lakes and rivers it grows between reeds, and it can be found in black alder coppices and other regularly flooded and always moist forests. When it is present it often visually dominates when it is in bloom. It also used to be common on wet meadows, but due to agricultural rationalization it is now limited to ditches.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>marsh-marigold</b> mostly {{has several}} {{flowering}} stems {{of up to}} 80 cm long, carrying - mostly several - seated leaflike stipules - or the lower ones may be on a short petiole -, and between four and six (but occasionally as few as one or as many as twenty five) flowers. The flowers are approximately 4 (2-5½) cm in diameter. There are four to nine (mostly five) petal-like, brightly colored - yolk yellow, white or magenta -, inverted egg-shaped sepals, each about 1¾ (1-2½) cm long and 1⅓ (¾-1¾) cm wide with a blunt or sometimes acute tip. Real petals and nectaries are lacking. Between fifty and hundred-twenty stamens with flattened yellow filaments and yellow tricolpate or sometimes pantoporate pollen encircle between five and twenty-five free, flattened, linear-oblong, yellow to green carpels, with a two-lobed, obliquely positioned stigma, and each with many seedbuds. This later on develops into a seated, funnel-shaped fruit (a so-called follicle) of ¾-2 cm long and ¼-½ cm wide, that opens with one suture {{at the side of}} the axis and contains seven to twenty ovoid, brown to black seeds of about 2½×1⅓ mm.|$|E
40|$|Nach Nutzungsaufgabe ehemals artenreicher Feuchtwiesen (Senecioni-Brometum racemosi) der Talauen entwickelten sich artenarme Hochstaudenfluren. Das {{qualitative}} Ausmaß der Veränderungen konnte am Beispiel des mittleren Ostetals durch den Vergleich genauer Vegetationskarten und Dauerquadrataufnahmen analysiert werden. Der drastische Artenzahlrückgang ist verbunden mit der Dominanz weniger, hochwüchsiger Arten. Phalaridetum, Glycerietum, Filipendula- und Convolvuletalia-Gesellschaften sind auch noch nach 30 Jahren Brache Folgegesellschaften des Senecioni-Brometum. Aufgrund ihrer Konstitutionsmerkmale (Nährstoffakkumulation, Phytomasseproduktion und Fähigkeit, mit kräftigen Rhizomausläufern hohe Streuauflagen zu durchwachsen) sind Filipendula, Glyceria oder Phalaris in der Lage, in allen Ausbildungen der Sumpfdotterblumen-Wassergreiskrautwiesen schnell die Vorherrschaft zu gewinnen. Standorttypische Gehölze benachbarter Alno-Ulmion-Gesellschaften konnten sich infolge starker Beschattung noch nicht etablieren. Nach Wiederaufnahme der Nutzung ist bereits in den ersten 3 Jahren ein gravierender Ertragsrückgang festzustellen. In den nicht gedüngten Mädesüß-, Wasserschwaden- und Rohrglanzgras-Brachen wird bei zweimaliger Mahd bereits nach 3 Jahren eine erfolgsversprechende Restitution artenreicher Sumpfdotterblumenwiesen eingeleitet: viele Kennarten charakterisieren den rapiden Anstieg der Artenzahl. Die Reversibilität der Bracheentwicklung kann mit einer schnellen "biologischen Auslagerung" der naturnahen (nicht meliorierten) Brachestandorte erklärt werden. Species-rich meadows (Calthion communities) of the Oste {{valley in}} northwestern Germany (mowed twice a year) developed into stands of reeds and tall forbs (such as Filipendula ulmaria, Glyceria maxima, Phalaris arundinacea and Urtica dioica) with low species diversity when the management was abandoned. Changes in species composition and dominance, {{as well as}} a marked decline in the species diversity per plot are distinct. The change from <b>marsh-marigold</b> meadows (Senecioni-Brometum) to tall grass-reeds and/or tall forb communities proceeds rapidly: The expansion of some of the component species of the "initial floristic composition" occured in the first years after abandonment. Dominant populations of the taller species inhibit succession both shortly after abandonment and over the long run. The major constraint on succession is shade: from the dominant plant species themselves as well as from a dense litter layer. These stands become slowly enriched, because environmental inputs are stored in the living plant material. Over a period of 3 — 5 years, a re-establishment of a mowing routine results in a rapid reduction of aboveground biomass, combined with a rapid increase in species richness. Decreases in available resources due to interruption of internal translocation inhibit the growth of the formerly dominant plant species. As result species of the Senecioni-Brometum meadows are able to become established. The ability to grow with fewer resources and the removal of the aboveground biomass (2 x/year, fulfilling a demand for light) favor coexistence. The regeneration experiment has already been quite successful. Management costs may be reduced for some years by restricting the mowing frequency, without an ultimate loss in species diversity...|$|E
