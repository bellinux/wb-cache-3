The Monge property holds for the costs. Other simple properties of the function are also presented. A pair of dynamic programs for maximizing the function is proposed.

We present a planning approach, which rapidly expands a search tree, inspired by an RRT planner by choosing promising nodes to expand and expanding them randomly. Genetic algorithms are used to learn sets of configuration parameters for the planner, i. e., how to expand which nodes.

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we have performed nearly half a million numerical experiments to examine the long term ramifications of planetary scattering on planetary systems. We have concluded that systems which form in dense environments such as Orion's Trapezium cluster have roughly a ten percent chance of being seriously disrupted. We have also used our programs to explore the long-term prospects for our own Solar system. Given the current interstellar environment, we have computed the odds that Earth will find its orbit seriously disrupted prior to the emergence of a runaway greenhouse effect driven by the Sun's increasing luminosity. This estimate includes both direct disruption events and scattering processes that seriously alter the orbits of the Jovian planets, which then force severe changes upon the Earth's orbit. We then explore the consequences of the Earth being thrown into deep space. The surface biosphere would rapidly shut down under conditions of zero insolation, but the Earth's radioactive heat is capable of maintaining life deep underground, and perhaps in hydrothermal vent communities, for some time to come.

In addition to natural sources, environments are exposed to anthropogenic inputs of all these gases from oil and gas extraction and distribution. The gases provide carbon and/or energy for a diverse range of microorganisms that can metabolize them in both anoxic 3 and oxic zones. Aerobic methanotrophs, which can assimilate methane, have been considered to be entirely distinct from utilizers of short-chain alkanes, and studies of environments exposed to mixtures of methane and multi-carbon alkanes have assumed that disparate groups of microorganisms {{are responsible for the}} metabolism of these gases. Here we describe the mechanism by which a single bacterial strain, Methylocella silvestris, can use methane or propane as a carbon and energy source, documenting a methanotroph that can utilize a short-chain alkane as an alternative to methane. Furthermore, during growth on a mixture of these gases, efficient consumption of both gases occurred at the same time. Two soluble di-iron centre monooxygenase (SDIMO) gene clusters were identified and were found to be differentially expressed during bacterial growth on these gases, although both were required for efficient propane utilization.

Also, the focus is generally on the prediction of saturation areas regardless of whether they are connected to the catchment hydrographic network or rather present in isolated topographic depressions.

The focus was on the 30 [*]km 2 Girnock catchment (Cairngorm Mountains, northeast Scotland) and its 3 [*]km 2 sub-catchment, Bruntland Burn in which seven field surveys were done to capture actual maps of connected saturated areas in both dry and humid conditions.

Geomorphic indices including information on terrain shape, steepness, aspect, soil texture and soil depth showed potential but generally performed poorly.

The availability of silver-resistance conferring DNA sequences now allow genetic and mechanistic studies that had basically been missing. The genes determining Ag(I) resistance were sequenced from a plasmid found in a burn ward isolate. The 14. 2 kb determinant contains seven recognized genes, arranged in three mRNA transcriptional units. The silE gene determines an extracellular (periplasmic space) metal-binding protein of 123 amino acids, including ten histidine residues implicated in Ag(I) binding. SilE is homologous to PcoE, of copper resistance. The next two genes, silR and silS, determine a two protein, histidine-kinase membrane sensor and aspartyl phosphate transcriptional responder, similar to other two component systems such as CzcR and CzcS (for cadmium, zinc and cobalt resistance) and PcoR and PcoS (for copper resistance). The remaining four genes, silCBAP, are co-transcribed and appear to determine Ag+ efflux, with SilCBA homologous to CzcCBA, a three component cation/proton antiporter, and SilP a novel P-type ATPase with a amino-terminal histidine-rich cation-specificity region. The effects of increasing Ag+ concentrations and growth medium halides (Cl-, Br- and I-) have been characterized, with lower Cl- concentrations facilitating resistance and higher concentrations toxicity. The properties of this unique Ag(I) -binding SilE protein are being characterized. Sequences similar to the silver-resistance DNA are being characterized by Southern blot DNA/DNA hybridization, PCR in vitro DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing.

Yet, geochemical models still fail to produce accurate predictions of the various modes of serpentinization, which limits our ability to predict a variety of related geological phenomena over many spatial and temporal scales. Here, we utilize kinetic and reactive transport experiments to parameterize the brucite silicification reaction and provide fundamental constraints on SiO 2 transport during serpentinization. We show that, at temperatures characteristic of the sub-seafloor at the serpentinite-hosted Lost City Hydrothermal Field (150 °C), the assembly of Si tetrahedra onto MgOH 2 (i. e., brucite) surfaces is a rate-limiting elementary reaction in the production of serpentine and/or talc from olivine. Moreover, this reaction is exponentially dependent on the activity of aqueous silica [see manuscript], such that it can be calculated according to the rate law: [see manuscript]. Calculations performed with this rate law demonstrate that both brucite and Si are surprisingly persistent in serpentinizing environments, leading to elevated Si concentrations in fluids that can be transported over comparatively large distances without equilibrating with brucite. Moreover, applying this rate law to an open-system reactive transport experiment indicates that advection, preferential flow pathways, and reactive surface area armoring can diminish the net rate of Si uptake resulting from this reaction even further. Because brucite silicification is {{a fundamental}}ly rate-limiting elementary reaction for the production of both serpentine and talc from forsterite, our new constraints are applicable across the <b>many</b> <b>environments</b> <b>where</b> serpentinization occurs. The unexpected but highly consequential behavior of this simple reaction emphasizes the need for considering serpentinization and many other hydrothermal processes in a reactive transport framework whereby fluid, solute, and heat transport are intimately coupled to kinetically-controlled reactions...|$|E

To understand genetic patterns of adaptive variation, natural populations of these species were sampled along an altitudinal gradient and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. Population structure was estimated using Bayesian clustering analyses and a multivariate method, revealing the presence of 3 genetic clusters for A. alba and L. decidua, and 4 for P. abies, P. cembra and P. mugo. Inferred genetic structure was tested for correlation with latitude, longitude and the altitudinal gradient using multivariate analysis. Genetic variation resulted significantly correlated with geographic location in all five species: latitude was highly significant for A. alba and longitude for the other species.

40|$|Soil {{variability}} {{is often}} seen as problematic in land degradation studies in terms of sampling effort, data interpretation and for the extrapolation of results to other areas or time periods. Examples are given from land degradation research undertaken in central Spain which demonstrate {{some of these problems}} associated with soil variability. Geostatistics is presented as a useful tool for quantifying soil variability and in particular the variogram for interpreting and understanding spatial patterns. Soil variability is also seen to complicate the issues surrounding management strategies and makes monospecific management strategies less likely to be successful. In recent years several studies have suggested that variability in soil properties and vegetation cover may reduce the risk of land degradation by minimizing the spatial extent of runoff and erosion. These studies suggest that increasing soil variability may prove to be an effective strategy for reducing the runoff and erosion risk. This paper discusses these ideas and highlights the importance of increasing thresholds above which runoff and erosion occurs for the success of such strategies. This in particular applies to <b>many</b> semiarid <b>environments</b> <b>where</b> thresholds are deemed to be extremely low.
