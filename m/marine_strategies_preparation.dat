This leads one to think that marine spatial planning in various countries in the EU will be directed at complying with the Directive's environmental goals, {{as is the case in}} Spain, rather than undertaking proactive planning for developing the maritime sectors. To put the case of Spain into perspective, a review is conducted of the initiatives taken, especially in Europe and the European Union, exploring the correlations between the main focuses of the maritime sectors and the planning systems. The analysis of the Spanish initiative demonstrates how the maritime economy model and geopolitical factors explain the planning options for the marine environment.

40|$|The EU <b>Marine</b> <b>Strategy</b> Directive (MSD) has a {{regional}} focus in its implementation. The directive obliges countries to take multiple uses and the <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> of neighboring countries {{into account when}} formulating <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> and when designating marine protected areas (MPAs). We use game theoretical analysis both to find the optimal size of MPAs with multiple uses by multiple countries and to investigate the influences of multiple uses on cooperation. To this end, we develop a model in which two specific uses, fisheries and nature conservation, by multiple countries are considered in a strategic framework. The results of the paper suggest that EU marine policy such as the MSD and the coming Maritime Policy may help to secure the highest possible benefits from these MPAs if these policies induce cooperation among countries, but only if policies force countries to consider all possible benefits of MPAs. In fact cooperation on a single issue may give a worse outcome than the noncooperative equilibrium. The results also indicate that cooperation {{may be hard to}} achieve because of defector incentives, and therefore policy measures should be strict in enforcing cooperation on all possible uses of MPAs...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, the European Commission adopted {{its first}} {{legislative}} instrument for comprehensive {{protection of the}} marine environment, the <b>Marine</b> <b>Strategy</b> Framework  Directive (MSFD). By the end of 2012, the first concrete steps have been taken {{in the implementation of}} the directive, including its transposition into national legislations and the preparation of {{the first phase of the}} national <b>marine</b> <b>strategies,</b> i. e. Initial Assessment (IA) (Art. 8), Determination of Good Environmental Status (GES) (Art. 9), and Setting Environmental Targets and Indicators (Art. 10). These steps aim at national <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> that will further include a Monitoring Programme and a Programme of Measures. The aim of this report is to describe and compare the different preparation processes the MSFD enacted in Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Finland. Throughout the Baltic Sea region, the preparation process has been supported by informal EU level working groups as well as by HELCOM working groups and projects. While the former WGs have concentrated on creating common understanding and providing guidelines for the process, the contribution of the latter ones has been mainly on providing relevant information (i. e. assessments and indicators) for the Baltic Sea region. This study was conducted between June and October 2012 and therefore the observations presented in this report reflect to the processes that took place up to October 2012.   The MSFD had been transposed into national legislation in all of the case countries apart from Poland in which the transposition is expected to be finalised by the end of 2012. The delay in the transposition process has significant consequences to the preparation process of Polish national <b>marine</b> <b>strategy.</b> However, all of the four countries failed to finalise the first phase of the national <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> (i. e. articles 8, 9 and 10 of the directive) by July 15 th 2012, as was required by the directive. Furthermore, the directive stipulated that the first phases of the national <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> are reported to the Commission by October 15 th 2012, but Denmark was the only country able to report the complete first phase of its national <b>marine</b> <b>strategy</b> to the Commission by the established deadline.   The preparation processes and the modes of operation varied regarding, for example, the division of responsibilities in the preparation process. In Denmark and Sweden the responsibility for implementing the MSFD was given to a single agency, whereas in Poland and Finland the responsibility was shared between three ministries and their respective administrative sectors. In Denmark and Poland, the preparation of articles 8, 9 and 10 were outsourced through tendering to national research institutes, universities and a consultancy company (in Denmark), whereas in Finland and Sweden, the related authorities (government agencies and institutes) have carried out the preparatory work as a part of their official duties.   In all of the four countries, relevant administrative sectors participated in the preparation process, however, wider stakeholder participation was organised only through the hearing procedures. The hearing procedure was organised in Finland and Sweden in the spring of 2012 and in Denmark over the summer of 2012. The procedure will be organised in Poland after the transposition of the MSFD has been finalised. Despite of the short – only 4 weeks long – hearing procedures over a hundred comments were received in Finland and over seventy in Sweden. In Denmark, the process lasted for 12 weeks and 28 comments were received. KnowSeas - Knowledge-based Sustainable Management of Europe's Sea...|$|R

This Directive is the key environmental instrument of the European Union (EU) maritime policy, and establishes that Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to achieve or maintain the Good Environmental Status (GES) of the marine environment by 2020. The central part of the MSFD is formed by the ‘marine strategies’, which have to be developed by the Member States for the marine waters under their jurisdiction. The implementation of the MSFD represents a demanding task in the integrative assessment of marine ecosystems. The first three steps of the implementation cycle of <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> (initial assessment, GES definition and establishment of environmental targets) concluded in 2012. The next task to be addressed in order to implement <b>marine</b> <b>strategies</b> is the elaboration of the monitoring programs (Article 11, MSFD).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} environmental justice in the regime for Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) currently developing in the European Union (EU). An 'ecosystem-based approach' to marine management is enshrined in the new Integrated Maritime Policy and <b>Marine</b> <b>Strategy</b> Framework Directive and forms the basis of MSP. This concept is intended to encompass all aspects of an ecosystem, including the human element. Yet the modes of including meaningful public participation {{in the decision-making process}} for MSP remain undetermined. At the same time, the Aarhus Convention (on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters) empowers non-governmental organisations to hold EU Member States to account. Consequently the issue of transparency will gain increased importance, as will linkages between human and environmental rights. Such public interest-based activism on the part of NGOs has the potential to enforce the developing framework for stakeholder engagement within MSP, but it also has implications worth considering regarding the appropriate role of interest-based organisations in the international political arena.

The {{first is}} how cur-rent knowledge on fish fauna and fishing activities {{are included in}} the <b>Marine</b> <b>Strategy</b> Directive (WFD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) adaptive planning. The MSD is relatively detailed in specifying such information but provides for considerable dis-cretion for member states as regards what to include in <b>marine</b> <b>strategies.</b> This has specific implications for coastal water as the WFD does not require fish species to be considered as a biological quality element in coastal waters. None of the directives requires member states to address fishing activities in the programmes of measures and this is in some situations not even possible. The sec-ond research question is how the MSD and WFD adaptive plan-ning impacts decisions according to the Common Fishery Policy regulation (CFP regulation), when deciding upon conservation measures. Despite a documented clear political ambition to inte-grate the MSD and WFD with the CFP regulation, integration has not effectively been realised in the legal instruments.
