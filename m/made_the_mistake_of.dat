5|$|Winter, who {{has never}} seen combat, resents the remark. He then takes {{exception}} to what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change {{the attitudes of the}} prisoners, his admiration for Irwin fading fast. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar (Clifton Collins, Jr.), who had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> saluting Irwin in the prison yard.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing to openly clash with the other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of}} the Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry, as {{he turned}} to leave <b>the</b> room, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> common <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> a man arguing with a woman--he {{attempted}} to have the last word.|$|R
60|$|His son succeeded him, {{and failed}} to profit by the {{paternal}} example: that is to say, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fatal <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> fighting for other people instead of fighting for himself.|$|R
50|$|Jawahar Singh <b>made</b> <b>the</b> big <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> leaving Pratap Singh {{the rebel}} of Jaipur, for the defence of Bharatpur. He {{considered}} Partap Singh to be a reliable man, {{but in this}} he was deceived.|$|R
5|$|In early April, Dangić <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{travelling}} to Serbia, {{where he}} met one of Nedić's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders, and attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly afterwards, Kuntze ordered Dangić's arrest. Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943. The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising, an anti-German rebellion {{which resulted in the}} deaths of 18,000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200,000 Polish civilians.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but {{did manage to}} rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And {{on top of all}} that a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} I was! I <b>made</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{my life when}} I ran away, so there! and I don't care who knows it!" [...] And Fred threw himself {{on a bench in}} front of the tent.|$|R
50|$|The story flashes back to how Dick and Nicole met. A {{distinguished}} psychiatrist, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> classic <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{falling in}} love with a patient, Nicole Warren, and marries her over the warnings from his mentor, Dr. Dohmler, that it will ruin Dick's career.|$|R
5|$|She was {{defeated}} {{the minute she}} tried to do it, because she could not sell the people of California {{that she would be}} a better fighter against communism than Dick Nixon. She <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fatal <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness.|$|R
5|$|That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved {{south to}} their objectives, {{reaching}} them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station. The commander <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being {{directed against the}} bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> threatening a mobilization of the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E
50|$|The British {{resumed their}} attack on June 5, but <b>made</b> <b>the</b> {{tactical}} <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> coming in separate columns, {{making it easier}} for the defenders to defeat them separately. At noon on the 7th, the British capitulated and retreated. Álzaga forced general Whitelocke to sign a document that included the surrender of Montevideo.|$|R
50|$|McFadden {{was such}} a good fighter that if he had been of another era he might well have been champion. But he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> crucial <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> being born during the age of three of the most phenomenal lightweights ever to lace on a glove: Joe Gans, Frank Erne, and Kid Lavigne.|$|R

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by Colonel (and former Minister of War) Adolphe Messimy, Micheler communicated his worries to Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot. On 6 April, Nivelle {{met with}} Micheler, Pétain and several politicians, {{including}} President Poincaré and Minister of War Painlevé at Compiegne. The investigation <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> questioning Nivelle's subordinates {{in front of}} him.|$|E
25|$|However, they <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> admitting the {{deception}} to some friends. This {{resulted in a}} scandal, and on February 17, 1525, Estrada and Albornoz were readmitted to the government, which now included all five men mentioned by Cortés. In order of importance, these were Salazar (factor), Almíndez (inspector), Estrada (treasurer), Albornoz (auditor) and Zuazo (justicia mayor).|$|E
5000|$|... "Mistakes were made" [...] is an {{expression}} that is commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying <b>the</b> person who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> <b>The</b> acknowledgement <b>of</b> [...] "mistakes" [...] is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> A less evasive construction might be {{along the lines of}} [...] "I made mistakes" [...] or [...] "John Doe <b>made</b> mistakes." [...] <b>The</b> speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word [...] "mistakes" [...] also does not imply intent.|$|R
50|$|Dualists either, like Descartes, {{avoid the}} problem by {{considering}} it impossible for a non-physical mind to conceive the relationship that it has with the physical, and so impossible to explain philosophically, or assert that <b>the</b> questioner has <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fundamental <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> thinking that <b>the</b> distinction between the physical and the non-physical is such that it prevents each from affecting the other.|$|R
5000|$|In the typed manuscript, Blunt {{conceded that}} spying for the Soviet Union was <b>the</b> biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> his life."What I did not realise is that I was so naïve {{politically}} that I was not justified in committing myself to any political action of this kind. The atmosphere in Cambridge was so intense, the enthusiasm for any anti-fascist activity was so great, that I <b>made</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> my life." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1960, Rank's Managing Director John Davis gave {{permission}} for More to work outside his contract {{to appear in}} The Guns of Navarone (1961). More, however, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> heckling and swearing at Davis at a BAFTA dinner at the Dorchester, losing both the role (which went to David Niven) and his contract with Rank.|$|E
25|$|During the 1977 Libyan–Egyptian War, {{there were}} some skirmishes between Libyan and Egyptian fighters. In one instance, two Libyan Air Force MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MFs that had been {{upgraded}} to carry Western weaponry. The Libyan pilots <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> trying to manoeuvre with the more nimble Egyptian fighters, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by EAF Maj. Sal Mohammad, while the other Libyan aircraft used its speed advantage to escape.|$|E
25|$|Boulton and Watt {{successfully}} challenged two of Murray's patents. Murray's patent of 1801, {{for improved}} air pumps and other innovations, and of 1802, for a self-contained compact engine {{with a new}} type of slide valve, were contested and overturned. In both cases, Murray had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> including too many improvements together in the same patent. This meant that if any one improvement were found to have infringed a copyright, the whole patent would be invalidated.|$|E
50|$|A {{thousand}} years later Felix Maian has just probably <b>made</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> his {{life when he}} releases the sealed sorceress that his ancestors had {{tried so hard to}} imprison. Now he is charged with the task of trying to keep the sorceress from once again trying to take over the world. Her powers limited because of a personal seal, to remove, Felix must kiss Felicia.|$|R
50|$|Ereka <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fatal <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{letting her}} friend, Katrina, {{go back up}} to the suite and fight in the {{boardroom}} against Nick, incorrectly believing that Bill would support her in this decision. While George wanted to dismiss Ereka, Carolyn preferred to fire Nick.Ereka also lost her temper during the argument against Bill and Nick, which did not help her case against getting fired.|$|R
50|$|James III's biographer sums Boyd {{up as an}} unscrupulous {{political}} gambler and an inveterate optimist. To forcibly assume guardianship of an underage King was, indeed, {{a familiar}} path to power in medieval Scotland, {{but it was also}} a dangerous path. Boyd underestimated the dangers, overestimated his support, and <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fatal <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> marrying his son to the King's sister, an insult the King would not forgive.|$|R
25|$|When Salazar and Almíndez {{arrived back}} in the capital, they {{suppressed}} {{the first of these}} decrees, and made known only the second one, thus taking over the government. However, they <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> admitting the deception to some friends. This resulted in a scandal, and on February 17, 1525, Estrada and Albornoz were readmitted to the government, which now included all five men mentioned by Cortés. In order of importance, these were Salazar (factor), Almíndez (inspector), Estrada (treasurer), Albornoz (auditor) and Zuazo (justicia mayor).|$|E
25|$|The {{followers}} of Valentinius attempted to systematically decode the Epistles, claiming that most Christians <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> reading the Epistles literally rather than allegorically. Valentinians understood {{the conflict between}} Jews and Gentiles in Romans to be a coded reference to the differences between Psychics (people who are partly spiritual but have not yet achieved separation from carnality) and Pneumatics (totally spiritual people). The Valentinians argued that such codes were intrinsic in gnosticism, secrecy being important to ensuring proper progression to true inner understanding.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to gain a}} {{foothold}} at Spitsbergen, the Basques ventured offshore. Even here they met with trouble. In July 1637, the Fleur, of Ciboure, under Dominique Daguerre, who had been whaling between 73° and 76° N, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> straying {{as far north as}} 78° N, where he encountered the Danish man-of-war De To Løver ("The Two Lions"), under Corfits Ulfeldt. Ulfeldt, who had been sent to Spitsbergen to protect Danish interests, led Daguerre to Kobbefjorden, where he seized 400 barrels of blubber and 100 quintals of baleen.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993 Kerry Fraser <b>made</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{his career}} when {{he failed to}} give Wayne Gretzky a five minute major for a blatant high stick on the Maple Leafs' Doug Gilmour in Game Six of the Western Conference Final. With Gilmour off the ice getting {{stitches}} for the resulting wound, Gretzky scored the game winning goal and the Kings won game 7.|$|R
5000|$|Trachycarpus takil {{was first}} {{discovered}} by a Major Madden, a British Army colonel {{with a passion}} for botany stationed in the Himalayas during the 1840s. Unfortunately, while Madden produced precise descriptions of both the plant and location, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fatal <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> assuming it to be Trachycarpus martianus, failing to realize it was a separate species, thus losing the chance to claim its discovery.|$|R
60|$|Yet Naomi had {{not always}} been an outcast. Her girlhood had been innocent; {{but she was the}} {{possessor}} of a dangerous beauty, and her mother was dead.
