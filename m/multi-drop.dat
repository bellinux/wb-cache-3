Other techniques have included superposition of signal on power conductors, and distances in excess of 80 km were achieved in subsea applications using these techniques.

50|$|ISO 11898-2 {{describes}} the electrical implementation formed from a <b>multi-dropped</b> single-ended balanced line configuration with resistor termination {{at each end}} of the bus.In this configuration a dominant state is asserted by one or more transmitters switching the CAN− to supply 0 V and (simultaneously) switching CAN+ to the +5 V bus voltage thereby forming a current path through the resistors that terminate the bus. As such the terminating resistors form an essential component of the signalling system and are included not just to limit wave reflection at high frequency.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} cabling {{required}} {{is much lower}} in Fieldbus than in 4-20 mA installations. This is because many devices share {{the same set of}} cables in a <b>multi-dropped</b> fashion rather than requiring a dedicated set of cables per device {{as in the case of}} 4-20 mA devices. Moreover, several parameters can be communicated per device in a Fieldbus network whereas only one parameter can be transmitted on a 4-20 mA connection. Fieldbus also provides a good foundation for the creation of a predictive and proactive maintenance strategy. The diagnostics available from fieldbus devices can be used to address issues with devices before they become critical problems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} cost {{advantages}} of a VMI (vendor-managed inventory) programme for different adoption rate levels in a given supply chain (SC). Further, it investigates classes of items that {{should be included in}} a VMI programme. A real SC has been considered in the study involving one manufacturer that distributes 80 items to 36 distribution centres (DCs) across Europe. Moreover, an ARENA 12. 0 simulation modelling package has been used to simulate the SC model over a one-year period. The results of the study show that the cost advantage of a VMI programme, while evident for DCs, even those characterized by lower adoption rates, is not so for the manufacturer. For the manufacturer, the cost leverage of adopting VMI depends on the geographical vicinity of its DCs, the inclusion of items with low sales volumes, and the adoption rate levels. The shorter the distance between the DCs served in the VMI solution, the greater the reduction of the transportation cost for the manufacturer; otherwise, the manufacturer cannot utilize <b>multi-dropping.</b> The reduction in lost sales for the manufacturer significantly depends on the items included in VMI; those items with high order batching bring a greater cost advantage if included in VMI. Finally, the inventory reduction for the manufacturer can be significant only with higher adoption rates or critical mass...|$|R

50|$|A DMX512 network {{employs a}} <b>multi-drop</b> bus {{topology}} with nodes strung together {{in what is}} commonly called a daisy chain.

50|$|<b>Multi-drop</b> {{is part of}} {{the initial}} Bisync protocol. A master station, {{normally}} a computer, can sequentially poll terminals which are attached via analog bridges to the same communication line. This is accomplished by sending a message consisting only of an ENQ character addressed to each device in turn.

50|$|Block-oriented {{terminals}} {{have the}} advantage of causing less system load on the host and less network traffic than character-oriented terminals. On a <b>multi-drop</b> line there is considerable overhead for each transmission which is the same for a single character as for thousands of characters. Block-oriented terminals may also appear more responsive to the user, especially over slow connections, since editing within a field is done locally on the terminal itself rather than depending on echoing from the host system.|$|E

50|$|RS-485, {{also known}} as TIA-485(-A), EIA-485, is a {{standard}} defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial communications systems. Electrical signaling is balanced, and multipoint systems are supported. The standard is jointly published by the Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries Alliance (TIA/EIA). Digital communications networks implementing the standard can be used effectively over long distances and in electrically noisy environments. Multiple receivers may be connected to such a network in a linear, <b>multi-drop</b> configuration. These characteristics make such networks useful in industrial environments and similar applications.|$|E
50|$|The widest {{application}} of D-subs is for RS-232 serial communications, though the standard {{did not make}} this connector mandatory. RS-232 devices originally used the DB25, but for many applications the less common signals were omitted, allowing a DE-9 to be used. The standard specifies a male connector for terminal equipment and a female connector for modems, but many variations exist. IBM PC-compatible computers tend to have male connectors at the device and female connectors at the modems. Early Apple Macintosh models used DE-9 connectors for RS-422 <b>multi-drop</b> serial interfaces (which can operate as RS-232). Later Macintosh models use 8-pin miniature DIN connectors instead.|$|E
50|$|The TiF {{aimed to}} tackle {{congestion}} at the times, places, and {{direction in which}} it is most expensive to the economy of Greater Manchester. A key part of the scheme was therefore to introduce a congestion charge. A capped day pass of £5 (at 2007 prices, estimated by AGMA to be £6 by 2013) was proposed for all vehicles, such as <b>multi-drop</b> delivery vehicles which may repeatedly cross charging rings during peak times. HGV and other commercial vehicles would be charged {{at the same rate as}} private cars up to the £5 cap. If charging had been introduced, it was claimed by 2013 the average weekday daily charge of £3 at 2007 prices would be no more than £3.60.|$|E

50|$|Asymptotic {{throughput}} {{is usually}} estimated by sending or simulating {{a very large}} message (sequence of data packets) through the network, using a greedy source and no flow control mechanism (i.e. UDP rather than TCP), and measuring the network path throughput in the destination node. Traffic load between other sources may reduce this maximum network path throughput. Alternatively, {{a large number of}} sources and sinks may be modeled, with or without flow control, and the aggregate maximum network throughput measured (the sum of traffic reaching its destinations). In a network simulation model with infinite packet queues, the asymptotic throughput occurs when the latency (the packet queuing time) goes to infinity, while if the packet queues are limited, or the network is a <b>multi-drop</b> network with many sources, and collisions may occur, the packet-dropping rate approaches 100%.|$|E

Both wired HART and WirelessHART devices may be represented in this block. In addition, the specification describes the expected method for HART configuration tools and asset-managing hosts to access HART devices using the native HART command protocol transported through the Foundation High Speed Ethernet (HSE) network.

50|$|SLIMbus is {{implemented}} as a synchronous 2-wire, configurable Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) frame structure. It has supporting bus arbitration mechanisms and message structures which permit re-configuring the bus operational characteristics to system application needs at runtime. Physically, the data line (DATA) and the clock line (CLK) interconnect multiple SLIMbus components in a <b>multi-drop</b> bus topology. SLIMbus devices may dynamically “drop off” {{the bus and}} “reconnect” to the bus as required by using appropriate protocols outlined in the SLIMbus specification.When used in a mobile terminal or portable product, SLIMbus may replace legacy digital audio interfaces such as PCM, I2S, and SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface for digital audio), {{as well as some}} instances of many digital control buses such as I2C, SPI, microWire, UART, or GPIO pins on the digital audio components.|$|E
50|$|CANaerospace {{sets forth}} {{a concept of}} {{managing}} the available bandwidth of a <b>multi-drop</b> CAN network to ensure predictable behavior for ATM and PTP communication which is called Time Triggered Bus Scheduling. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling {{is based on a}} limitation of the number of CAN messages that any node in the network may transmit within a minor time frame. The minor time frame is defined during initial system design. The maximum number of messages transmitted within one minor time frame may differ from node to node and contain growth potential if granted by system design. It is crucial to the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept that every node in the network adheres to its transmission schedule at all times when generating network traffic. It is neither required nor prohibited, however, that nodes in the network synchronize to other nodes concerning their message transmission order or transmission times.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of <b>multi-drop</b> path-based multidestination message passing on switch-based irregular networks. First, the <b>multi-drop</b> mechanism is defined with an associated header encoding scheme, and this mechanism {{is used to}} develop path-based multidestination worms. Next, a method is proposed to identify valid multidestination paths on arbitrary irregular networks with a typical deadlock-free routing. Then, the deadlock-free property of <b>multi-drop</b> path-based worms is emphasized. Using the above concepts, three multicast algorithms are proposed: <b>multi-drop</b> path-based greedy (MDPG), <b>multi-drop</b> path-based less-greedy (MDP-LG), and <b>multi-drop</b> pathbased binomial (MDP-B). The proposed algorithms are compared {{with each other and}} with the best unicast based algorithm, the CCO [5], for a range of system and technological parameters.
