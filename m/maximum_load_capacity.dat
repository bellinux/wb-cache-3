Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a systematic study on the effects of the cross-arm size (cross sectional diameter and thickness) and the cable stay cross sectional diameter on the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of single cross-arm prestressed stayed column system. As a result of the addition of cross-arms and prestressed cables, the traditional slenderness ratio definition for ordinary unstayed columns is not applicable for this type of structural system. Therefore, the effects of the cross sectional size of the additional cross-arm and stay on the <b>load</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> are studied for different lengths and cross sectional size of the main column. Nine different combinations of column length (short, intermediate and long) and column cross-section size (small, medium and large) are investigated. It is shown that the column cross section size has a negligible effect on the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> while the effect is much more significant with varying column length. An enhancement ratio, i. e. the ratio of <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of the stayed column to the critical buckling load of unstayed column is also presented. It is shown that optimum cross-arm and stay size leading to the maximum achievable enhancement ratio and <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> is independent {{of the size of the}} column. The enhancement ratio varies from about 14 with a corresponding 27. 9 % added volume (material) to about 40 with a corresponding 15 % added volume (material) with increasing column length...|$|R
