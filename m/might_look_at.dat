500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Playing what [...] "sounded good" [...] {{violated}} the established ethos of modes that the Greeks had {{developed by the}} time of Plato: a complex system of relating certain emotional and spiritual characteristics to certain modes (scales). The names for the various modes derived from the names of Greek tribes and peoples, the temperament and emotions of which were said to be characterized by the unique sound of each mode. Thus, Dorian modes were [...] "harsh", Phrygian modes [...] "sensual", and so forth. In his Republic, Plato talks about the proper use of various modes, the Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, etc. It is difficult for the modern listener to relate to that concept of ethos in music except by comparing our own perceptions that a minor scale is used for melancholy and a major scale for virtually everything else, from happy to heroic music. (Today, one <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the system of scales known as ragas in India for a better comparison, a system that prescribes certain scales for the morning, others for the evening, and so on.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For an originalist, {{however, the}} text is the {{beginning}} of the inquiry, and two originalists might reach very different results, not only from the strict constructionist, but from each other. [...] "Originalists can reach different results in the same case" [...] (see What originalism is not—originalism is not always an answer in and of itself, below); one originalist <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the context in which the clause was written, and might discover that the punishments listed in the clause were the only forms of capital punishment in use at that time, and the only forms of capital punishment that had ever been used at the time of ratification. An originalist might therefore conclude that capital punishment in general, including those methods for it invented since ratification, such as the electric chair, are not constitutional. Another originalist may look at the text and see that the writers created a list. He would assume that the authors intended this to be an exhaustive list of objectionable executions. Otherwise, they would have banned capital punishment as a whole, instead of listing specific means of punishment. He would rule that other forms of execution are constitutional.|$|E
