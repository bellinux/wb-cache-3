40|$|Results are {{described}} of a development test program directed at evaluating the structural {{capabilities of the}} <b>Marman</b> <b>V-band</b> <b>coupling</b> and flange with conoseal gasket. The intended end use was for the 75 K NERVA flight engine propellant lines. Of major importance in the structural evaluation was the ability to predict stresses throughout the assembly {{for a variety of}} loading conditions. Computer finite element analysis was used to predict these stresses but, for the subject configuration, large uncertainties were introduced in modeling the complex geometry and boundary conditions. The purpose of the structural tests was to obtain actual stresses and deflections for correlation with, and updating of the finite element model. Results of the incomplete test program are inconclusive with respect to determining suitability for use on the NERVA engine...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”To {{simulate}} the beam and wave interaction (BWI) {{of various types}} of traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), a digitized nonlinear theory has been developed with two features. First, the digitized RF field profiles obtained from electromagnetic simulation software are applied to replace the analytical RF field profiles in TWTAs. Second, the relationship of energy conservation between the beam and RF fields is used to derive the RF field equations. Based on this nonlinear theory, one-dimensional (1 -D) code has been constructed to predict the performances of TWTAs. Comparisons between the simulations and the experimental results for three types of TWTAs, i. e., a K-band helix TWTA, a <b>V-band</b> <b>coupled</b> cavity (CC) TWTA and a W-band folded waveguide (FWG) TWTA, are discussed to prove this nonlinear theory. 1...|$|R
