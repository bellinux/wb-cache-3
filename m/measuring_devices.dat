5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 {{parts per}} million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical <b>measuring</b> <b>devices,</b> such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E

50|$|Any <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> or {{apparatus}} acts as {{an environment}} since, at some stage along the measuring chain, {{it has to be}} large enough to be read by humans. It must possess {{a very large number of}} hidden degrees of freedom. In effect, the interactions may be considered to be quantum measurements. As a result of an interaction, the wave functions of the system and the <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> become entangled with each other. Decoherence happens when different portions of the system's wavefunction become entangled in different ways with the <b>measuring</b> <b>device.</b> For two einselected elements of the entangled system's state to interfere, both the original system and the measuring in both elements device must significantly overlap, in the scalar product sense. If the <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> has many degrees of freedom, it is very unlikely for this to happen.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} decimal <b>measuring</b> <b>devices,</b> developed in 1620 by the English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter, introduced two new units of measure— the chain and the link—and a new measuring device: Gunter's chain. Gunter's chain was one chain (one tenth of a furlong) in length and consisted of 100links, making each link 0.001 furlongs. The decimal nature of these units and of the device {{made it easy to}} calculate the area of a rectangle of land in acres and decimal fractions of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Indus valley developed a system of standardization, using weights and measures, evident by the excavations made at the Indus valley sites.

One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt.
