The resin and the catalyst are injected by a pump into a mixing head {{and then into the}} closed mould. When the resin is solidified, the die is opened and the piece is extracted [3, 4].

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Aluminum {{extrusion}} is a {{metal forming}} process {{used for the}} production of a large variety of solid, semi-solid and complex hollow products. During extrusion, the hot aluminum billet goes under severe plastic deformation as it is forced to flow through a smaller die cavity that defines the final shape of the extruding product. Surface finish and dimensional accuracy are the two most important criteria that specify the productivity and feasibility of the extrusion process which is highly influenced by the flow of aluminum through the deforming die. Therefore, die design is considered {{as one of the most}} important characteristics of the extrusion process that influences aluminum flow, quality of the extruding product and its dimensional accuracy. Currently, development of extrusion dies is primarily based upon the empirical knowledge of the die designer gained through trial and error, which inevitability is an expensive, time consuming and ineffective method. However, owing to the technological advancements of this century in the field of finite element modeling, this decade old trial and error method can now be replaced by numerical simulations that not only save time and money but also, can accurately predict the flow of aluminum through a die as well as predict die deformation occurring during the extrusion process The motivation of this research project came from a private extrusion die manufactures need for improving their pioneered <b>modular</b> <b>die</b> based on good analytical and scientific understanding of the dies performance during the extrusion process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} effect of die pressure on mechanical properties of a woodplastic composite (WPC) in an extrusion process. The strength-pressure relationship could govern the selection process of the equipment (size), especially for the load bearing applications of WPCs. A <b>modular</b> <b>die</b> was designed and manufactured to produce rod shaped products of various diameters. The induced pressure was also recorded. Tests on tensile and flexural strengths were carried out and bulk densities were measured. The results illustrate that an increase in die pressure significantly increases the strength of the product accompanied with a decrease in porosity and an increase in bulk density. When the pressure increased to 5 -folds, for smaller product size, the tensile and flexural strengths increased to 3 -folds and 2 -folds, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the project}} “Decision and design {{methodology}} for the lay-out of <b>modular</b> <b>dies</b> ” {{which is part}} of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries”, established and financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the main objective is setting guidelines for cost-effective and high quality high pressure die casting (HPDC) moulds. The strong increase in product variants and the growing demand for individualised products results in a growing complexity of all related products. The main objective of this project is bridging the existing gap between individual manufacturing and mass production. A new perspective on the value creation chain of HPDC-dies has to be established. First of all, the methodology for the lay-out of <b>modular</b> <b>dies</b> consists in an analysis of the already produced die cast moulds. For the development of modules, standard parts, and different die types, a wide range of HPDC-dies will be compared with each other and subsequently clustered along specific criteria such as size or number of core sliders. Another step consists in optimising setting-up time and maintenance. The as-is state in different companies will be examined. With this knowledge, new concepts will be developed, keeping a modular configuration of the different parts involved in mind. Concepts for modular core sliders, guides and ejectors will be developed and will be investigated for further use. Based on this information, the decision and design methodology for the lay-out of modular HPDC-dies will be examined and developed throughout the process...|$|R

40|$|The FluidForming {{technology}} {{represents an}} alternative {{sheet metal forming}} approach {{as compared to the}} traditional, bladder based hydroforming, metal spinning, and sheet metal stamping processes. The machine construction allows for much higher forming pressures of up to 400 [*]MPa/ 60, 000 psi. The technology also enables material flow into the dies, thus, providing more material in potentially critical areas. <b>Modular</b> <b>die</b> construction allows for very cost effective solutions including plastic dies, 3 D printed dies, die nesting, and split dies. This approach, in-turn, allows undercuts in the parts and generates scratch- and mostly distortion-free parts from pre-painted, pre-patterned, and pre-polished materials like AL, SS, CU, TI or any of the new high performance alloys. As a result, the technology enables a new product development approach that can focus on optimization and/or Time-to-Market while maintaining or lowering the overall Cost-to-Market. In fact, the development cycle can be accelerated to be less than a week from the CAD design to the production of highly accurate, repeatable metal parts that may not even be manufacturable with other technologies...|$|E
40|$|In {{aluminum}} extrusion {{the life}} of the die tooling components are mainly limited by wear and fatigue. Therefore reliable predictions of the amount of wear and its distribution in dies are important factors for the die manufacturer[1]. In this study the stress location and wear depth of the tooling components were calculated with the help of Archards wear model which is implemented into Deform 3 D finite element code for large scale plastic deformation. Using Deform 3 D a comparative study was conducted on the <b>modular</b> <b>die</b> design mandrel and die plate made out of powder metal (PM) tool steel without coating and Bilayer chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating of (TiCN + Al 2 O 3) to locate to maximum stress locations and to calculate the amount of wear that occurs during hot aluminum extrusion.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{clearance}} and sheet thickness in the AA 5754 sheet material blanking process on the burr formation and blanking force was examined experimentally. Measurements of the burr height and blanking force were {{performed in a}} <b>modular</b> <b>die</b> with six different clearance values (8 %, 10 %, 12 %, 14 %, 16 % and 18 %) by applying the blanking process to the AA 5754 sheet metal of 1 mm and 2 mm in thickness. The influence rate of parameters affecting the burr height, the blanking force, and the mathematical relationship between them were identified by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the regression analysis. Thus, {{it was determined that}} the burr formation increased with increased clearance and that the blanking force was not affected in the same proportion. In addition, {{it was found that the}} sheet thickness and clearance affected the burr formation at rates of 23. 24 % and 76. 15 %, respectively; on the other hand, the sheet thickness and clearance affected the blanking force at rates of 99. 72 % and 0. 24 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries" at the RWTH Aachen University, {{promoted}} and {{financed by}} the German Research Foundation (DFG) is pursuing the long-term goal of increasing the com-petitiveness of German production technology. Focus is {{on the development of}} cross-solutions for complicated tasks with an integrative approach. A major goal for production processes of the future is to create a synthesis of mass and individual production. The motivation behind this work lies in the reduction of production costs with a simultaneous increase of the current product range. For high pressure die casting in general, there is a one-to-one correlation between the die and casting. The time-consuming and costly design and manufacturing of die casting dies will be simplified, enabling rapid implementation of product variants. To achieve this, the methodology is composed of a sequence of three phases. During these phases, the focus is narrowed down from company perspective to die perspective, and finally, to die component perspective. By consecutively proceeding through the phases, one identifies the stage of the production process where modularisation is most beneficial, and categorises die components with respect to their modularisation potential. The final phase determines how a chosen component is turned into a module. This includes determining how many different variations of each module property are needed to be able to cover the desired product portfolio by simultaneously lowering the overall costs. The methodology provides a systematic approach for designing <b>modular</b> <b>dies</b> with which even individual customer requirements can be met...|$|R

Thus, the birefringence and the pressure drop of polystyrene were monitored inline during extrusion. Two experimental procedures were tested: steady-state and cessation of extruder feeding. The latter proved to be very useful {{in the case of}} polystyrene since the ratio between the birefringence and the pressure drop can be quantified {{for a wide range of}} steady-state conditions with a single experiment. In fact, down to relatively lower values of pressure drop, the birefringence proved to be a function of shear stress at the wall only, depending neither on the initial feeding rate nor on the aspect ratio of the slit die, for W/h down to 5, at least...|$|R

40|$|The most {{promising}} method {{capable of providing}} accurate measurements {{of the first and}} second normal-stress differences in shear flows at shear rates typical of polymer processing is the so-called hole-pressure method, but its use has not been as widespread as would be expected, namely due to the experimental difficulties associated with performing such experiments accurately. In this work, we use a small-scale <b>modular</b> slit <b>die</b> to assess the practical utility of the method for in-line monitoring of polymer melt flow. We provide a quantitative analysis of intrinsic error sources and use state-of-the-art data acquisition tools to minimize errors associated with pressure transducers.

For the experimental part of the work one <b>modular</b> profile extrusion <b>die</b> was built.

Extrusion experiments performed with this die evidence the capabilities of the flow balancing code and design strategies implemented to improve the performance of these tools. The numerical predictions are then compared with experimental data gathered during the extrusion experiments.

40|$|A novel on-line {{capillary}} rheometer (OLR) {{was used to}} examine the shear and extensional characteristics of polyolefin melts during twin screw extrusion (TSE). Comparisons with off-line rheometry were made using a twin-bore {{capillary rheometer}} and a <b>modular</b> in-line slit <b>die</b> rheometer (ILR) provided in-line rheometry comparisons. Both capillary rheometers were controlled via PCs running dedicated software, and the extrusion line and ELR were fully instrumented allowing real-time process monitoring to be carried out by IBM compatible PCs via data acquisition hardware and software. The prototype OLR was developed by the re-design of several key features including an instrumented transfer section and capillary die block which facilitated the use of various die geometries. Shear and extensional on-line rheometry of three polyethylenes (linear and branched), and four molecular weight grades of polypropylene were examined, and a direct comparison with off-line capillary rheometry showed a good correlation. The effect of a high loading of filler on two of the polyethylenes was investigated. In-line shear stress and entry pressure measurements showed a reasonable correlation with on-line rheometry. A study of entry flows in the OLR using capillary dies approaching orifice showed non-linearities occurred at very low capillary length to diameter(L:D) ratios, and this was repeatable using off-line rheometry. Predicted zero length entry pressures (Po) were used to estimate apparent extensional viscosity using a number of standard models. Melt instability and capillary wall slip were also investigated using on-line rheometry. Melt pressure and temperature in the twin screw extruder and OLR were monitored at various process conditions to examine the ability of the OLR to condition melt during testing, and the effect of OLR testing on extrusion conditions. Pressure variation in the extruder, OLR and off-line rheometer were compared in order to quantify process noise.
