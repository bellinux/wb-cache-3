5|$|Decrease in the {{population}} of the addax has begun notably since the mid-1800s. More recently, addax were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> overhunting, they have become much more restricted and rare.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|A {{result of}} its reef, the tourist {{industry}} is taking off in Msambweni attracting snorkelers. Holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up. Club Green Oasis caters <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> German tourists. Although supplied with electricity, in the 1990s the government expressed concerns about access to an ample clean water supply in the division.|$|E

30|$|The {{chipping}} of RFB with {{a mobile}} chipper “Chipping” {{is the process}} which most contributes to the following impact categories (Fig.  3): “Respiratory inorganics” (38  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides into the air; “Climate change” (35  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (fossil) into the air; “Ozone layer” (51  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of Halon- 1301 into the air; “Acidification/eutrophication” (34  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air; and “Fossil fuels” (52  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> the use of crude oil as raw material. This is also the process which most contributes to the “Resources” (53  %) and “Human Health (36  %) damage categories (Fig.  4).|$|R
30|$|The {{forwarding}} {{operation with}} a forwarder “Forwarding” {{is the second}} process that most contributes to “Respiratory inorganics” (24  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air, “Climate change” (23  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (fossil) into the air and “Acidification/eutrophication” (31  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air.|$|R
5|$|Although Battleship Division Nine's {{service was}} limited <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> convoy duty and the {{maintenance}} of the blockade of the German coast, its presence greatly augmented the strength of the Grand Fleet, thus making major combat between the British and German fleets even more unlikely in 1918. By helping to keep the High Seas Fleet effectively blockaded in port, Battleship Division Nine played a role in ensuring Allied control of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Although a few Dominican missionaries worked {{together}} to establish the University– including Miguel de Benavides, Bernardo Navarro, and other old professors from the higher {{colleges and universities in}} Spain– the founding of the University is attributed <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> Miguel de Benavides, the first to give a fund for the maintenance of the institution.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{plans have}} been made for a major urban {{extension}} in the town, <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would be built on 'Stanton Cross' site, with new schools, bus stops, community centres, shops, a doctor's surgery and new open spaces.|$|E
30|$|The {{processing}} {{of the trees}} with a harvester “Processing” presents a moderate contribution for the “Acidification/eutrophication” (20  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air, “Climate change” (15  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (fossil) into the air and “Respiratory inorganics” (16  %) <b>mainly</b> due <b>to</b> emissions of nitrogen oxide into the air.|$|R

5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, only 20 active College Republican {{chapters}} remained. By the US Presidential {{election in}} 1980, that number had increased to 1,000 active clubs, helping Reagan win 98 of 105 mock elections and recruiting thousands of voters. This success led to $290,000 in financial {{assistance from the}} RNC, <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> implement Jack Abramoff's field representative program. Abramoff's fund-raising efforts brought in an additional $1,160,000 {{during the next two}} years. By 1983, only 10% of the CRNC's budget came from the RNC.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{has deep}} roots in the Western Isles, but owing <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> the {{different}} allegiances of the clans in the past, {{the people in the}} northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly Presbyterian, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly Roman Catholic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the privatization of 1994, investment grew considerably due to the obligations imposed on the privatized companies.

5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{resided in}} Beaumont House {{until his death}} on 3 September 1906; his wife having predeceased him on 6 February 1902, {{and they had no}} children.

On 10 May 1943, Temporary Acting Lieutenant Commander Harold Thomas Stewart Clouston assumed command of Mallow. In December 1943, Mallow was not listed as active on the Navy List.|$|E
5|$|During Justinian's reign, the Balkans {{suffered}} from several incursions by the Turkic and Slavic peoples who lived {{north of the}} Danube. Here, Justinian resorted <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> a combination of diplomacy and a system of defensive works. In 559 a particularly dangerous invasion of Sklavinoi and Kutrigurs under their khan Zabergan threatened Constantinople, but they were repulsed by the aged general Belisarius.|$|E
5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> the interior.

He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library.

5|$|Egyptian gods were {{involved}} in human lives {{as well as in}} the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order.

5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
