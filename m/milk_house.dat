2500|$|In 1873, San Francisco {{physician}} Dr. John Cushing discovered 320 [...] "lost" [...] acres {{between the}} Reed and Richardson boundaries between present-day Corte Madera Avenue, across the creek, and into West Blithedale Canyon. Using the Homestead Act he petitioned {{the government and}} managed to acquire the land. [...] Before his death in 1879 he had built a sanitarium in the peaceful canyon. In Sausalito the North Pacific Coast Railroad had laid down tracks to a station near present-day Highway 101 at Strawberry. Seeing the financial advantages of a railroad his descendants then turned the hospital into the Blithedale Hotel after the land title was finally granted in 1884. The sanitarium was enlarged, cottages were built up along the property, and horse-drawn carriages were purchased to pick up guests at the Alto station. Within a few years, several other summer resort hotels had cropped up in the canyon including the Abbey, the Eastland, and the Redwood Lodge. Fishing, hunting, hiking, swimming, horseback riding, and other activities increased in popularity as people came to the area as vacationers or moved in and commuted to San Francisco for work. Meanwhile, Reed's mill deforested much of the surrounding redwoods, meaning {{that most of the}} redwoods growing today are second- or third-growth. The King family (King Street) owned property near the Cushing land. One of its buildings was a small adobe house which is believed to have predated the King farm. The Blithedale Hotel used it as a <b>milk</b> <b>house.</b> The adobe structure is still standing and connected to a house on West Blithedale Avenue; it is the oldest structure in Mill Valley.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} need {{has been}} felt for an efficient, odorless and relatively non-poisonous disinfectant {{that would be}} sufficiently cheap to warrant its routine use in <b>milk</b> <b>houses,</b> dairy barns, swine barns and other farm buildings. No disinfectant in com-mon use fulfills all of these requirements. Some substances are not efficient germicides under actual field conditions and {{in the presence of}} organic matter, while certain other disinfectants pos-sess a strong and characteristic odor which makes their use in <b>milk</b> <b>houses</b> and dairy barns impractical. Almost all of the efficient disinfectants are entirely too expensive to justify their routine use under farm conditions and the great majority of the disinfectants are known to be poisonous to livestock when used in their germicidal dilutions. Preliminary studies on sodium hydroxide indicated a satis-factory germicidal efficiency against non-sporulating micro-organisms. High-test commercial household lye was chosen as a satisfactory source of sodium hydroxide.
