50|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the second}} week after fertilization, {{transverse}} segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm begins, and it is converted into a series of well-defined, more or less cubical masses, also known as the somites, which occupy the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line from the occipital region <b>of</b> the <b>head.</b> Each segment contains a central cavity (known as a myocoel), which, however, is soon filled with angular and spindle-shape cells. The somites lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of the neural tube and notochord, and are connected to the lateral mesoderm by the intermediate cell mass. Those of the trunk may be arranged in the following groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5 to 8. Those of the occipital region <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> are usually described as being four in number. In <b>mammals,</b> somites <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> can be recognized only in the occipital region, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that they are present also in the anterior part <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> and that, altogether, nine segments are represented in the cephalic region.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} <b>of</b> {{the ideal}} <b>head</b> varies dramatically from breed to breed {{based on a}} mixture of the role the horse is bred for and what breeders, owners and enthusiasts find appealing. Breed standards frequently cite large eyes, a broad forehead and a dry head-to-neck connection as important to correctness about the head. Traditionally, the length <b>of</b> <b>head</b> as measured from poll to upper lip should be two-thirds {{the length of the}} neck topline (measured from poll to withers). Presumably, the construction <b>of</b> the horse's <b>head</b> influences its breathing, though there are few studies to support this. Historically, a width of 4 fingers or 7.2 cm was associated with an unrestricted airflow and greater endurance. However, a study in 2000 which compared the intermandibular width-to-size ratio of Thoroughbreds with their racing success showed this to be untrue. The relationship between head conformation and performance are not well understood, and an appealing head may be more a matter of marketability than performance.Among <b>mammals,</b> morphology <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> often plays a role in temperature regulation. Many ungulates have a specialized network of blood vessels called the carotid rete, which keeps the brain cool while the body temperature rises during exercise. Horses lack a carotid rete and instead use their sinuses to cool blood around the brain. These factors suggest that the conformation <b>of</b> a horse's <b>head</b> influences its ability to regulate temperature.|$|R
