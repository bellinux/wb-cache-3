40|$|The MAGRITTE telescopes {{are part}} of the SHARPP {{instrument}} suite, part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a NASA spacecraft to be launched in a geostationnary orbit in 2007. The MAGRITTE instrument package will provide high resolution images of the solar corona at high temporal frequency simultaneously in 5 EUV and in Ly-alpha narrow bandpasses. The 1. 4 R[SUB] 0 [/SUB] MAGRITTE common field of view complements the other SHARPP instruments, as well as its spectral coverage with 6 narrow bandpasses located within the 19. 5 to 120 nm interval. The key challenges of the MAGRITTE instrument are a high angular resolution (0. 66 arcsec/pixel) with a high responsivity (exposure times smaller than 8 sec), combined with restricted spacecraft resources. The design of MAGRITTE is based on a high performance off-axis Ritchey-Chretien optical system combined with a large detector (4 K x 4 K, 12 µm pixel). The tight pointing stability performance of 1. 2 arcsec over the image exposure time requires an active image motion control, using pointing information of a Guide Telescope, to compensate low frequency boresight variations produced by spacecraft jitter. The thermomechanical design and the <b>mirror</b> <b>polishing</b> are highly critical issues in the instrument design. This paper presents the MAGRITTE design concept with the expected performances based on a realistic error budget. The <b>mirror</b> <b>polishing</b> concept and performances are discussed...|$|R
