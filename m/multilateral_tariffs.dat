40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of trade {{barriers}} using highly disaggregated data. The level of disaggregation allows us to separate {{the effects of}} tariffs and nontariff barriers (NTBs) into reduction, diversion, and compression effects. We find that <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> significantly reduce trade flows and that trade preferences have a significant diverting effect. We also find that higher <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> tend to shift trade towards larger exporters, suggesting that the desire to minimize fixed costs associated with trading dominates any preference for variety. In the case of NTBs, we find that, as often as not, the imposition of an NTB leads {{to an increase in}} the value of trade; in industries with low import demand elasticities, the influence of rising prices outweighs the decline in quantity. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the GATT/WTO negotiating rules are capable of delivering a politically efficient equilibrium. Such an equilibrium is, however, economically inefficient. Global free trade, in particular, is unattainable even in a fully cooperative world, if governments have political motivations. In such a context, we show that regional trade agreements can help move the world towards a welfare-superior equilibrium. The reason is that, when members of regional trade agreements lower trade barriers against one another, they tend to reduce their <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> as well. Once we account for these endogenous changes—and only then—we find that regionalism can raise world welfare even in a fully cooperative (but political) world.

40|$|In many {{preferential}} trade agreements (PTAs), countries exchange not only reductions in trade barriers but also cooperation in non-trade {{issues such as}} labour and environmental standards, intellectual property, etc. We provide a model of PTAs motivated by cooperation in non-trade issues and analyse its implications for global free trade and welfare. We find that such PTAs increase the cost of <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions and thus cause a stumbling block to global free trade. This occurs because <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions decrease the threat {{that can be used}} in PTAs and thus the surplus that can be extracted from them. By explicitly modelling the interaction between preferential and multilateral negotiations, we derive a testable prediction and provide novel econometric evidence that supports the model's key prediction. The welfare analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing this type of PTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus the model can predict the rules we observe.

40|$|Increasingly, in {{regional}} agreements, large economies, e. g. U. S. and E.

This occurs because multilateral tariff reductions decrease the threat that large countries can use in preferential agreements causing a loss in their bargaining power. The result is due to current exceptions in the WTO to the most-favorite-nation rule which allow for lower than MFN tariffs, e. g. art. XXIV and GSP. By explicitly modeling the interaction between preferential and multilateral negotiations we analyze the effects on <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariffs</b> and welfare of strengthening the MFN rule and show that large and small countries may not prefer the same regime of rules.

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of the {{formation}} of regional free trade agreements on the ability of countries to maintain low cooperative <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariffs.</b> We assume that countries can not make binding international commitments, but are instead limited to self-enforcing arrangements. Specifically, we model cooperation in multilateral trade policy as involving a constant balance between, on the one hand, the gains from deviating unilaterally from an agreed-upon trade policy, and on the other, the discounted expected future benefits of maintaining multilateral cooperation, with the understanding that the latter would be forfeited in the trade war which followed a unilateral defection in pursuit of the former. In this context, we explore {{the way in which the}} formation of regional free trade agreements upsets the balance between current and future conditions, and trace through the dynamic ramifications of these effects for multilateral cooperation. Our results suggest that the emergence of regional free trade areas will be accompanied by a temporary retreat from liberal multilateral trade policies. Eventually, however, as the full impact of the emerging free trade agreement on multilateral trade patterns is felt, the initial balance between current and expected furture conditions tends to reemerge, and liberal multilateral trade policies can be restored. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to explain the}} heterogeneity observed in the adoption of antidumping laws by small developing countries {{in an environment of}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction. The analysis is based on a three-stage game of trade policy determination with imperfect competition in differentiated products where the poten-tial lobby for protection is reflected in the government’s objective function and where tariffs may be bound due to multilateral trade agreements. This framework implies that the implementation of this administrative protection device is the government’s best response when <b>multilateral</b> bound <b>tariffs</b> reach a sufficiently low threshold. The heterogeneity in the adoption decision is explained by the relative size of the domestic market, the degree of product differentiation and political economy motives.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} additional {{findings from}} the on-going work of the OECD project on trade preference erosion. The purpose was to assess in more detail the situation of those preference-reliant countries seen as being most at risk of experiencing negative welfare effects from preference erosion {{as a consequence of}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalisation (building on Lippoldt and Kowalski, 2005). Based on a selection criterion, 7 developing countries were chosen for inclusion in the present study: Bangladesh, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Using the standard GTAP database and model, the paper considers a scenario of <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalisation involving a 50 % linear reduction in the ad-valorem equivalent measure of protection. Whereas most developing regions experienced welfare gains as a consequence of such a scenario, the selected countries were found to be at risk of modest welfare losses, most of which were associated with tariff liberalisation by European Union countries (EU- 15). Where negative welfare impacts occurred in the selected developing countries, they tended to be driven primarily by terms of trade losses (especially by negative export price effects). In line with the modest size of the estimated welfare losses, the overall impact in terms of structural adjustment [...] as measured by an index of structural change [...] tended to be relatively modest. For three of the seven developing countries, welfare losses primarily associated with the EU- 15 tariff liberalisation are estimated to be more than fully offset by greater gains arising from improved market access in other sectors and markets. nonreciprocal preferences, preference erosion, CGE simulation, statistical review, developing countries, <b>multilateral</b> trade negotiations, <b>tariff</b> reductions...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a 3 country {{world in which}} each country's import market is served by competing exporters from its 2 trading partners. We assume that weak multilateral enforcement mechanisms prevent governments from implementing efficient trade policies through a <b>multilateral</b> agreement requiring <b>tariffs</b> {{to conform to the}} most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. We then ask whether ex- ceptions from MFN for the purpose of forming preferential agreements can lead to lower external tariffs, and thereby to a more efficient tariff structure under the multilateral agreement. We identify 3 opposing effects of prefer- ential agreements on the <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> structure in this setting. The tariff complementarity effect works to reduce the desired external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement. Two additional effects of preferential agreements arise only when enforcement issues at the multilateral level are considered. One of these, the punishment effect, weakens the ability of the member countries of a preferential agreement to punish deviations from the multilateral agreement thereby interfering with the ability of countries to sustain low <b>tariffs</b> under the <b>multilateral</b> agreement. The <b>tariff</b> discrimination effect lets countries to discriminate against those who would external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement. The relative strengths of these 3 effects determine the impact of a prefer- ential agreement on the tariff structure under the multilateral agreement.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{implications}} of customs union formation for <b>multilateral</b> <b>tariff</b> cooperation.

The {{early stages of the}} process of customs union formation are shown to alter this dynamic incentive constraint in a way that leads to a temporary "honeymoon" for liberal multilateral trade policies. We find, however, that the harmony between customs unions and multilateral liberalization is temporary: Eventually, as the full impact of the emerging customs union becomes felt, a less favorable balance between current and future conditions reemerges, and the liberal multilateral policies of the honeymoon phase cannot be sustained. We argue that this is compatible with the evolving implications of the formation of the European Community customs union for the ability to sustain liberal multilateral trade policies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. ...|$|R
