25|$|Chinese {{folklore}} {{features a}} rich variety of ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural creatures. According to traditional beliefs a ghost {{is the spirit}} form {{of a person who}} has died. Ghosts are typically malevolent and will cause harm to the living if provoked. Many Chinese folk beliefs about ghosts have been adopted into the mythologies and folklore of neighboring cultures, notably Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. Beliefs about ghosts are closely associated with Chinese ancestor worship, where <b>much</b> <b>have</b> been incorporated into Taoism. Later beliefs were influenced by Buddhism and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs about the supernatural.|$|E

This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how <b>much</b> <b>have</b> we spent so far, {{how much do we}} have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

500|$|Four years later, Samuelsson {{attracted}} {{media attention}} after being {{left off the}} Swedish roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics. He told reporters, [...] "I pretty <b>much</b> <b>have</b> one comment and maybe I'll regret it. But they [...] can go fuck themselves," [...] adding {{that he was not}} interested in being later added to the roster {{in the event of an}} injury. His omission was highly publicized by Swedish media as he was in the midst of a career season with the Canucks (he went on to record the second-highest goals total among Swedish NHLers that season in 2009–10, with 30). Sweden went on to lose to Slovakia in the quarterfinal, failing to medal.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} {{shots of}} beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects {{as well as}} real actors. In particular, during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead, over 3,000 live bugs were shot crawling {{on the body of}} Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because [...] "bugs don't take directions very well, so you pretty <b>much</b> <b>have</b> to wait until they decided to get it right." [...] Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and [...] "dummy bugs".|$|E
500|$|In Monteux's {{lifetime}} it {{was rare}} for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would <b>much</b> <b>have</b> preferred it, he said, [...] "if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, {{and some have}} been issued on compact disc. It {{has been argued that}} these reveal even more than his studio recordings [...] "a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line." ...|$|E

The third film was scheduled to be released on June 10, 2016, and the fourth was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018. Paul Giamatti confirmed that Rhino would return in the third film. That November, Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton told analysts, [...] "We do very <b>much</b> <b>have</b> the ambition about creating a bigger universe around Spider-Man.

In February 2014, Sony announced that Webb would return to direct the third Amazing Spider-Man film. In March 2014, Webb stated {{that he would not be}} directing the fourth film, but would like to remain as a consultant for the series. On July 11, 2014, Roberto Orci told IGN that he is not working on the third film due to the third Star Trek film. Alex Kurtzman revealed in an interview that the third film is still continuing production and there is a possibility of seeing a Black Cat film. On July 23, 2014, Sony Pictures announced that The Amazing Spider-Man 3 was delayed to 2018. After the announcement in February 2015 of a new franchise with Marvel Studios, the sequels to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 were cancelled.|$|E
