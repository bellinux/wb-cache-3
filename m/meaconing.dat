50|$|Finally, {{in support}} of the meacon theory, this {{information}} that surfaced during the ICAO investigation and is considered indicative of purposeful intent to cause KAL 007 to go astray: At 28 minutes after takeoff, civilian radar at Kenai, on the eastern shore of Cook Inlet and 53 nmi km southwest of Anchorage, with a radar coverage of 175 mi west of Anchorage, tracked KAL 007 more than six miles (10 km) north of its intended course. KAL 007 and all flights departing from Anchorage on route J501 had to pass Cairne Mountain, which was the site of a nondirectional radio beacon (NDB). An NDB navigational aid operates by transmitting a continuous three-letter identification code which is picked up by the airborne receiver, the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF). Cairne Mountain was KAL 007's first assigned navigational aid out of Anchorage Airport. That night, Douglas L. Porter was the controller at Air Route Traffic Control Center at Anchorage, assigned to monitor all flights in that sector and record their observed position in relation to the fix provided by the Cairne Mountain nondirectional beacon. Porter later testified that all had seemed normal to him. Yet he apparently failed to record, as required, the position of two flights that night: KAL 007 and KAL 015, which followed KAL 007 by several minutes. Had he done so, it would have provided an opportunity to warn KAL 007 of its deviation, resulting in the necessary correction {{for the rest of the}} flight.

These devices have revolutionized how we move: they guide us not only in unknown places but also within our own neigh-bourhoods. Our growing dependence on them to find our way is risky though: since the airwaves that carry GNSS sig-nals are broadcast in the open air with a relatively weak strength, they are vulner-able to spoofing and <b>meaconing</b> attacks.

The proliferation of portable jamming devices [3], the evolution of spoofing or <b>meaconing</b> techniques, and the collateral interference effects caused by a possible deployment of a 4 G Long Term Evolution network in the 1, 552.7 -MHz band [4] drive to the inclusion of countermeasures against RFI.|$|E
40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of GNSS to {{radio frequency interference}} and spooﬁng {{becomes more and more}} of concern for navigation applications which require a high level of accuracy and reliability, e. g. for safety of life applications in aviation, railway and maritime environments. Besides pure power jamming with CW, noise or chirp signals, intentional or unintentional spooﬁng with faked GNSS signals is considered as a potential threat. The simplest kind of spooﬁng, so- called <b>meaconing,</b> is the spooﬁng by repeaters, which retransmit received GPS signals. Cases of unintentional spooﬁng by airport repeaters have already been reported, where GPS repeaters used in airport hangars, had unintentionally transmitted their signals to outside and caused ground proximity warnings at aircrafts during take-off [1]. More advanced spooﬁng techniques try to force a target receiver to a wrong position by transmission of simulated GNSS-signals. In some experiments it was already demonstrated, {{that it is possible to}} take over the control of the receiver tracking loops with advanced spooﬁng techniques [2]. Hardware simulations with GNSS-signal generators allow investigating the impact of radio interference and spooﬁng on real GNSS receivers in a systematic, parameterized and repeatable way. The behaviour of different receivers and receiver algorithms for detection and mitigation can be analyzed in dependence of interference power, distance of spoofers and other parameters. In a previous study [1] the impact of repeaters on the measured GPS position was investigated by hardware simulations and ﬁeld experiments. In this paper we concentrate on simulations of <b>meaconing</b> and spooﬁng and their impact on the Galileo receiver performance. The focus was to examine, analyse and explore the impact on the receiver raw observables in the E 1 and E 5 a bands, in particular the C/N 0 and pseudorange measurements. The simulations were carried out within the frame of SESAR WP 15. 3. 7 on multi-frequency/multi constellation GBAS. Disturbed or biased pseudorange measurements would cause the transmission of erroneous pseudorange corrections by the GBAS stations. The knowledge about the behaviour of the raw observables in dependence of different spooﬁng scenarios is also important for the development of monitors for spooﬁng detection at the ground stations. The paper describes different spooﬁng scenarios, the simulation setup and data processing and presents exemplary measurements for the results obtained. Three different spooﬁng scenarios are considered: <b>meaconing,</b> simplistic attack and intermediate up attack...|$|E

The detection of spoofing signals is achieved by comparing and statistical testing of the measured DOAs against the DOAs predicted with the ephemeris data. Because the attitude of the antenna array is assumed to be unknown and has to be estimated, the detection of spoofing signals is treated as a joint detection/estimation problem. For performing the field tests, a simple version of spoofing, so called <b>meaconing,</b> has been realized using a repeater of the in-air GNSS signals.

40|$|Spoofing {{attacks are}} {{a serious problem}} for civil GNSS {{applications}} with safety content, such as airplane landing or maritime navigation in harbors. Also many strategically important infrastructures, such as electric power grids or mobile communications networks, are becoming increasingly dependent on GNSS services. Military GNSS users solve that problem by signal encryption at chip level. This reduces the threat to only allow for <b>meaconing,</b> i. e. retransmitting the GNSS signals from a certain location, since the exact waveform is unpredictable. Civil users cannot rely on encryption at the moment and most likely in the near future. They must be protected by additional techniques, which are able to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks. A number of receiver-autonomous solutions for the spoofing problem have been proposed in the last decade. For single antenna receivers the detection of spoofing attacks can rely on the observation of the time evolution of different signal parameters such as power and Doppler frequency shift, the PRN code delay and its rates, the correlation function shape {{as well as the}} cross-correlation of the signal components at different carrier frequencies. However, the most advanced protection against the sophisticated spoofing attacks can be provided by utilizing the spatial domain for signal processing available by using antenna arrays ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]). A GNSS receiver with an antenna array is able to estimate the directions of arrival of the impinging waveforms and so to discriminate between the authentic and counterfeit signals. Moreover the malicious signals can be mitigated by generating a spatial zero into the array antenna reception pattern {{in the direction of the}} spoofing source(s). The use of the array-aided joint estimation of the array attitude and spoofing detection was investigated by the authors in [1], [3], [5]. A post-correlation estimation of the signal direction of arrival (DOA) was utilized as the first step of the corresponding signal processing chain. This approach however still suffers from the effects of short-term distortions in the receiver tracking loops and the resulting unavailability of the DOA estimations during the spoofing attack. Two approaches have been identified to overcome this effect. On the one hand, a more accurate direction of arrival detection and antenna calibration can be used. On the other hand, the attitude estimation can be made more robust by skipping the DOA estimation step and using instead directly the post-correlation array outputs in the underlining measurement model, similar to method 2 in [6]. The latter possibility will be exploited throughout the current paper. One of the main challenges here is to design robust and computationally effective attitude estimation when the post-correlation array outputs consist of the superposition of the authentic and counterfeit signals. This problem, for example, is not adequately handled in [6] and [7]. In the aforementioned approaches, the estimation of the actual direction of arrival in terms of (antenna local) azimuth and elevation was done explicitly before the attitude was estimated. The approach presented in the paper will avoid this (computationally expensive) step, by introducing an adequate measurement model. This model connects the measured relative phases between the antennas elements (spatial signature) to the ones expected from the almanac. This interconnection involves the receiver attitude, which is the state to be estimated. In a second step, the model fit (i. e. residuals of least square fit) is used to detect anomalies. Further processing is done by comparing the spatial signature for different satellites. Contrary to using the cyclic nature of PRN codes to detect the direction in the pre-correlation domain as described in [2], the spatial signature in the post-correlation domain is used. If one dominant direction is present, the likelihood of spoofing or <b>meaconing</b> is considered high. If detected, a second processing stage is triggered, capable of spatially filtering out the spoofers signature (post-correlation nulling). Finally a second run of the aforementioned procedure is done to estimate the antennas attitude using a spatially filtered signal. Theoretical results as well as hardware simulations ([8]) show, that if a GPS/CA or Galileo receiver already tracks a certain PRN, the likelihood of success is very low for an unsynchronized spoofer. In this context (un) synchronized is related to the PRNs current frequency shift (caused by the Doppler Effect), as well as code delay. The code delay error should not be larger than one chip in general. The tolerable frequency mismatch however, highly depends on the receivers implementation (i. e. FLL and PLL parameters and stages), but should not be bigger than a few multiples of 50 Hz. A synchronized spoofer or <b>meaconing</b> signal which is turned on when the receiver already tracks the corresponding PRN will be considered in the context of the paper. The described methods will be evaluated using software simulations. Scenarios without spoofing or <b>meaconing</b> are used to demonstrate the attitude estimation. Scenarios with repeaters will be used to demonstrate the two-stage approach with spatial filtering. [1]	M. Meurer, A. Konovaltsev, M. Cuntz, and C.

The research is aimed at exploring this vulnerability due to the rapidly decreasing cost and the lowering of skill barriers to launch advanced EW attacks on wireless communication systems. The first objective was to understand what current knowledge exists on the EW threat on the RF environment, allowing an understanding of this advanced threat against wireless infrastructure.

Projected toll road billing systems, ¿pay as you go¿ car insurances, and revised digital tachographs are other candidates for GNSS tracking. These devices record and report their positions. Transmissions usually occur in an expedient manner, implying near real time. The reporting intervals are determined by the application domain. The tracker sends its position messages to a public or commercial organisation that analyses such messages. Therefore, nearly all such trackers are composed of a GNSS receiver module and a wireless communications module for transmission of positions. Every such GNSS-based tracker is vulnerable to tampering, and gains from tampering depend on the application domain. This paper is concerned with surreptitious introduction of false tracking information, and the mitigation of such risk. Modelling such trackers, one identifies multiple ways that an adversary could use to introduce such false information. With sufficient development work on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform, an adversary could engineer an illegal civilian GPS spoofer that circumvents classical GPS receiver integrity checks. The intelligent abuse of SDR can also spoof the outgoing position message. Furthermore, trackers constitute embedded computing systems that have input/output ports, begetting vulnerability. If trackers use cryptography to authenticate their outgoing message, they can be subjected to ¿side channel attacks¿. Last but not least, it is possible to physically tamper with the tracker. Physical tampering includes breaching the housing of the tracker, and removing the tracker from the asset. Various options are reviewed to harden GNSS based trackers against diverse technological exploits. The paper assumes that an intact tracker is properly installed, and does not cover social engineering. The introductory chapter defines an abstract GNSS tracker.
