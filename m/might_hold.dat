25|$|The {{last four}} wickets fell quickly {{on the final}} day, when it {{appeared}} as though England <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> out for a draw against all odds. From 361/6, Stewart's dismissal heralded the final collapse, and Foster, Such and Tufnell surrendered meekly, leaving England all out on 365.|$|E

25|$|Stefan Wallin, Finland's {{minister}} {{responsible for}} church affairs, accused Päivi Räsänen, {{the leader of}} the Christian Democrats, of deliberately taking a public position against homosexuality and gay rights in order to drive away from the church those people who <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> more liberal views on gay acceptance.|$|E
25|$|If {{people had}} more than one radio, they <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> one back, or just hand in an old broken set. Other people made crystal radio sets. It was {{possible}} to make crystals, wire was available, the hardest object was a speaker. Stripping down telephone receivers, solved that problem.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, in Seattle, Washington, {{liberal and}} {{progressive}} business owners who had supported the city's new $15 minimum wage said they <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> off on expanding their businesses and thus creating new jobs, {{due to the}} uncertain timescale of the wage increase implementation. However, subsequently {{at least two of}} the business owners quoted did expand.|$|E

25|$|Some in Modern Orthodox Judaism {{reject the}} above view as naive. Some Orthodox Jews accept the earlier rabbinic {{position}} that the Zohar was a work written in the Middle Medieval Period by Moses de Leon, but argue that since it is obviously based on earlier materials, it can still be held to be authentic, but not as authoritative or without error as others within Orthodoxy <b>might</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} the pancreas's {{internal}} secretion, which, it was supposed, regulates {{sugar in the}} bloodstream, <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> {{the key to the}} treatment of diabetes. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead to atrophy of most of the pancreas, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He theorized a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once {{most of the rest of}} the pancreas was gone.|$|E

25|$|A special British Joint Intelligence Subcommittee report titled German Strategy and Capacity to Resist, {{prepared}} for Winston Churchill's eyes only, predicted that Germany might collapse {{as early as}} mid-April if the Soviets overran its eastern defenses. Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> out until November if they could prevent the Soviets from taking Silesia. Hence, any assistance provided to the Soviets on the Eastern Front could shorten the war. At the time of bombing, the Soviets were conducting their Lower Silesian Offensive.|$|E
25|$|Ryder's {{first stop}} on the search is Eos, a desert planet plagued by radiation, where Nakmor Drack and Pelessaria B'Sayle (Peebee) join the crew. With SAM's help, Ryder unlocks a Remnant vault, which houses a {{terraforming}} system that gradually repairs the planet's ecosystem to more hospitable levels. The planet's newly-improved viability allows Ryder to establish Andromeda's first successful outpost. Ryder also discovers a star chart pinpointing the location of other worlds that <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> similar structures. It is deduced that these worlds could sustain the Initiative.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual <b>might</b> <b>hold.</b> This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E

25|$|Chris Duncan misplayed another {{ball in the}} top of {{the sixth}} for a Sean Casey two-out double, but this time the runner would be {{stranded}} as Iván Rodríguez then struck out to end the inning. A David Eckstein single followed by a Preston Wilson walk in the bottom of the seventh put runners at first and second with none out for the heart of the Cardinals order: Pujols, Edmonds, and Rolen. Pujols popped out and Edmonds flied out, so it appeared Detroit <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> the Cardinals to a one-run lead. Instead, Scott Rolen singled and scored Eckstein, doubling the Cardinals lead to 4–2.|$|E
25|$|In {{the events}} of the first film, Michael is {{repeatedly}} {{caught in the middle of}} a conflict between vampire Death Dealers and Lycans, as his blood <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> a rare genetic trait needed by the Lycans for a hybrid experiment. Despite the help of Selene, he is bitten by the Lycan leader Lucian. This sets him on the path to become a Lycan, and allows Lucian to gain a blood sample to confirm that Michael has a rare genetic trait for immortality. Selene and Michael work together to evade the Lycans, and understand Michael's significance to the conflict. He is eventually captured by the Lycans, who take him to Lucian.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister's {{power to}} {{determine}} the election date can give the government some subtle advantages. For example, if governing parties believe that {{a section of the}} population will either vote against them or not at all, they <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> the election in early spring, when the weather may well keep less-committed voters away from the polls. Party strategists take the timing of important rugby union matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the election will likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a widespread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the All Blacks (the New Zealand national rugby team) win and suffer when they lose.|$|E

50|$|A {{major feature}} which sets {{overlapping}} generations models in economics {{apart from the}} standard model with {{a finite number of}} infinitely lived individuals is that the First welfare theorem <b>might</b> not <b>hold,</b> that is competitive equilibria may be not be Pareto optimal.|$|R
30|$|However, {{wireless}} {{systems have}} continuously evolved, implying that models should evolve too. While a classical deterministic model may have proved accurate for relatively narrowband cellular systems, this <b>might</b> not <b>hold</b> true {{when dealing with}} the application-oriented systems exploiting multiple dimensions (space, polarization, frequency, etc.).|$|R
25|$|Nabis' {{territorial}} ambitions {{brought him}} into conflict with the Achaean League, which controlled the northern half of the Peloponnese. Although repeatedly defeated by the gifted Achaean strategos Philopoemen, he nevertheless remained {{a serious threat to}} the Achaeans, who were considerably less successful against him when led by less competent generals. In 200 BC, alarmed at the ease with which he was ravaging their territory, the Achaeans asked the Macedonian King Philip V for help, which he did not provide. In the following years, Nabis was able to skilfully exploit the conflict between Philip and the Romans, gaining control of the important city of Argos as the price of his alliance with the Macedonians, and then defecting to the soon to be victorious Romans so that he <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> on to his conquest.|$|E
25|$|General Stone {{orders the}} {{building}} to be quarantined and District One {{to be put into}} Code Red lockdown. Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a U.S. Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.|$|E

As a result, popular revolution (or at least paralyzing instability) is always around the corner in the Arab world." [...] Proponents argued that, for that reason, the U.S. should turn its attention towards those who <b>might</b> <b>hold</b> power in a more democratic Arab world; otherwise, its relationships with Arab states will always be tenuous and unstable.|$|E
