40|$|Experts {{are putting}} out urgent {{warnings}} about a southern American fly - the screw <b>worm</b> <b>fly</b> - which has appeared {{for the first}} time in the African continent in Libya as a sheep parasite, and which is threatening cattle, domestic animals, important wildlife reserves and even people, throughout Africa. The parasite is a large yellowy red-headed fly with a metallic sheen. The female can lay up to 300 eggs in four minutes in any tiny wound. Within an hour these eggs have developed into screw-shaped larvae which then enlarge the wound and attract more egg-laying females. Serious myiatic debilitation, and even death, follow if the infection is not treated. The fly has no natural enemies other than cold and thus thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It can travel large distances, but is also transported by larvae-ridden animals. In the Americas, the screw <b>worm</b> <b>fly</b> causes hundreds of millions of dollars' damage and, although it can be eradicated by releasing males sterilized by exposure to gamma rays, this solution may be too expensive and impracticable for application in vast areas of the African continent. Last year FAO began a joint programme with Libya costing several million dollars, but it is feared that this will be too little too late. If it is not controlled the pest could become a very serious danger to wild and domestic animals in Africa.

40|$|Abstract Background A protein-protein {{interaction}} network (PIN) {{was suggested}} to be a disassortative network, in which interactions between high- and low-degree nodes are favored while hub-hub interactions are suppressed. It was postulated that a disassortative structure minimizes unfavorable cross-talks between different hub-centric functional modules and was positively selected in evolution. However, by re-examining yeast PIN data, several researchers {{reported that the}} disassortative structure observed in a PIN might be an experimental artifact. Therefore, {{the existence of a}} disassortative structure and its possible evolutionary mechanism remains unclear. Results In this study, we investigated PINs from the yeast, <b>worm,</b> <b>fly,</b> human, and malaria parasite including four different yeast PIN datasets. The analyses showed that the yeast, <b>worm,</b> <b>fly,</b> and human PINs are disassortative while the malaria parasite PIN is not. By conducting simulation studies {{on the basis of a}} duplication-divergence model, we demonstrated that a preferential duplication of low- and high-degree nodes can generate disassortative and non-disassortative networks, respectively. From this observation, we hypothesized that the difference in degree dependence on gene duplications accounts for the difference in assortativity of PINs among species. Comparison of 55 proteomes in eukaryotes revealed that genes with lower degrees showed higher gene duplicabilities in the yeast, <b>worm,</b> and <b>fly,</b> while high-degree genes tend to have high duplicabilities in the malaria parasite, supporting the above hypothesis. Conclusions These results suggest that disassortative structures observed in PINs are merely a byproduct of preferential duplications of low-degree genes, which might be caused by an organism's living environment. </p...|$|R

50|$|The theory {{behind this}} {{evolutionary}} conservation {{stems from the}} belief that some common ancestor of <b>worms,</b> <b>flies,</b> and vertebrates had a single primordial homeotic selector gene, an ancestral Hox complex, that went through repeated duplication to form a series of tandem genes. In Drosophila, this ancestral Hox complex split into two separate complexes: Antennapedia and Bithorax. In mammals, the whole complex repeatedly duplicated resulting in four Hox complexes. This theory has some faults, including that some individual genes have been duplicated while others have been lost.|$|R
