5000|$|Owing to {{its unique}} appearance, Koenig {{assigned}} the mineral {{as a new}} species. His description of the mineral appeared in an 1892 publication of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He named the mineral paramelaconite from the Greek παρά, meaning [...] "near", and the mineral <b>melaconite</b> (now known as tenorite), for its compositional similarity to <b>melaconite.</b> At the time, however, the mineral was not recognized as a valid species.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the hydrothermal, tenorite also occurs as a volcanic sublimate from Vesuvius, Campania, and Etna, Sicily, Italy. As a sublimate it occurs with copper chlorides, alkali chlorides and cotunnite. The Vesuvian sublimate occurrence was originally named melaconise or <b>melaconite</b> by F. S. Beudant in 1832.|$|E
5000|$|Paramelaconite is a rare, black-colored {{copper oxide}} mineral with formula Cu21+Cu22+O3 (or Cu4O3). It was {{discovered}} in the Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, Arizona, about 1890. It was described in 1892 and more fully in 1941. Its name {{is derived from the}} Greek word for [...] "near" [...] and the similar mineral <b>melaconite,</b> now known as tenorite.|$|E
40|$|A newly {{developed}} deposit at the Inspiration Mine has ore consisting {{of black and}} green chrysocolla. No primary copper minerals occur within the deposit. The chryso-colla is partly in rocks that are younger than the nearby major copper mineralization. We believe the chrysocolla was produced by reaction of soluble copper with silica dissolved from the volcanic glasses in the adjacent quartz-latite floxvs of the Apache Leap Formation. This is probably not a unique occurrence. Thus, chrysocolla deposits {{may be expected to}} be associated with other silica-rich flows located near sources of copper. Conversely, deposits of chrysocolla exposed at the surface may be used to locate the primary source of copper by tracing old water courses back to the primary sulfide deposits. Black chrysocolla is a manganese-rich variety of green chrysocolla (as opposed to <b>melaconite,</b> copper pitch, and tenoritc). Its X-ray properties are indistinguishable from the green variety. Results of thermal studies show that there is a greater similarity between the green and black varieties at a given deposit, than between specimens of like color from different deposits...|$|E
