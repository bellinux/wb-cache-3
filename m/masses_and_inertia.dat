40|$|Abstract - Passive {{stabilization}} can drastically {{simplify the}} design of attitude control systems of Earth-oriented satellites with moderate pointing requirements. Long tethers are attractive for passive attitude stabilization because, {{at the expense of}} a small mass increment, they provide strong restoring torques about the roll and pitch axes of the satellite. Consequently, reaction wheels and thrusters for pitch and roll control can be eliminated, thereby saving propellant mass in direct proportion to the mission duration. The attainable pointing accuracies, the <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia</b> ratios required for passive attitude stabilization are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Numerical results are derived for low and geostationary Earth's orbits for a class of small satellites...|$|E

The corresponding rigid body model includes all <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia</b> tensors. Control torques allowing a symmetrical straight ahead gait with pre-swing, swing and heel-contact are derived by dynamic optimization using a direct collocation approach. The computed torques minimize {{the absolute value}} of the mechanical power consumption in the joints of the biped. Zero moment point (ZMP) and friction conditions at the feet ensuring postural stability of the biped, as well as bounds on the joint angles and on the control torques, are treated as constraints. The resulting biped motion is dynamically stable and the overall motion behaviour is remarkably close to that of humans. ...|$|E

30|$|The sensitivities of doe {{analysis}} {{show that}} {{an increase in}} the stiffness or damping has a direct effect on car body acceleration, while it has an opposite/inverse effect on car body displacement. This is an expected result for any dynamic system: as stiffness and/or damping increase, the corresponding forces and hence accelerations also increase. In the standard specification, limits for car body acceleration can be found (UIC 513, UIC 518, BS EN 12299, and ISO 2631). However, car body displacement is a function of characteristic features of the rail vehicle such as suspension properties, <b>masses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia.</b> Therefore, the standard specifications do not really define the limits for displacements. For this reason, the suspension designer shall check and determine the bounds for displacements of rail vehicle components by considering real constraints on displacements.|$|E

The modeling scheme developed in this paper is based on Kane's dynamical equations and takes account of both the platform's and the supporting legs ' <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia.</b> A computer program is reported which implements this scheme to determine the actuator forces needed to produce desired platform trajectories.

Many different approaches have been taken, anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic ones. Not only the mechanical structure of such systems was investigated, but also the necessary control system. With the human hand as an exemplar, such robot systems use their hands to grasp diverse objects without the {{need to change the}} gripper.

40|$|To assist or {{rehabilitate}} {{individuals with}} impaired upper-limb function, {{we have developed}} an upper-limb exoskeleton robot, the ETS-MARSE (motion assistive robotic-exoskeleton for superior extremity). The MARSE is comprised of a shoulder motion support part, an elbow and forearm motion support part, and a wrist motion support part. It {{is designed to be}} worn on the lateral side of the upper limb in order to provide naturalistic movements of the shoulder (i. e., vertical and horizontal flexion/extension, and internal/external rotation), elbow (i. e., flexion/extension), forearm (i. e., pronation/supination), and wrist joint (i. e., radial/ulnar deviation, and flexion/extension). This thesis focuses on the modeling, design (mechanical and electrical components), development, and control of the developed MARSE. The proposed MARSE was modeled based on the upper-limb biomechanics; it has a relatively low weight, an excellent power/weight ratio, can be easily fitted or removed, and is able to effectively compensate for gravity. Moreover, to avoid complex cable routing that could be found in many exoskeleton systems, a novel power transmission mechanism was introduced for assisting shoulder joint internal/external rotation and for forearm pronation/supination. The exoskeleton was designed for use by typical adults. However, provisions are included for link length adjustments to accommodate a wide range of users. The entire exoskeleton arm was fabricated primarily in aluminum except the high stress joint sections which were fabricated in mild steel to give the exoskeleton structure a relatively light weight. Brushless DC motors (incorporated with Harmonic Drives) were used to actuate the developed MARSE. The kinematic model of the MARSE was developed based on modified Denavit-Hartenberg notations. In dynamic modeling and control, robot parameters such as robot arm link lengths, upper-limb <b>masses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia,</b> are estimated according to the upper limb properties of a typical adult. Though the exoskeleton was developed with the goal of providing different forms of rehab therapy (namely passive arm movements, active-assisted therapy, and resistive therapy), this research concentrated only on passive form of rehabilitation. Passive arm movements and exercises are usually performed slowly compared to the natural speed of arm movement. Therefore, to control the developed MARSE, a computationally inexpensive a PID controller and a PID-based compliance controller were primarily employed. Further, realizing the dynamic modeling of human arm movement which is nonlinear in nature, a nonlinear computed torque control (CTC) and a modified sliding mode exponential reaching law (mSMERL) techniques were employed to control the MARSE. Note that to improve transient tracking performance and to reduce chattering, this thesis proposed the mSMERL, a novel nonlinear control strategy that combined the concept of boundary layer technique and the exponential reaching law. The control architecture was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with a RT-PC. In experiments, typical rehabilitation exercises for single and multi joint movements (e. g., reaching) were performed. Experiments were carried out with healthy human subjects where trajectories (i. e., pre-programmed trajectories recommended by therapist/clinician) tracking the form of passive rehabilitation exercises were carried out. This thesis also focused on the development of a 7 DoFs upper-limb prototype (lower scaled) ‘master exoskeleton arm’ (mExoArm). Furthermore, experiments were carried out with the mExoArm where subjects (robot users) operate the mExoArm (like a joystick) to maneuver the MARSE to provide passive rehabilitation. Experimental results show that the developed MARSE can effectively perform passive rehabilitation exercises for shoulder, elbow and wrist joint movements. Using mExoArm offers users some flexibility over pre-programmed trajectories selection approach, especially in choosing range of movement and speed of motion. Moreover, the mExoArm could potentially be used to tele-operate the MARSE in providing rehabilitation exercises...|$|E

In author's knowledge, the topic is not covered in recent marine engineering literature, {{probably due to the}} very few possible applications. In fact the problem of a vessel with a variable mass and/or inertia is not common in marine engineering. Classic applications refer to submarines during immersion and emersion manoeuvres. A field of application of wider interest is the simulation of flooding and its influence on the damaged ship stability. Another possible application is the ship motion control by passive water tanks. The authors faced this kind of problem dealing with the simulation of an high speed craft; to assure the static stability at zero speed a large quantity of ballast water is loaded during deceleration and to assure good speed performance it is unloaded during acceleration, producing a rapid change in <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia</b> of the vessel. The paper focusses on the analytical derivation of the “inertial part” of the equations of motion, taking explicitly into account the variability of <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>inertia.</b> The aim is to provide the theoretical basis for works concerning the numerical simulation of propulsion and motion for vessels. Among others, two important findings are noticed: • the derived equations, in matrix form, maintain the same structure of the constant mass equations but contain an additional term, • the Kirchhoff's equations hold also for the variable mass case.
