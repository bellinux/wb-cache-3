50|$|The second {{update to}} the arena {{took place in}} 2002-2003, when the Sabres {{replaced}} <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> {{on the face of}} the second bowl with a LED ribbon. The original seamless glass boards were also removed, and replaced with boards with clear plastic stanchions, which gave when players were hit into them.|$|E
5000|$|A $33 million {{renovation}} in 2006 and 2007 {{brought new}} spectator seating throughout the venue, including chair back seating in select areas, and additional visitor-side seating. A state-of-the-art FieldTurf surface, lights, and a press box were installed, and improved restroom and vending areas were also included. A 19-by-35 foot video <b>matrix</b> <b>board,</b> {{located in the}} northwest corner of the stadium, provides the Lafayette Sports Network telecast of the game and features [...] "in-house" [...] entertainment for Leopard fans.|$|E
50|$|Northlands Coliseum was {{the first}} NHL arena in Canada to have a centre-hung {{scoreboard}} with an electronic messageboard; the original scoreboard including a black-and-white dot <b>matrix</b> <b>board.</b> This was replaced in 1987 by a centre-hung scoreboard with a colour matrix screen, which in 1994 was replaced with an eight-sided scoreboard with four video screens. The current centre-hung scoreboard, designed by White Way Sign, features eight message boards {{at the top and}} four video screens at the bottom, separated by LED rings. The arena also features 360-degree fascia signage by Daktronics.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, color <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> were {{installed}} on the scoreboard; these were replaced by four Sony JumboTron video walls three years later, when the <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> {{were placed in the}} corners of the fascia. In 2006, LED video screens replaced the JumboTrons. The screens debuted November 22, 2006, when the Red Wings played the Vancouver Canucks. That same day, the arena's West Entrance was named the [...] "Gordie Howe Entrance" [...] in honor of the legendary Red Wing player, and a bronze statue of Howe was placed inside the entrance. Joe Louis Arena currently houses 86 premium suites. In 2008, the arena introduced the Comerica Bank Legend's Club, a 181-person private seating location in the southeast corner of the arena.|$|R

50|$|The arena has {{undergone}} $11 million of renovations since 2003, including {{the replacement of}} a center-hung scoreboard with a matrix screen on each side with a center-hung scoreboard with LED video and <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> and two LED end-zone videoboards in 2008. A new glass wall has been installed, {{and is expected to}} be extended in order to expand the arena's main concourse at a cost of $3.5 million in 2014. This would result in additional restrooms and concession stands at the arena.|$|R
50|$|For the 2012 season, a new {{scoreboard}} by Fair Play Scoreboards {{and video}} board by Trans-Lux were added. It {{is capable of}} displaying a host of multimedia from the internet, including live TV, {{and is able to}} display over 280 million colors. The largest video board for a high school stadium in the state is equipped with a video room onsite to cut to multiple game camera angles, and instant replays (with multiple angles); in addition, a ribbon full <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> (the first for a high school facility in the nation) lines the press box separating the two levels capable of showing game, player, and statistical information.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the Mud Hens {{installed}} new ribbon scoreboards {{along the}} first base and third base {{sides of the}} ballpark. They are in color and can display a variety of graphics, stats, and the game score. Also, the Mud Hens replaced their Fair Play Scoreboards scoreboard and Barco video board with a Daktronics video board display in left field which is in color and is a complete <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> that shows the line score of the game. It is also zoned on the top 70% where it shows the current batter, animations, games and replays. The new Daktronics video board also replaced the Fair Play message board below the old Fair Play scoreboard.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of the 1968 renovations, a centre-hung digital scoreclock was installed, {{designed}} by the Day Sign Company of Toronto and similar to those installed at the Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium during the 1970s. A new centre-hung scoreclock, designed by Daktronics, was installed in the mid-1980s and contained on each side a color <b>matrix</b> <b>board.</b> Along with one other Original Six indoor ice hockey arena, the Boston Garden, the Montreal Forum used a high-pitched siren to signal the end of an NHL game's period — the siren would later be re-installed in the Forum's successor facility, the Bell Centre (and still in use there), much as the TD Garden in Boston inherited the lower-pitched Garden's siren. A Rainforest Cafe was supposed to open, but never got built since the building closed.|$|E
50|$|Seattle Mariners - 2011ANC {{replaced}} {{a series}} of static sponsor signs and old-fashioned incandescent light <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> at Safeco Field with state-of-the-art LED boards. The new boards are on the fascia of the Wells Fargo Terrace Club stretching from {{the edges of the}} Press Box down the first and third base lines, and above the Lower Outfield Reserved seats in right field. They will utilize ANC's patent-pending VisionSOFT technology. This is the second project in which the Mariners partners with ANC.

5000|$|The new high-definition {{scoreboard}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} features to be installed. [...] It replaced both the old <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> in the shape of the Royals logo that had been in the park since its opening, along with the video board that had been installed in 1989. The new scoreboard was ready for Opening Day 2008. It is 84 ft. wide and 105 ft. tall, and was, at the time it entered service, the largest high-definition LED display in the world. The Kauffman Stadium screen was eventually surpassed by the new scoreboard at Seattle's Safeco Field in 2013. The display was assembled in 55 separate segments, including an active bottom taper to resemble the shield in the Royals logo. The video scoreboard alone cost $8.3 million, and the control room that operates it is staffed with 17 people on game days. [...] It was adorned with a crown during the 2008 offseason. Strobe lights atop the scoreboard flash after every Royals home run.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work explores the Electromagnetic and Acoustic Properties of Smoke Particulates from real fires, {{and the initial}} development of an alternative method of smoke detection based on the study work. The research was entirely self-funded including {{the purchase of the}} experimental apparatus, test equipment and calibration to international standards. The study includes the properties of solid and liquid post combustion particulates in air suspension forming smoke plumes, and the associated fluid flow dynamics. As part of the study the electromagnetic and acoustic properties of smoke particulates, a somewhat unique detection method described as the ''Double <b>Matrix</b> <b>Board</b> System'' was developed and used. It was initially developed to assist in the electromagnetic study work, and was later modified to examine the acoustic properties.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new architecture, called ”Power Electronics Remote Wiring and Measurement Laboratory (PermLAB) ”, that translates a {{common gateway interface}} (CGI) string from a remote web user to a web server connected to a 3 -dimension switching <b>matrix</b> <b>board,</b> {{can be used to}} switch on and off, and to control a cluster of instruments and components. PermLAB addresses real-time connection, switching, and data acquisition over the Internet instead of using simulated data. A software procedure uses a signature system to identify each instrument and component in a complex system. The Web-server application is developed in HTML, JavaScript and Java, and in C language for the CGI interface, which resides in a controller portion of LabVIEW. The LabVIEW software fully integrates the Web sever, LabVIEW data acquisition boards and controllers, and the 3 -dimensional switching <b>matrix</b> <b>board.</b> The paper will analyze a half-wave rectifier (AC – DC converter) circuit connected over the Internet using the PermLAB. PermLAB allows students to obtain real data by real-time wiring of real circuits in the laboratory using a “virtual breadboard ” on the Web. The software for the Web-based 3 -dimensional system is flexible, portable, can be integrated into many laboratory applications or expanded, and easily accessible worldwide...|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, more than 200 theatre-type {{reserved}} seats were added {{in front of}} the press tower, bringing the seating capacity to 6,700. Aluminum seating replaced the original wooden seats. A scoreboard featuring an electronic <b>matrix</b> message <b>board</b> was added before the 1994 season.|$|R
50|$|After the 1998 {{redesign}} of the roof, the facility underwent a smaller renovation in 2006, when the university updated {{some of the}} foldable seating and replaced the four scoreboards located above Gates 1 through 4 in each corner of the arena. The old dot <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> were removed and replaced by modern video boards that could display instant replays and video presentations. Following the men's basketball team's victory in the national title game of the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, the University Athletic Association (UAA) bought the temporary hardwood floor that had been installed in the now-demolished Indianapolis RCA Dome for the Final Four. Although the national finals logos were removed by sanding, the basketball teams now play on the same lumber on which the Gators won their first basketball national championship. The UAA also bought the court used to win their second title from the Georgia Dome in 2007, and displayed it in the O'Connell Center during their championship celebration event, and later sold it in pieces {{to raise funds for}} scholarships.|$|R
5000|$|Several generous gifts {{resulted}} in {{the addition of a}} new playing field and a brand-new facility for the football team, the Frank H. Kenan Football Center, named for the great-grandson of the stadium's original benefactor. The Kenan Center included a memorabilia section showcasing the football program's history. The most visible addition, however, was 8,000 new seats in the west end zone, which turned the stadium into a horseshoe. Also added was a [...] "preferred seating box" [...] atop the north stands. Due to state law, only 6,000 of the new end zone seats were available in 1997. Capacity dropped to 48,500 in 1996, but leaped to 57,800 in 1997. The other 2,200 seats were added in 1998, bringing the stadium to a capacity of 60,000, not eclipsed until the 2011 season. In 2003, a modern scoreboard with video capability was added in front of Kenan Field House. The next addition came before the 2007 season, when the old <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> on the sidelines were replaced with ribbon boards.|$|R
40|$|The {{product-service system}} (PSS) {{is a system}} in which its {{integrated}} products and services jointly fulfill customer needs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to create a one sensor high resolution acoustic emission measurement system. To obtain this goal, two low noise and distortion amplifiers are designed, with gains of 46 dB and 60 dB. Gain could be reduced by 6 dB using relay switched voltage dividers. Amplified signal then goes to active low pass 7 th order filter, unbalanced to balanced signal converter and finally to 16 bits analog to digital converter (ADC). Those circuits, together with six power supply regulators (three of them are used for ADC power supply), are layout on single printed circuit board (PCB), which consist of approximately 170 elements. In addition, another PCB is designed to reduce electromagnetic interference of field programmable gate array (FPGA) <b>matrix.</b> <b>Board</b> uses an optic decouples and differential line for the data transfer (to and from ADC) in order that noisy “ground” loops would not occur.

5000|$|In its later life, the {{building}} saw several changes: a new floor {{was installed in}} 1998, rear-projection video monitors replaced the <b>matrix</b> <b>boards</b> {{at the turn of}} the new millennium, and the student seating plan was also altered. Before Quin Snyder came to coach the Tigers, student seating was scattered throughout the arena and distributed via who picked up tickets first, and while the largest amount sat along one sideline (including the band, Student Athletic Board and the aforementioned Antlers), others sat as high as the D sections, which early in the arena's life doubled as lecture halls (to this day, their seats have fold-out writing desks). Attempting to create an atmosphere similar to his former employers, Duke, Snyder mandated that all students be moved to one end of the court, where bleachers would replace the old seats and primacy would be given to his new [...] "Zou Crew" [...] club, with all other seating areas becoming general admission. The move was criticized for changing the atmosphere at Missouri games to something less distinctive while enabling more seats to be sold at a higher cost, but was duplicated (with more restrictions on student seating) at Mizzou Arena.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses a Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) device {{suitable for}} use in a range of applications from DC, such as switching electrical signal lines, to RF applications such as tunable capacitors and switches. In an embodiment of the invention, the device comprises a bottom substrate and a top substrate separated at a fixed distance from each other. Disposed between the substrates is a flexible S-shaped membrane having an electrode or an electrically conducting electrode layer with one end attached to the top substrate and the other end in contact with the bottom substrate. An electrically conducting contact block is attached to the underside of the membrane actuator for short circuiting a signal line when the switch is in the closed position. When a voltage is applied between the membrane and an electrode layer on the bottom substrate, the membrane is induced by electrostatic force to deflect in a rolling wave-like motion such that the contact block is displaced into contact with the signal line. The device can be actively opened when a voltage is applied between the membrane actuator and a electrode layer on the top substrate causing the contact block to displace upward breaking contact with the signal line. The MEMS switching device is applicable {{for use in a}} switch <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> for automatically switching telephone lines or in RF applications {{in the form of a}} tunable capacitor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to create an {{improvement}} of a normal trash can using an embedded systemintegrated with a solar panel that aims to improve the disposal practices of schoolchildren and improve the awareness of the students about the emerging capability of solar power. To use the system, the user needs to scan the material of the garbage then the chamber opens depending on what type of material was scanned. As the chamber opens, the user throws the trash inside the chamber, it has 10 seconds to dispose of the trash then the chamber will automatically close. A message appears in the <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> whether the user had successfully disposed of the trash. The framework of the system discusses the procedure in constructing the propose project. It consists of the input, the processes, and the output. Inputs consist of the software and the hardware requirements. A vital part of the software development is the coding of the embedded system and on hardware development is the construction of the mechanism, after this phase the user tests it for possible enhancement and revision to be incorporated in the mechanism. The output of the system must be a fully functional mechanism that can be executed completely by the user. Upon thorough research, the proponents developed a Solar Powered Electronic Trash Can that helps school-children in proper disposing of their trash. This can also affects the pollution rating by means of proper trash segregation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} this thesis work is the {{telehealth}} monitoring with specific focus on remote sleep monitoring. This thesis activity {{was carried out in}} the Advanced System Technology (AST) division, Remote Monitoring group of STMicroelectronics, which is involved in the study and development of wearable devices for the collection of physiological parameters. The main objective of this tesis is the development of an EEG wireless sensor, to be integrated in a wireless sensor network for sleep monitoring, with the minimum channels number required to characterize the microstructure of sleep, by using a chip developed at STMicroelectronics, HM 121, not yet available on the market. The chip HM 121 is an integrated bio-potential acquisition system originally designed for the ECG and body-impedance signal acquisition. A preliminary feasibility study is conduced to define the minimum number of channels necessary for the sleep classification purpose and from this analysis the choise of using one EEG channel and one EOG channel is proposed and the electrodes positioning is defined. Thus the design of a low-noise pre-amplifier stage to adapt the input dynamic range of EEG and EOG signals to that of HM 121 is developed. Design, simulations and noise analysis of the pre-amplifier stage are developed. The prototyping stage consists in the assembly of the pre-amplifier on a <b>matrix</b> <b>board</b> and in its connection to a PCB board developed at STMicroelectronics which embeds HM 121 and other sensors. Assembly strategies and bench tests to validate the system functioning are completely conduced. The developed hardware platform allows the data transmission to a smartphone App through a Bluetooth module. The package for the prototype is developed and the wearability of the system is studied. The in-vivo tests during sleep nights show that the system is able to clearly distinguish the typical waveforms of the different sleep stages. The developed prototype is a wearable and unobtrusive device, easily self-applicable by untrained people on the forehead and the essential aspect is that it may substitute the classical and extremely cumbersome polysomnography exam for sleep monitoring...|$|E

40|$|The proton-proton beam {{crossing}} at the LHC accelerator at CERN {{will have}} a rate of 40 MHz at the project luminosity. The ATLAS Trigger System has been designed in three levels in order to select only interesting physics events reducing from that rate of 40 MHz to the foreseen storage rate of about 200 Hz. The First Level reduces the output rate to about 100 kHz. The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer {{has been designed to}} perform stand-alone triggering and measurement of muon transverse momentum up to 1 TeV/c with good resolution (from 3 % at 10 GeV/c up to 10 % at 1 TeV/c). In the Barrel region of the Muon Spectrometer the Level- 1 trigger is given by means of three layers of Resistive Plate Chamber detectors (RPC) : a gaseous detector working in avalanche mode composed by two plates of high-resistivity bakelite and two orthogonal planes of read-out strips. The logic of the Level- 1 barrel muon trigger is based on the search of patterns of RPC hits in the three layers consistent with a high transverse momentum muon track originated from the interaction vertex. The associated trigger electronics is based on dedicated processors, the Coincidence <b>Matrix</b> <b>boards,</b> performing space coincidences and time gates and providing the RPC readout as well. A detailed simulation of the ATLAS Experiment and of both the hardware components and the logic of the Level- 1 Muon Trigger in the barrel of the Muon Spectrometer has been performed. This simulation has been used not only to evaluate the performances of the system but also to define the hardware set-up such as the cabling of both the trigger detectors and the trigger electronics modules. A description of both the Level- 1 Muon Trigger system in the barrel and the RPC detectors, with their cosmic rays quality tests, will be presented together with the trigger performances and rates calculations evaluated for muons over a wide range of pT and preliminary studies on the impact of accidental triggers due to low energy background particles in the experimental area...|$|R
