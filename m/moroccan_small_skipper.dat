50|$|Skipperlings are {{butterflies}} in the subfamily Heteropterinae. With about 150 described species, {{this is one}} {{of several}} <b>smaller</b> <b>skipper</b> butterfly subfamilies.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{butterflies}} are recorded which include <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> common blue, and there are local rarities such as grayling and brown argus reported.|$|R
50|$|This is a <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (wingspan 18-24 mm) {{with tiny}} white {{markings}} on dark brown wings. Very {{little is known}} about the ecology of this species and the larval food plant is unknown.|$|R
5|$|Rough {{grassland}} {{with false}} oat-grass, Yorkshire fog, yarrow, cat's ear, with bracken {{at the south}} end. There is an uneven hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn. The sunny south-west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue, Essex <b>skipper</b> and <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{the plant}} is an {{important}} source of food for the European goldfinch, honey bee, lime-speck pug moth, and the following butterflies: large <b>skipper,</b> meadow brown, <b>small</b> heath, painted lady, peacock, red admiral, small copper and <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|R
50|$|Atalopedes campestris (called the sachem in the United States) is a <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> butterfly. It is {{just over}} 1 in long and has orange-and-brown adults. Females are {{slightly}} larger and have paler markings on their wings compared to males.|$|R
5000|$|Rough {{grassland}} {{with false}} oat-grass, Yorkshire fog, yarrow, cat's ear, with bracken {{at the south}} end. There is an uneven hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn. The sunny south-west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue, Essex <b>skipper</b> and <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|R
50|$|With a {{wingspan}} of 2.5 to 2.9 cm, it is {{very similar}} in appearance to the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> Thymelicus sylvestris. They can be told apart by the undersides of the tips of their antennae: the Essex skipper's antennae are black, whereas those of the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> are orange. This butterfly occurs {{throughout much of the}} Palaearctic region. Its range is from southern Scandinavia through Europe to North Africa and east to Central Asia It was only identified in the UK in 1889, and its range is expanding both in England and in northern Europe. In North America, this butterfly was accidentally introduced in 1910 via London, Ontario and has spread across southern Canada and into several northern US states.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} skipperling {{is smaller}} than the least skipper (it is also the <b>smallest</b> <b>skipper</b> in the United States) and {{the underside of the}} hindwing has a white ray which runs the width of the hindwing from the basal area to the margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} {{part of the}} medieval Royal Forest of Rockingham. It has diverse habitats, with hay meadows, parkland and recently planted woodland. There are many butterflies such as large <b>skippers,</b> orange-tips, <b>small</b> <b>skippers</b> and <b>small</b> coppers. Mammals include baders and red foxes.|$|R
50|$|Holcus lanatus in {{its natural}} habitat is a food source for {{butterflies}} such as the speckled wood, the wall, and especially the <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b> It is rarely utilized by the Essex skipper. In its native range it may occur in plant associations such as the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow habitat.|$|R
50|$|These are <b>small,</b> brown <b>skippers</b> {{that have}} thin, {{translucent}} spots on their wings.|$|R
50|$|Insect life is also {{rich and}} varied, {{with more than}} 20 kinds of {{butterfly}} seen on the reserve, including ringlet, common blue, holly blue, peacock, red admiral, painted lady, green-veined white, comma, gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> large skipper, meadow brown, purple hairstreak, small heath and small copper and, rarely, brimstone and clouded yellow. There {{is also a great}} variety of damselflies and dragonflies.|$|R
50|$|The {{north-eastern}} end has older {{monuments and}} is wooded with mature cedar and yew trees. Wildflowers include common knapweed and lady's bedstraw, while brambles and roses climb the tombs in wilder areas. The burial ground {{is a very}} good site for butterflies, such as gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> and meadow brown. The south-western area is more managed with mown grass, and some graves have flowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} is of {{national}} importance due its rare Magnesian limestone geology. The wildflower meadows and grasslands are the favourable habitats for many butterflies, {{such as the}} large <b>skipper,</b> the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> and the dingy skipper. Plants include Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry) and Blackstonia perfoliata (yellow-wort). Looking {{to the north and}} east, there are good views of the Cleadon Hills and the North Sea coast.|$|R
50|$|Trombidium breei is {{a species}} of red mite in the genus Trombidium in the family Trombidiidae. It is found in Europe. The larvae are parasites/hosts of certain {{butterflies}} (Lepidoptera), particularly meadow brown (Maniola jurtina), gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus), marbled white (Melanargia galathea), common blue (Polyommatus icarus) and <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus sylvestris). They attach themselves to the thorax or legs of the butterfly and transfer from host to host when the butterflies alight to nectar at flowers.|$|R
50|$|The Swettenham Meadows {{reserve is}} managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. It covers {{an area of}} 21.5 acres (8.6 ha) and its species-rich {{grassland}} is particularly ecologically important as this type of habitat represents only 0.15% of the total land area of Cheshire. Common spotted orchid and marsh orchid thrive in the wet flushes of this highly variable grassland. Other important species include <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> common blue, <b>small</b> copper and orange tip butterflies, kingfishers, amphibians, and various Odonata.|$|R
50|$|The hill is the Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve {{managed by}} Natural England. This {{unimproved}} chalk downland {{is home to}} a number of butterfly species, including the Adonis blue, chalkhill blue, common blue, dark green fritillary, Essex skipper, marbled white, meadow brown, silver-spotted <b>skipper,</b> <b>small</b> heath, <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> and the speckled wood. There is also a diverse bird population, including the European green woodpecker, commonly seen feeding amongst the many anthills (which are also very important for the lifecycle of the Lycaenidae butterflies) and the turtle dove. Many species of orchid {{can be found on the}} hill or in the immediate vicinity including the fly, bee and frog orchids.|$|R
50|$|Pyrgus scriptura, the <b>small</b> {{checkered}} <b>skipper,</b> is {{a species}} of skipper (family Hesperiidae). It is found from the Texas to Montana, southeastern Alberta, and southwestern Saskatchewan.|$|R
5000|$|The lake is {{the home}} or {{breeding}} area of many birds. Kentish plover, lesser short-toed lark, lesser kestrel, crane, gull-billed tern and great bustard are among the common birds of the lake [...] According to pre-1990 figures the number of birds of the lake exceed 76000. It has been speculated that the short wave transmitter station of Turkish Radio and Television Corporation which is situated north of the lake may reduce this number. [...] <b>Small</b> <b>skipper</b> is the common butterfly around the lake area ...|$|R
500|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of , and {{the female}} 25 to 28mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus. Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma), large <b>skipper</b> (Ochlodes sylvanus), <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus sylvestris) and Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|R
50|$|Hesperilla crypsigramma, the <b>small</b> dingy <b>skipper</b> or wide-brand sedge-skipper, is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. It is found in Australia in New South Wales, Northern Territory and Queensland.|$|R
50|$|It has a rusty orange colour to the wings, {{upper body}} and {{the tips of the}} antennae. The body is silvery white below and it has a {{wingspan}} of 25-30 mm. This butterfly is very similar in appearance to the Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola). In the <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> the undersides of the tips of the antennae are yellow orange, whereas they are black in the Essex skipper. The black area on the lower edge of the upper wings also differs. Like the other orange grass skippers the male has a distinctive black stripe made up of scent scales.|$|R
50|$|When sailing small {{dinghies}} (rather than keelboats), {{the crew}} hiking or trapezing - essentially {{hanging off the}} side - {{is an important factor}} in keeping the boat upright and sailing it fast. A tall sailor can get their centre of gravity further out, thus providing more righting moment. For example, in the 470 class, only the crew is on trapeze, so it is beneficial to have a taller crew and a <b>smaller</b> <b>skipper</b> (because the boat requires a light overall weight). Australia's top crew of Matt Belcher and Malcolm Page exemplify this at 1.7 m and 1.85 m respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of 24 to 27 mm, and {{the female}} 25 to 28 mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus.

50|$|The {{extensive}} landscaped {{gardens are}} popular with visitors throughout the year. The most visited areas include {{the rose garden}} and the dahlia garden, which contain many dozens of varieties. Out of season the spring garden and winter dell are famed nationally, particularly in February when the snowdrops first appear.The lawns of the South Park are mown less frequently and this allows the many wildflowers to flower and set seed. Over 50 species of wildflower have been recorded, including bee orchid, twayblade, pyramidal orchid and common spotted orchid. In mid-summer, there are large numbers of butterflies such as meadow brown, gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skippers</b> and marbled whites.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in strings on the stems of grasses where they remain over the winter. The Essex skipper's favoured foodplant is cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and it rarely uses the <b>small</b> <b>skipper's</b> favoured foodplant Yorkshire fog. Essex skippers' other foods include {{creeping}} soft grass (Holcus mollis), couch grass (Elymus repens), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum). This skipper's caterpillars emerge {{in the spring and}} feed until June before forming shelters from leaves tied with silk {{at the base of the}} foodplant to pupate. Adults fly from July through August. Like most skippers, they are fairly strictly diurnal, though individuals are very rarely encountered during the night.|$|R
50|$|Semalea atrio, the <b>small</b> silky <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Hesperiidae family. It {{is found in}} Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, {{the eastern part of}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo and north-western Tanzania. The habitat consists of primary forests.|$|R
50|$|This {{and other}} Baccharis species are nectar sources {{for most of}} the predatory wasps, native <b>skippers</b> (<b>small</b> butterflies), and native flies in their ranges.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the City of York Council {{designated}} Acomb Wood and Meadow as a Statutory Local Nature Reserve. This is {{the larger}} {{part of the}} area known as Acomb Wood. The western portion {{is located on the}} other side of Acomb Wood Drive and is managed by the Woodland Trust. The East Wood covers approximately 10 acres and the West Wood about 3 acres. A variety of birds have been seen in the woods, including the great spotted woodpecker, tawny owls, nuthatch, coal tit, long-tailed tit, robin, thrush, willow warbler and tree-creepers. Among the species of trees found here are ash, sycamore and poplar. There are also many species of flora including the uncommon sanicle and twayblade. The Old Hay Meadow in the East Wood is home to <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> common blue and small copper butterflies.|$|R
50|$|These <b>small</b> to {{medium-sized}} <b>skippers</b> are {{brown on}} the upperside and yellow brown on the underside. They have a yellow patch on the upperside forewing.|$|R
50|$|Service in Madras allowed Hopkins {{to pursue}} his {{interest}} in butterfly collecting. He sent a fellow-naturalist, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Brigadier) William Harry Evans, D.S.O., R.E., some specimens of a <b>small</b> Sarangesa (<b>skipper)</b> he had caught during the cold season at St. Thomas Mount in Madras, which were considered new to science and were ultimately described as Sarangesa hopkinsi, Evans 1921.|$|R
