40|$|The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) {{has become}} a widely used method to measure trace gases in the atmosphere. DOAS-systems {{normally}} employ slotted disk arrangements, where a narrow slit scans the spectrum produced by a spectrometer. With photodiode array detectors (PDA) {{it is possible to}} record all wavelength in the observed interval simultaneously. But unfortunately these detectors show much higher residual structures. It was the aim of this project to eliminate these structures and thus make this kind of detectors useable for the measurement of atmospheric trace gases. It could be showned that the angular dependence of the PDA response is responsible for the higher residual structure. With the development of a quartz fiber <b>mode</b> <b>mixer</b> it was possible to eliminate the residual structure. Furthermore the possibility of the use of CCD-cameras have been tested in field and laboratory-measurements. A new algorithm for the analysis of atmospheric absorption spectra was developed. The algorithm corrects differences in the wavelength-pixel mapping of the spectra, caused by temperature changes of the spectrometer. It also estimates the errors of the concentrations considers the uncertainty of this correction and the influence of random residual structures.

40|$|Due to {{imperfection}} of {{the single}} path absorption, ECRH at ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) is always accompanied by stray radiation in the vacuum vessel. New ECRH scenarios with O 2 and X 3 heating schemes extend the operational space, but they have also the potential to increase the level of stray radiation. There are hazards for invessel components. Damage on electric cables has already been encountered. It is therefore necessary to monitor and control the ECRH {{with respect to the}} stray radiation level. At AUG a system of Sniffer antennas equipped with microwave detection diodes is installed. The system is part of the ECRH interlock circuit. We notice, however, that during plasma operation the variations of the Sniffer antenna signal are very large. In laboratory measurements we see variations of up to 20 dB in the directional sensitivity and we conclude that an interference pattern is formed inside the copper sphere of the antenna. When ECRH is in plasma operation at AUG, the plasma is acting as a phase and <b>mode</b> <b>mixer</b> for the millimeter waves and thus the interference pattern inside the sphere changes with the characteristic time of the plasma dynamics.

40|$|With the {{capability}} of achieving high breakdown voltage and high current density at microwave frequencies, the AlGaN/GaN based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) becomes a promising candidate for RF/microwave power amplifiers. Recently there are increasing interests in extending the utilization of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs to other RF/microwave front-end building blocks such as LNAs, VCOs, mixers, and switches. The conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are depletion-mode (D-mode) devices featuring negative threshold voltage. This characteristic requires a negative DC power supply in the system in order to pinch off the device. Thus RF/microwave circuits using these devices require both the negative and positive voltage supplies, which lead to increased circuit complexity and system cost. The enhancement-mode (E-mode) AlGaN/GaN HEMT with positive threshold voltage can lead to circuits with single supply voltage, but has been challenging to develop because of the inherently strong charge polarization in III-nitride material system {{and the lack of}} reliable and low-cost gate-recess techniques. We have recently developed a novel and robust approach, namely the fluoride-based plasma treatment technique which can effectively convert D-mode HEMT to E-mode HEMT without degrading other device characteristics. This achievement makes the elimination of the negative DC power supply doable in AlGaN/GaN based applications. In this thesis, design, fabrication and characterization were carried out in applying the E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMTs to dual-gate mixers, MSM varactors and LNAs. The dual-gate mixer feature an E-mode gate as the LO port and a D-mode gate as the RF port, with both gates biased at positive voltages. This configuration not only help eliminate the negative power supply but also provide the dual-gate mixer a better performance with low VDD bias when only positive bias is available. When positive and low voltage VDD (1 ~ 3 V) is applied, the E/D-mode dual-gate mixer shows higher conversion gain than the D/D <b>mode</b> dual-gate <b>mixer</b> at 2 GHz. For the MSM inter-digitated varactors, various electrode configurations including E/D, E/E and D/D were investigated. It is found that the D/E configuration features a smoother capacitance tuning profile and lower tuning voltages compared with the conventional D/D configuration. A monolithic integrated E-mode HEMT LNA featuring 1. 5 Î¼m gate length is designed, fabricated and tested. The E-mode LNA only requires a positive voltage supply.

Additional experiments were designed to show the other unique features of the technique such as: self-CI (reagent less CI), double-resonance, use of specific reagents for chemical ionization, negative ion CI, deuterium exchange CI, and chemical ionization of samples of biological interest. ^ In FT-MS, exact mass determination rests on the abilities to measure ion resonance frequencies precisely and relate frequency to mass accurately. The mathematical relationship between mass and resonance frequency was investigated and the parameters which affect this relationship were characterized. A typical mass accuracy of 3 ppm was obtained using a parabolic mass calibration procedure. ^ A factor of two improvement in mass resolution was gained by elimination of phase distortion which results from practical ion excitation methods, and the broad skirting near the bases of peaks, inherent in magnitude mode display, was attenuated. This was accomplished using a convolution-based phase-correction technique.

Increased component durability, enhanced ability to fabricate complex-shaped components, and engine noise reduction are other potential advantages of CMC mixers (compared to metallic mixers). In 2010, NASA was pursuing the reduction of NOx emissions, fuel burn, and noise from turbine engines in Phase I of the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project. ERA subtasks, including those focused on CMC components, were formulated with the goal of maturing technology from proof of concept validation (TRL 3) to a systemsubsystem or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL 6). In April 2010, the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and LibertyWorks jointly initiated a CMC Exhaust System Validation Program within the ERA Project, teaming on CMC exhaust mixer development for subsonic jet engines capable of operating with increased performance. Our initial focus was on designing, fabricating, and characterizing the thrust and acoustic performance of a roughly quarter-scale 16 -lobe oxide oxide CMC mixer and tail cone along with a conventional low bypass exhaust nozzle. Support Services, LLC (Allendale, MI) and ATK COI Ceramics, Inc. (COIC, in San Diego, CA) supported the design of a subscale nozzle assembly that consisted of an oxide oxide CMC mixer and center body, with each component mounted on a metallic attachment ring. That design was based upon the operating conditions a mixer would experience in a turbofan engine. Validation of the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of the subscale mixer via testing and the achievement of TRL 4 encouraged the NASALWCOIC team to move to the next phase where a full scale CMC mixer sized for a RR AE 3007 engine and a compatible attachment flange were designed, followed by CMC component fabrication by COIC, and vibration testing at GRC under conditions simulating the structural and dynamic environment encountered during engine operation. AFRL (WPAFB) supported this testing by performing 3 D laser vibrometry to identify the <b>mixer</b> <b>mode</b> shapes and modal frequencies. The successful fabrication and testing of such a component has been achieved. The CMC mixer demonstrated good durability during vibration testing at room and elevated temperature (TRL 5).
