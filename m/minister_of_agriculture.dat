5|$|Although ministers are {{entitled}} to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they must consider objections and not disable themselves from exercising their discretion. In H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1969), the Housing Minister's decision was quashed because he had, by his stated policy, delegated to the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Fisheries and Food the effective decision on any appeal where the latter had an objection.|$|E
5|$|Following the ALP's {{victory in}} the 1999 general election, Bird was again {{appointed}} to the Cabinet, this time as Minister of Trade, Industry and Business Development.

5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Jagielski was {{appointed}} as a Deputy Prime Minister (thus ending {{his tenure as}} the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and becoming the Deputy of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland), and in December 1971 he became a full member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party (he was previously a deputy to an existing member). On 26 October 1971, he became the Chairman of the Planning Committee of the Council of Ministers. On 23 October 1975, he was relieved of his post as Chairman of the Planning Committee after he suffered a severe heart attack. From 1971 to 1981 he was the Polish representative in the Comecon. In February 1981 he became {{the president of the}} Economy Committee at the Council of Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian {{politician}} for the Labour Party {{best known}} for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected {{for the first time}} in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech.|$|E

5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture.</b> Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) {{was also}} called the Grand <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> and before 144 BC, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain (Zhisu neishi 治粟內史). This {{minister}} was the central government's treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He {{was in charge of}} storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and land tax, which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for units of measurement. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.|$|E
5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E

5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture,</b> was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E
5|$|Despite this decision, Bird {{returned}} to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a {{transfer to the}} Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election. In 2000, he became <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he negotiated {{an end to the}} Antiguan boycott of agricultural goods from Trinidad and Tobago. The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved in politics, and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure.|$|E

5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E
