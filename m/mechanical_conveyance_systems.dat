40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that fraud in {{relation}} to land transactions is a problem that resonates amongst land academics, practitioners, and stakeholders involved in conveyancing. As each land registration and conveyancing process increasingly moves towards a fully electronic environment, {{we need to make sure}} that we understand and guard against the frauds that can occur. What this paper does is examine the types of fraud that have occurred in paper-based <b>conveyancing</b> <b>systems</b> in Australia and considers how they might be undertaken in the National Electronic <b>Conveyancing</b> <b>System</b> (NECS) that is currently under development. Whilst no system can ever be infallible, it is suggested that by correctly imposing the responsibility for identity verification on the appropriate individual, the <b>conveyancing</b> <b>system</b> adopted can achieve the optimum level of fairness in terms of allocation of responsibility and loss. As we sit on the cusp of a new era of electronic conveyancing, the framework suggested here provides a model for minimising the risks of forged mortgages and appropriately allocating the loss. Importantly it also recognises that the electronic environment will see new opportunities for those with criminal intent to undermine the integrity of land transactions. An appreciation of this now, can see the appropriate measures put in place to minimise the risk...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} modeling framework for predicting {{the behavior of}} fibrous bulk solids in pneumatic <b>conveyance</b> <b>systems</b> that are currently not possible with conventional computational models. The developed framework allows designers to computationally predict flow characteristics of fibrous bulk solids, which impacts pneumatic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system</b> performance. These performance characteristics include air and fibrous bulk solids velocity profiles, fibrous bulk solids concentrations, pressure loss, and general system behavior. The motivation for this research is to expand the capabilities of computational models within in the engineering design process, rather than relying solely on generalized experimental correlations and previous design experience. This framework incorporates the primary characteristics of fibrous biomass-based bulk solids including low density, large characteristic length, and non-spherical shape. The main features of the developed modeling framework are (1) {{the effects of the}} particle drag on the flowing air and (2) the resistive effects of the interconnected fibers between the particles. The models are implemented within a commercially available CFD solver package with user-defined functions. Velocity profiles, bulk solids concentration, and air pressure are modeled with the differential conservation equations for mass and momentum based on the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase modeling approach. The inter-particle and the particle-air interactions result in momentum exchanges, and these exchanges are incorporated into the model through a series of externally defined user functions that account for the momentum exchange due to drag of the particles and the resistance of the connected fibers. These user-defined functions allow the user to set a series of parameters specific to the transported bulk solids and to the loading conditions. The model is applied to two specific studies, which include (1) cotton-air flow through a positive pressure pneumatic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system</b> and (2) biomass-air flow through a negative pressure (vacuum) <b>conveyance</b> <b>system.</b> The model parameters are chosen to match existing experimental data obtained from their corresponding lab tests...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for continuously monitoring, in real time and at different altitudes, airborne pollutants. In particular, by using a multi-rotor flying platform, a fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> a specific sensor and a remote transmission system for transmitting the collected data, {{it is possible to}} monitor the presence, and possibly also the concentration, of airborne pollutants along vertical transepts and/or spatial trajectories. The process is implemented by coupling single elements, appropriately built and integrated, according to a predefined sequence and by imposing a certain operational procedure. In particular, it must be pointed out that: - the multi-rotor platform has no humans aboard and is controlled remotely, although it includes an on-board automatic flight stabilization system and a system for stopping the flight in the event of failures and/or malfunctions. - the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system</b> consists of a truncated-cone element arranged in {{the upper part of the}} platform and securely anchored thereto; more in detail, the length of this element is such that it allows the monitored air to be taken partly outside the interference field of the rotors, and the flow inlet and outlet areas are so arranged as to allow the air to flow without any hindrance. - the airborne pollutant sensor is located in the upper part of the platform, at the base of the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> and its sensitive part is immersed in the outgoing flow. The platform, assembled with the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> a specific sensor and a system for remotely transmitting the collected data, is flown along vertical trajectories where stop points are imposed at different altitudes and repositioning shifts are made by means of translational movements. The vertical transepts are obtained by imposing paths that follow lines orthogonal to the ground plane and with one vertex lying therei...|$|R
