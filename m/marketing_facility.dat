40|$|This paper argues {{the case}} for {{increasing}} {{the focus on the}} "place" element of the marketing mix when marketing sport. The contention that marketing and promotional strategy decisions are largely determined by the capabilities and features of the sport facility is used to argue that "place" becomes the most important element of the marketing mix when <b>marketing</b> <b>facility</b> dependent sport services. "Place" is considered from three points of view: place as a temporal and spatial concept, place from an anthropological point of view, and, finally, place from the contemporary sport spectator's point of view. A refocused marketing mix for facility dependent sport services is presented. The refocused sport marketing mix is derived from the importance of the facility as an outlet for social interaction and, as a consequence, the use of services marketing techniques to maximise spectator enjoyment. Facility dependent sport services and those sport services not dependent on facilities are distinguished. A comparison illustrates the need for the place variable to be given a prominent position when <b>marketing</b> <b>facility</b> dependent sport services. ...|$|E

Most of the manufacturer in the surveyed area has taken farm machinery production as a seasonal business or secondary business due to seasonal demand of farm machinery. Manufacturer gets technical assistance from non-government organizations (NGOs) only. Research stations provided limited range of technical support to the manufacturer. They are not getting financial support from any kind of sources. Production problems are classified as problem before going to production, on going production problem and post-production. Before going to production manufacturer face capital, setting up infrastructure, land, skilled labour, complexity in taking bank loan, political unrest, unhealthy environment, getting electricity connection, bureaucratic complexity and technical know-how of the worker. On going production problems include capital for bulk production, skilled labour, trained technicians, load shedding, double taxation system, raw materials supply, low quality of raw material.

This study was conducted to approximation the cost of production and profitability of potato producers at Rangpur district. Data collected from 30 farmers using simple random sampling technique. The potato farmers showed individual differences in their socio-economic characteristics and absolute majority of them belonged to young age category (20 - 35 years) having medium family size, illiterate, medium farm size (0. 34 - 1. 0 acre), (1 - 10 years) farming experience. Most of the respondents used cardinal variety of potato seed and sell their output at home. Farmers who sell potato in the market were more profitable than others. The study also designates that the large farmers were most profitable compared to others.

40|$|United Kingdom local {{authority}} leisure facilities {{are beginning to}} move into a developing era of demand by the consumption of those who wish to use it due to the promotion of a healthier lifestyle. Because of this there is an increasing demand for those facilities to compete with private and not-profit organisations who have experienced and trained marketing departments to attract and publicise their products and services to the consumers out there. Therefore to stay in the market place and compete with the different sectors of the leisure provider a clearer understanding of the consumer base needs to be understood. For the effective marketing and the facility management of those leisure facilities practioners need to understand more and more about what decisions are made when the leisure consumer makes a choice of a particular leisure facility over another and in what way marketing influences this choice? Therefore this study looks at Leisure Divisions within three Local Authorities and to support this it draws upon marketing and consumer behaviour literature. The primary aim of the research was to investigate from the consumer’s perspective what external marketing variables affected their choice on a {{local authority}} leisure facility. To establish this information, data was drawn upon visitors from facilities spanning across three local authorities situated and then a qualititative analysis was conducted in form of interviews to establish what decisions were made from the leisure consumer’s perspective when making choices on a leisure facility. 80 were administered in a face to face questionnaires at each of the facilities by the researcher which were then completed by March 2007. The consumer’s abilities ranged from the recreational/ infrequent consumer through to the regular/ physically active consumer and the questionnaire contained ten questions incorporating a variety of ordinal and nominal questions as well as likert scale questions. The response rate was fairly high at 100 % (N= 80) respondents represented the sample frame a cross section of gender, age and abilities. The quantitative data was analysed via SPSS 13. 0 which is a statistical package. This revealed a variety of statistical results of approximately twenty with statistical findings (P> 0. 05) conducted then a further 5 % (N= 4) was used for a qualitative analysis.

In discussing such findings, a number of recommendations have been made as to the future management and marketing of the leisure facilities as well helping to develop this subject matter further.
