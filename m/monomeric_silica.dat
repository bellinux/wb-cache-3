50|$|Silica {{analysis}} in UPW typically includes determination of reactive and total silica. Due {{to the complexity}} of silica chemistry, the form of silica measured is defined by the photometric (colorimetric) method as molybdate-reactive silica. Those forms of silica that are molybdate-reactive include dissolved simple silicates, <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> and silicic acid, and an undetermined fraction of polymeric silica. Total silica determination in water employs high resolution ICPMS, GFAA (graphite furnace atomic absorption), and the photometric method combined with silica digestion. For many natural waters, a measurement of molybdate-reactive silica by this test method provides a close approximation of total silica, and, in practice, the colorimetric method is frequently substituted for other more time-consuming techniques. However, total silica analysis becomes more critical in UPW, where the presence of colloidal silica is expected due to silica polymerization in the ion exchange columns. Colloidal silica is considered more critical than dissolved in the electronic industry due to the bigger impact of nano-particles in water on the semiconductor manufacturing process. Sub-ppb (parts per billion) levels of silica make it equally complex for both reactive and total silica analysis, making the choice of total silica test often preferred.|$|E
40|$|Background: Soluble silica, a {{ubiquitous}} {{component of}} the diet, may be the natural ligand for dietary aluminum and may prevent its accumulation and toxicity in animals. However, previous studies on the inhibition of aluminum absorption and toxicity by soluble silica have produced conflicting results. We recently identified a soluble silica polymer, oligomeric silica, that has a much higher affinity for aluminum than does <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> {{and that may be}} involved in the sequestration of aluminum. Objective: By using 26 Al as a tracer, we investigated the effects of oligomeric and <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> on the bioavailability of alu-minum (study 1) and compared the availability of silicon from oligomeric and <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> in the human gastrointestinal tract (study 2). Design: In study 1, three healthy volunteers each ingested alu-minum alone (control), aluminum with oligomeric silica (17 mg), and aluminum with <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> (17 mg). In study 2, five healthy volunteers ingested both the oligomeric and monomeric forms of silica (34 mg). Serum and urine samples were analyzed for aluminum and silicon. Results: Oligomeric silica reduced the availability of aluminum by 67 % (P = 0. 01) compared with the control, whereas <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> had no effect (P = 0. 40). <b>Monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> was readily taken up from the gastrointestinal tract and then excreted in urine (53 %), whereas oligomeric silica was not detectably absorbed or excreted. Conclusions: The oligomeric, high-aluminum-affinity form of soluble silica reduces aluminum availability from the human gastrointestinal tract.

The deposition of amorphous silica from aqueous solution on to rutile particles has been studied {{with the aim of}} elucidating the nature of the silica-titania interactions occurring and of following the progressive build up of the silica coating. The coating process, which involves the addition of an aqueous sodium silicate solution to an aqueous dispersion of titanium dioxide, has been investigated by performing a series of controlled preparations and using the technique of microelectrophoresis. Prepared silica-coated rutile samples ranging from partial to full silica coatings have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy, microelectrophoresis and nitrogen, argon and water sorption. Nitrogen and argon adsorption isotherms have been analysed using the equation of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET). Differential energies of adsorption of nitrogen and argon have been determined calorimetrically. Water sorption isotherms have been analysed using the BET equation and the Frenkel - Halsey - Hill (FHH) equation. It has been shown that uniform silica coatings can be produced if adsorption of <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> is followed by polymerization of silica at the solid/liquid interface.

50|$|Low-temperature {{synthesis}} of clay minerals (with kaolinite as an example) has several aspects. In {{the first place}} the silicic acid to be supplied to the growing crystal must be in a <b>monomeric</b> form, i.e., <b>silica</b> should be present in very dilute solution (Caillère et al., 1957; Caillère and Hénin, 1962; Wey and Siffert, 1962; Millot, 1970). In order to prevent the formation of amorphous silica gels precipitating from supersaturated solutions without reacting with the aluminium or magnesium cations to form crystalline silicates, the silicic acid must be present in concentrations below the maximum solubility of amorphous silica. The principle behind this prerequisite {{can be found in}} structural chemistry: “Since the polysilicate ions are not of uniform size, they cannot arrange themselves along with the metal ions into a regular crystal lattice” (Iler, 1955, p. 182).|$|R
40|$|AaSTRACr: Amorphous silica phases (opal-A) {{precipitate}} innature due to {{the formation}} of dense colloids in supersaturated alkaline aqueous solutions with low relative concentrations of other ions. Opal-A dissolves and yields solutions of still relatively high silica content. In pore waters containing abundant cations, open framework polymers form which flocculate to yield opal-CT. Opal-CT becomes increasingly ordered, primarily due to preferential growth of cristobalite r lative to tridymite and crystal size increase. Opal-CT dissolves to yield pore waters of low silica concentration, which allows slow growth of quartz crystals from monomeric solution. The quartz crystals then slowly increase in size and crystallinity. Carbonates appear to enhance opal-CT formation, possibly {{due to the}} activity of positively charged hydroxyl complexes.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the overall {{behavior}} of silica {{in the presence of}} hydrolyzed Al solutions (pH range 3 - 4) is drastically modified: the total amount of dissolved silica and the initial rate at which silica passes into solution are increased compared to what is observed for a porous silica in water. By using a simple spectrophotometric approach, an estimate of the amount of <b>monomeric</b> and polymeric <b>silica</b> aqueous species can be obtained as a function of time. For all hydrolyzed solutions, the presence of a dispersed phase is also observed. Furthermore, when it is treated with these Al solutions the initial silica gel has its texture, surface charge, and global reactivity modified. This complex chain of events which occurs at acidic pH is in fact triggered by the presence in solution of highly charged Ails polymeric cations, which after adsorption onto the silica sample depolymerize in a process which involves the surface hydroxyls. This leads to the inclusion of tetrahedral Al in the silica famework and the presence of surface-coordinated octahedral Al. This globaly leads through a weakening of the Si-O bonds to an increased release of silica into solution. The Al cations left in solution interact with the aqueous Si species, leading with time to the formation of a metastable silica-aluminum dispersed phase which differs strongly from the treated silica beads. These interactions between Al hydrolyzed solutions and solid silica are therefore quite effective in spatially redistributing the initial silica beads. Many of these conclusions have been made possible by the use of solid-state NMR...|$|R
40|$|Nano-structured calcium {{silicate}} consists of randomly stacked nano-sized platelets {{that make up}} an open framework structure of macropores that resembles a house of cards. This structure affords the material the desirable physical properties of a large pore volume and a highly accessible surface area that exceed many other silicas and silicates. The material is possibly related to other disordered {{calcium silicate}} hydrates at an atomic level, although it is the macro-structure and the potential of performing chemistry upon its surface that is of great interest. Due to the novelty of nano-structured calcium silicate, little was known about it before this work. The focus of this study has therefore been placed upon characterising the material and determining the conditions that allow the pore volume and surface area to be maximised. The material is prepared through an initial precipitation from the reaction of a calcium salt with <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica,</b> followed subsequently by self-ordering on both an atomic-scale and on a macro-scale to develop the porous framework. The framework of the material has been found to collapse due to forces created from surface tension during the removal of water from the pores upon drying. The result of this collapse is a substantial reduction in both the surface area and pore volume of the material. Three different methods have been developed to maintain the structure with each modification producing a material that is suitable for different applications. A reinforcing process following the development of the open framework whereby additional silica is polymerised upon the structure strengthens the material so that the forces resulting from the removal pore water are unable to cause collapse of the framework. This material is therefore able to be repeatedly re-wet and dried without any detrimental effect to the pore volume or surface area of the material. The replacement of water within the pores with 2 -ethoxyethanol, that has a low surface tension, and by modifying the material through treatment with acid have also been found to prevent collapse of the structure. Through the knowledge gained of the development of the nano-structured calcium silicate and of the reaction conditions required for the optimisation of the surface area and pore volume, a semi-continuous process has been devised that has allowed for production of the material on a larger scale. This work also contains details on the formation of nano-structured calcium silicate by using geothermal water from an electricity generation plant as the source of <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> rather than using sodium silicate. Currently, the formation of a scale from supersaturated geothermal water is problematic for the industries that use the fluid and limits the use of the resource. The removal of <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> from geothermal water as a result of producing nanostructured calcium silicate prevents the formation of the scale and therefore allows a greater proportion of the thermal energy in the fluid to be potentially utilised...|$|E
40|$|Minimizing fouling {{caused by}} silica and {{silicate}} scales in industrial water systems using silica laden feed water continues to challenge water technologists. The solution chemistry of both silica and metal silicate systems is very complex.

40|$|Department of Urban and Environmental Engineering(Urban Infrastructure Engineering) Mechanical {{performance}} and microstructural features {{of various types}} of alkaline earth-activated slag cements were investigated as a possible alternative to OPC using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, laser diffraction, compressive strength test, conventional and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry, solid-state 27 Al and 29 Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. Calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements have been investigated as an alternative cement. However, in general, the compressive strength of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements has not been competitive with that of OPC. In this study, four different auxiliary activators which are sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, and gypsum were used with calcium hydroxide which is a major activator for GGBFS. All auxiliary activators increased early age strength at 3 days but the strength at 28 days was comparable to or even below the sample which has no auxiliary activators. The reduction of water-to-slag ratio appeared {{to be more effective}} way to improve the strength than the use of the four auxiliary activators. Microstructures of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements were highly affected by auxiliary activators where the cements produced different types of hydration products, revealed different reaction degree of slag, and formed C-S-H with different characteristics depending on the additional activators. Nevertheless, the level of compressive strength did not show big differences, which indicates that the compressive strength of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements could be determined by physical reasons such as porosity, not by chemical factors (e. g., type of hydration products, or dissolution degree of slag). Based on the results of 29 Si MAS-NMR, the substantial proportions of <b>monomeric</b> and dimeric <b>silica</b> (i. e., Q 1 and Q 2 silica) might not belong to the C-S-H, where the mean chain length of C-S-H had no relationship with the strength, which indicated that substantial portions of monomers and dimers of silica might be attributed to amorphous phases, not to C-S-H. Barium hydroxide was also used for slag activation as a main activator and the properties of barium hydroxide-activated slag cements were compared to those of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements. The strength of barium hydroxide-activated slag cements was significantly higher than that of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cement except at 3 days. The lower strength of barium hydroxide-activated slag cement at 3 days might be attributed to the lack of ettringite formation because barite (BaSO 4) was a more favorable phase than ettringite, which could play a role in producing early age strength. Nevertheless, the strength of barium hydroxide-activated slag cements was always higher than that of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cement after 3 days because the higher pH value was expected due to the higher solubility of barium hydroxide compared to calcium hydroxide and more hydration products were produced in barium hydroxide-activated slag cement than calcium hydroxide-activated slag cement. The hydration products formed in barium hydroxide-activated slag cements were barite, witherite, strätlingite, hydrotalcite-like phases, portlandite and C-S-H while those of calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements were ettringite, portlandite, and C-S-H. Although the C-S-H was formed with both barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, the characteristics of C-S-H were clearly different. The hardened matrix in calcium hydroxide-activated slag cements had Ca/Si ratios around 1. 4 while that of barium hydroxide-activated slag cements had a Ca/Si ratio below 1. 1, which was similar to the typical Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H(I). The highest dissolution degree of slag was achieved in barium hydroxide-activated slag cement due to the higher solubility of barium hydroxide, resulting in the highest amount of hydration products. Thus, the highest compressive strength and the smallest porosity were obtained in barium hydroxide-activated slag cements. Calcium oxide-activated slag cements from four different slag sources were investigated to verify the relationship between the intrinsic properties of slag and the properties of calcium oxide-activated slag cements. Despite the same mixture proportion, the strength development of calcium oxide-activated slag cements was significantly different, which indicated that the material characteristics of slag could highly influence the properties of calcium oxide-activated slag cements. However, the strength development was not governed by any single dominant material parameter of the raw slag, but rather by the combination of various favorable factors. Favorable characteristics of slag for high strength were (a) higher calcium sulfate content, (b) finer particle sizes, and (c) higher basicity and chemical modulus, while the influence of glass content was not notable. The main hydration products of calcium oxide-activated slag cements were C-S-H and portlandite as well as ettringite in cases containing calcium sulfate and various types of AFm with calcium sulfate sources. The slag which contained both calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate produced the highest compressive strength with CaO activation because of its high amount of ettringite formation. The slag collected from Dubai had the lowest strength due to the presence of bulk-sized porous calcium carbonate, indicating that, although finely ground calcium carbonate could contribute to the strength development of calcium oxide-activated slag cements, the presence of large sized calcium carbonate could be harmful to strength development because it could be a fragile point for crack initiations under loading. Finally, the influence of calcium carbonate powder on CaO-CaSO 4 -GGBFS composite cements was investigated. In this study, carbon sequestrated calcium carbonate powder was used as one of the raw materials. The compressive strength of CaO-CaSO 4 -GGBFS composite cements was increased with increasing calcium carbonate substitution up to 20 wt. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} and abundance of aluminosilicates throughout our natural surroundings, their formation at neutral pH is, surprisingly, a matter of considerable debate. From our experiments in dilute aluminum and silica containing solutions (pH ~ 7) we previously identified a silica polymer with an extraordinarily high affinity for aluminium ions (high-aluminum-affinity silica polymer, HSP). Here, further characterization shows that HSP is a colloid of approximately 2. 4 nm in diameter with a mean specific surface area of about 1, 000 m 2 g- 1 and it competes effectively with transferrin for Al(III) binding. Aluminum binding to HSP strongly inhibited its decomposition whilst the reaction rate constant {{for the formation of}} the β-silicomolybdic acid complex indicated a diameter between 3. 6 and 4. 1 nm for these aluminum-containing nanoparticles. Similarly, high resolution microscopic analysis of the air dried aluminum-containing silica colloid solution revealed 3. 9 ± 1. 3 nm sized crystalline Al-rich silica nanoparticles (ASP) with an estimated Al:Si ratio of between 2 and 3 which is close to the range of secondary aluminosilicates such as imogolite. Thus the high-aluminum-affinity silica polymer is a nanoparticle that seeds early aluminosilicate formation through highly competitive binding of Al(III) ions.

30|$|The ASP flood {{has high}} pH of 11 or above. As it {{moves through the}} reservoir, quartz silica is {{dissolved}} (Arensdorf et al. 2010) and the dissolved silica becomes stable in the high pH alkaline flood. However, the ASP flood encounters neutral pH connate water either near the wellbore or in the well as it flows to the production well. This, therefore, neutralizes the high pH alkaline water. The decreased pH of the mixed waters dramatically lowers the solubility of the <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica.</b> Besides, silicate ions complex with metal ions in the formation water pose a scale mitigation challenge. Systems with pH levels greater than 8.5 and increasing temperature may experience magnesium silicate scaling. Magnesium {{have been shown to}} aggravate the scaling tendency by complexing silica and providing the hydroxide ion in which silica precipitation is catalyzed (Demadis et al. 2007). Other metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide may also interact with silica, but these metal silicates have higher solubility than magnesium silicate (Amjad and Zuhl 2008). Furthermore, silica deposition may also be affected by the formation of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate scale does not provide nucleation sites, but it provides a matrix in which silica may be entrapped (Gill 1998). In accordance with this theory, co-precipitation and deposition of silica and silicate may also occur in this manner. The presence of both silica and magnesium creates a predicament, due to the converse solubilities of colloidal silica and magnesium silicate. Both scale species tend to form concurrently in ASP flood production systems.|$|E
40|$|Ferrihydrite is {{a common}} iron oxyhydroxide, {{produced}} both naturally and industrially. It is often found in association with silica; {{an example of this}} is its occurrence in the Paragoethite process applied in zinc hydrometallurgy for the removal of iron from acidic sulphate solutions. In this process, ferrihydrite is the primary constituent of the precipitation residue, but silica also features heavily and is believed to influence both dewatering and the adsorption of ions from solution. While some information is known regarding the physical interaction of ferrihydrite and silica when they are present as distinct phases, the process by which they simultaneously precipitate remains poorly understood. This thesis details investigations leading to a clearer understanding of this process and provides valuable insights into the factors influencing precipitate behaviour. Ferrihydrite precipitates containing varying proportions of silica were prepared via continuous crystallisation, with the aim of achieving a simplified laboratory-based simulation of the reactions that occur within plant liquors during the Paragoethite process. Multiple anionic environments including sulphate (predominant anion in the Paragoethite process), nitrate (common in natural systems) and chloride were used to monitor the influence of anions on the co-precipitation reaction. Accurate control of the slurry pH and temperature were critical to this simulation, as was maintaining steady-state solution concentrations for iron and silicate. The latter was achieved by continuous addition of iron and silicate, with the corresponding continuous removal of reaction product slurry. Analysis focused on the removed slurry using advanced structural and morphological characterisation of the solid phases formed and quantification of solution species depletion. Reaction conditions were selected to favour the formation of ferrihydrite ensuring it was the dominant phase produced. It was found that the presence of ferrihydrite increased both the rate and extent of silica removed by precipitation from solution. This phenomenon is based on surface adsorption and is hindered by the presence of ions that bind strongly with ferrihydrite. Ions such as sulphate compete with soluble silicate molecules for binding sites on the surface, whereas more weakly bound ions like nitrate do not hinder the process. The level of interference was found to be dependent on available surface area, the affinity for the ion’s adsorption and the concentration of both silicate and the ion in question. Oligomeric and colloidal silica were shown to have a significantly different influence on ferrihydrite to that of monosilicic acid. While the crystallinity of ferrihydrite was seen to decrease when precipitated in the presence of monosilicic acid, no similar effect was observed in the presence of silica in a polymeric state. Although a greater proportion of silica was removed from solution when polymerisation had already progressed to a degree, it still imposed less influence on the product crystallinity. This observation underlines the importance of the adsorption-based process that combines the materials during co-precipitation. X-ray scattering pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of the residue solids was instrumental in displaying correlations between declining ferrihydrite crystallinity and particle size. The data indicated that silicon atoms were not incorporated into the ferrihydrite crystal structure, but by inhibiting the growth of primary particles through surface adsorption, co-precipitated silica produced an apparent decrease in ferrihydrite crystallinity. The analyses presented in this thesis were combined to derive proposed mechanisms of co-precipitate formation based on both the presence of <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> and colloidal particles. When <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> (silicic acid) is present ferrihydrite particles form initially followed closely by the adsorption of silicic acid monomers which restrict further growth. The adsorbed silicic acid molecules condense across the ferrihydrite surface and polymerise outward. Particles aggregate before much, if any, silica polymerisation has occurred, and the silica continues to polymerise of the surface of the aggregates. Where oligomeric or colloidal silica is present ferrihydrite particles are produced; {{there is little or no}} immediate silica adsorption and therefore the particles grow uninhibited. During aggregation the silica particles aggregate with the ferrihydrite, being incorporated both within and on the surface of the clusters. The results of this work provide the most detailed description of the reaction mechanism in ferrihydrite/silica co-precipitation, and the most thorough analysis of the structure of co-precipitates thus far reported...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous silica {{is one of}} {{the most}} common phases to {{precipitate}} from geothermal fluids. It precipitates by self-assembly of <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> (H 4 SiO 4) via heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth of nuclei by addition of dissolved silica. The mechanism and the factors controlling the individual steps of silica precipitation have been studied in numerous laboratory experiments over the last decades and are, despite their complexity, well understood. However, due to the higher complexity of natural geothermal fluids (e. g high fluid flow rates, microbial activity or complex fluid chemistries), these findings cannot be directly applied to the study of silica scaling inside geothermal power plants and silica sinters around hot springs. In the first part of this thesis we present the results from the first ever time-resolved study of silica precipitation inside in-use geothermal pipelines. Silica scales formed primarily via heterogeneous nucleation on steel surfaces, resulting in a silica layer rapidly covering these surfaces. This pathway of silica deposition was controlled by surface roughness, total silica concentration and temperature and allowed the deposition of up to 1 g of silica per day and m 2. Homogeneous nucleation also occurred and lead to the formation of silica microspheres which were deposited preferentially into depressions and along edges or were aggregated to fan- and ridge-shaped structures growing towards the flow, depending on the fluid flow regime. While the 3 D structures could result in more turbulent flow, decreasing the flow rate, the formation of the silica layer could potentially even be beneficial for the operation of a geothermal power plant as it passivates the surface against corrosion. For the second part of this thesis, we studied the interaction of a silica solution with a protein (=lysozyme), during which hybrid composites were formed. By investigating these final products in detail, we determined that, depending on the timing of the silica-lysozyme interactions (during or after silica polymerisation) and the ratio of silica-to-protein, the resulting composites showed different structures and surface properties. This is of interest for biomineralisation as it elucidates how biomolecules interact with dissolved silica and how microorganisms can control this process. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDespite many studies, our {{understanding}} of silica precipitation from natural waters remains limited, in particular for geothermal waters. Here we present a detailed study on the kinetics of silica polymerization {{as a function of}} fluid temperature and pH using high-temperature (250 - 260 °C) seawater-derived geothermal fluids as those discharged from the Bouillante geothermal site. We monitored the on-site decrease in <b>monomeric</b> <b>silica</b> concentration(initial SiO 2 concentration of about 600 mg/l) with time using the molybdenum blue spectrophotometric method on samples of separated water collected from the high-pressure separator at 167 °C and cooled to 25, 50, 75, and 90 °C and for pH values ranging from 5 to 8. During all these experiments, only silica polymerization was observed, with the formation of colloidal particles in suspension in the solutions. No scaling of amorphous silica was formed. The collected data were after modeled {{in order to determine the}} useful kinetic parameters for predicting and preventing amorphous silica precipitation in the production wells during fluid exploitation in the specific context of Bouillante. Results under the investigated experimental conditions show that the kinetics of silica precipitation is affected more strongly by pH than by temperature change. The reaction in the acidic Bouillante solution begins with a transition period that significantly decreases the kinetics of silica polymerization. Modeling the experimental data indicates that the silica polymerization up to the state of equilibrium is characterized by a 2 nd-order kinetic law relative to dissolved silica; this could indicate that the polymerization is controlled mainly by the formation of dimers. However, the first hour of the experiments is better characterized by a 4 th-order kinetic law, suggesting more complex polymerization reactions in the initial stage with the formation of nanocolloidal particles containing 3 to 4 monomers. In both cases, the corresponding kinetics rate constant k is linearly dependent on pH for pH between 5 and 7. The activation energy Ea for the overall reaction, calculated using the Arrhenius equation under the considered pH and temperature conditions, ranges between 41 ± 9. 8 and 54 ± 9. 6 kJ/mol. To complete this work, the colloid particles formed at the end of the kinetics experiments were extracted and analyzed by SEM and TEM microscopy, X-ray Diffraction and the BET method. Results show that the size of the colloids increase and their specific surface decrease with increasing pH and are thus dependent on pH. Globally, our work provides a reliable database for understanding silica polymerization kinetics in natural geothermal brines or geologic waters characterized by a near neutral pH and moderate dissolved silica concentrations...|$|E
