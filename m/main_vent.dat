The current <b>main</b> <b>vent</b> is {{on the north side}} of the crater by the head of the Drift glacier. Also present on the mountain are Holocene lahar deposits that extend as far as the Cook Inlet.

500|$|In 1965, the {{activity}} on the main island diminished, {{but at the end}} of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6km (0.37mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the <b>main</b> <b>vent.</b> Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of [...] Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.|$|E

60|$|At 10.20 A.M. we {{had passed}} out of the {{cultivated}} region to the Montijo, or Monte Verde, the laurel-region. The 'wood' is {{the remains of a}} fine forest accidentally fired by charcoal-burners; it is now a copse of arborescent heath-worts, ilex (I. Perado), and Faya (Myrica Faya), called the 'Portugal laurel,' some growing ten feet high. We then entered upon rough ground, El Juradillo ('the Hollow'); this small edition of the Mal Pais, leading to the Canadas, is a mass of lava-beds and dry barrancos (ravines) grooved and sheeted by rushing torrents. The latter show the anatomy of the land--tufas, lavas, conglomerates, trachytes, trachydolerites, and basalts of various kinds. Most of the rocks are highly magnetic, and are separated by thin layers of humus with carbonised plant-roots. Around El Juradillo rises a scatter of montanetas, shaped like half-buried eggs: originally parasitic cones, they evidently connect with the <b>main</b> <b>vent.</b> About 1 P.M., after four hours' ride, we dismounted at the Estancia de la Sierra (6,500 feet); it is a pumice-floor a few feet broad, dotted with bush and almost surrounded by rocks that keep off a wind now blowing cold and keen. Consequently, as broken pots and bottles show, it is a favourite resting-place.|$|E
50|$|The {{wilderness}} {{is situated}} on high desert terrain and {{is associated with}} a volcanic rootless shield. This broad 10 to 12 km volcanic shield issued lava from a rootless vent.

This <b>main</b> <b>vent</b> was located near Lava Top Butte and the lava that came out of this vent travelled through the Arnold Lava Tube System to arrive at the current location of the Badlands.

50|$|The springs are {{notable for}} {{the volume of}} water {{discharged}} from the eight <b>main</b> <b>vents.</b> It is estimated that 14,000 litres of water are produced per second, approximately enough to fill 40 bathtubs.

Waters expelled from some of the smaller vents carry the sand upward.

50|$|Generally the geysers {{are known}} to erupt during the {{completion}} of the above cycle, although there have been eruptions that begin with Lower Mortar, and ever rarer: Upper Mortar. Preceding an eruption, the water levels in the whole complex will generally rise. However, the geysers may erupt at any time. The geysers' eruption will become more powerful, and the water level in the complex will rise. Splashing in the river and <b>main</b> <b>vents</b> will increase, and there may be a massive surge from the east vent triggering the eruption. All the vents in Fan will constantly jet water, with the angle vent launching water up to the boardwalk, and sometimes beyond it. Fan will show why its name is so deserved, as it erupts out of all seven vents, creating a wide fan-shaped jet that reaches heights of over 100 feet, and arcs water up over the boardwalk, landing 200 feet away from the vent. Mortar, while not as spectacular as Fan, sends jets out of its two <b>main</b> <b>vents</b> up to 50 feet high. Sometimes one vent will dominate the eruption sending a plume of water over 80 feet into the air. The eruption will generally last for around 15 minutes, until it stops, then restarts again, this time fading in power. It does this a few more times, until about 45 minutes have elapsed. It may then enter into a slight steam phase, during which the geysers send brief puffs of steam out of their vents.|$|R

Visual observations on 29 November showed ash shooting from two fractures as well as long, rapidly moving lava flows.

50|$|Devil's Garden Volcanic Field is a {{volcanic}} field located south east of Newberry Caldera in Oregon.

Several small vents to the south produced The Blowouts (two large spatter cones), several small spatter cones, and flows.

50|$|On vintage submarines, Kingston valves are fitted at {{the bottom}} of certain ballast tanks, such as safety, negative, and bow {{buoyancy}} tanks. The submarine's ballast tank valves are used to admit water when the submarine dives. The valves allow water to enter the ballast tanks, while the enclosed air escapes through the open <b>main</b> <b>vents</b> {{at the top of the}} ballast tanks. During peacetime the Kingston valves are closed when the submarine is on the surface, the valves and vents being opened to dive, but to reduce the time required for diving in wartime the Kingston valves are left permanently open when at sea, the water being kept out of the ballast tanks by the air pressure of the trapped air. This pressure is released when the vents are opened for diving, allowing the water to enter through the open Kingston valves.|$|R
