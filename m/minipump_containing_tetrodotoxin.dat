40|$|Mounting {{an immune}} {{response}} requires a relatively substantial investment {{of energy and}} marked reductions in energy availability can suppress immune function and presumably increase disease susceptibility. We have previously demonstrated that a moderate reduction in energy stores via partial surgical lipectomy (LIPx) impairs humoural immunity of Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Here we tested the hypothesis that LIPx-induced decreases in immunity are mediated by changes in the adipose tissue hormone leptin. Hamsters received bilateral surgical removal of inguinal white adipose tissue (IWATx) or sham surgeries (Sham). Half the animals in each group received osmotic <b>minipumps</b> <b>containing</b> murine leptin (0. 5  μl h− 1 for 10 days) whereas the remaining animals received <b>minipumps</b> <b>containing</b> vehicle alone; all animals were subsequently challenged with the novel antigen keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). In general, serum leptin and anti-KLH antibodies were significantly correlated with one another with higher levels generally indicating enhanced immunity. In addition, IWATx hamsters had significantly lower serum anti-KLH IgG compared with sham animals. Exogenous leptin, however, attenuated LIPx-induced immune suppression but did not affect humoural immunity in sham animals. These results suggest that reductions in energy availability lead to impairments in humoural immunity and that leptin {{can serve as a}} neuroendocrine signal between body fat and immunity regulating humoural immune responses...|$|R
5000|$|After various anthropologic {{investigations}} of [...] "zombie" [...] stories in various cultures—including Narcisse {{and a handful}} of others—reports appeared that Narcisse received a dose of a chemical mixture <b>containing</b> <b>tetrodotoxin</b> (a pufferfish toxin) and bufotoxin (a toad toxin) to induce a coma that mimicked the appearance of death.

50|$|Similar {{to other}} puffer fishes, the silver-cheeked toadfish is {{extremely}} poisonous if eaten because it <b>contains</b> <b>tetrodotoxin</b> in its ovaries {{and to a}} lesser extent its skin, muscles and liver, which protects it from voracious predators.
