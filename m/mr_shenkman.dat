50|$|Rolled Steel Products Ltd gave {{security}} {{to guarantee the}} debts of a company called SSS Ltd to British Steel Corporation. This was a purpose that did not benefit Rolled Steel Products Ltd. Moreover, Rolled Steel's director, <b>Mr</b> <b>Shenkman</b> was interested in SSS Ltd (he had personally guaranteed a debt to British Steelâ€™s subsidiary Colvilles, which SSS Ltd owed money to). The company was empowered to grant guarantees under its articles but approval of the deal was irregular because Mr Shenkman's personal interest meant his vote should not have counted for the quorum at the meeting approving the guarantee. The shareholders knew of the irregularity, and so did British Steel. Rolled Steel Products {{wanted to get out}} of the guarantee, and was arguing it was unenforceable either because it was ultra vires, or because the guarantee had been created without proper authority.|$|E
