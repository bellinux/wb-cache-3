5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake. In addition the forest shielded both sides from visual observation. Both of these factors greatly hindered the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> artillery and vehicles in the area, providing a considerable advantage to the defending forces. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights which were some 150 metres higher than the surrounding flat terrain, which {{were some of the}} few dry and clear areas, and in addition provided good observation. Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire. The Neva River and marshes were partially frozen in winter which allowed infantry to cross it, but not heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> serpins {{provides a}} key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors.

The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} closed form {{solution}} for the vibration response of finite ribbed plates to point force/moment excitations is presented in this paper. This solution shows that input <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> finite ribbed plates are bounded by the input <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> the uncoupled plate and beam that form the ribbed plate. It is found that point force input <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> a finite ribbed plate are controlled by the plate bending stiffness when the excitation force {{is more than a}} quarter wavelength away from the beam. The input mobilities are mainly dominated by the beam flexural stiffness when the force acts on or very close to the beam, and when the beam flexural stiffness is far greater than the plate bending stiffness. Similar result is found in the moment excitation case when the moment axis is perpendicular to the beam neutral axis (bending moment excitation). In contrast, the input <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> the ribbed plate do not vary much from that of the corresponding uncoupled plate when the moment axis parallels to the beam’s neutral axis (torsional moment excitation) where the input mobilities are mainly dominated by the plate bending stiffness. The reductions in plate kinetic energy due to beam insertions are discussed...|$|R
