40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of magnetization {{has been determined}} for sputter-deposited Fe-Cr-N films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Decomposition and phase transformation with heating have been determined by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermomagnetometry. There are three <b>magnetic</b> <b>transformation</b> stages in the temperature-rising thermomagnetic curves. The first stage which occurs below 350 degrees C corresponds to the paramagnetic transition of the ferromagnetic alpha-Fe-Cr phase. The second stage (350 - 550 degrees C) is the decomposition of the alpha-Fe-Cr and nonmagnetic gamma'-(Fe,Cr) (4) N-x phases into the pure alpha-Fe and sigma-FeCr phases, leading to an increase of the magnetization and {{the disappearance of the}} perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The final <b>magnetic</b> <b>transformation</b> stage is the paramagnetic transition (T-c= 735 degrees C) of the pure alpha-Fe phase. Since there is no rapid magnetization change between liquid helium temperature and room temperature, the gamma'-(Fe,Cr) (4) N-x phase is nonmagnetic at low temperatures. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.

The effect of the different thermal treatments on the <b>magnetic</b> and structural <b>transformation</b> temperatures, {{as well as on}} the thermodynamics of the martensitic transformation, has been made by calorimetric measurements. The evolution of the degree of long-range atomic order with temperature has been determined by neutron diffraction experiments, thus confirming the effect of thermal treatments on the atomic order. Calorimetric and structural results allow thermal treatments to be directly related to atomic order, and to allow the effect of the atomic order on the martensitic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>transformations</b> in Ni-Mn-In alloys to be quantified.

The {{study has been}} completed with {{the evaluation of the}} magnetic fabric after laboratory application of sequential heating experiments. The present study shows that: (1) close to Foum Zguid dykes, the variations of the bulk magnetic parameters and of the magnetic fabric is strongly related with re-crystallization and Fe-metasomatism intensity. (2) The thermal experiments on AMS of samples collected farther from the dyke and, thus, less affected by heating during dyke emplacement, indicate that 300 – 400 °C is the minimum experimental temperature necessary to trigger appreciable transformations of the pre-existing magnetic fabrics. For temperatures higher than ca. 580 °C, the <b>magnetic</b> fabric <b>transformations</b> are fully realized, with complete transposition of the initial fabric to a fabric similar to that of samples collected close to the dyke. Therefore, measured variations of the magnetic fabric can be used to evaluate re-crystallization temperatures experienced by the host sedimentary rock during dyke emplacement. The distinct magnetic behaviour observed along the cross-sections strongly suggests that samples collected farther from the dyke margins did not experience thermal episodes with temperatures higher than 300 °C after dyke emplacement. (3) AMS data shows a gradual variation of the magnetic fabric with distance from the dyke margin, from sub-horizontal K 3 away from the dyke to vertical K 3 close to the dyke.

A strong dependence of Curie temperature on pressure, dTC∕dP=+ 4. 8 K∕kbar, is observed {{in contrast with the}} smaller values of about 3 K∕kbar found in polycrystalline specimens. This difference reflects the role the microstructure may play in pressure-induced magnetic-crystallographic phase changes, likely related to stress relaxation at the grain boundaries, domain pinning and/or nucleation of defects. The pressure dependence of the critical magnetic field, d(dHC∕dT) ∕dP, drops at the rate − 0. 122 (5) kOe∕K kbar, which points to an enhancement of the magnetoelastic coupling with pressure. The latter affects the magnetocaloric behavior of the material at the rate d(ΔSM) ∕dP≅ 1. 8 J∕kg K kbar.
