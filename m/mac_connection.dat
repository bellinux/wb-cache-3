30|$|Each {{of these}} MAC sub-layers are defined with its {{respective}} characteristics. The MAC CS layer {{is the main}} function to classify and maps external network data through the CS Service Access Point (SAP) and converts these data into the MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) for transmission over the air. The CS layer specifies {{the two types of}} traffic which are transported. They are Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Internet Protocol (IP) packets. Each of which is identified with a Connection Identifier (CID) [10]. On the other sub layers, the MAC CPS layer is {{the main part of the}} MAC layer which defines the medium access method and specifies the functionality of the system access, bandwidth allocation, scheduling, contention mechanism, connection establishment, and connection maintenance [9]. It receives data from various CSs through the MAC SAP, which is classified to a particular <b>MAC</b> <b>connection</b> [6]. The MAC Security sub-layer lies between the PHY layer and the MAC CPS. The Security sub-layer deals with security issues, authentication and key management. The PHY and MAC layers have constantly received attention and are gradually redesigned to address newly emerging technologies and needs.|$|E

We propose an effective clustering algorithm based on a random contention model without the prior knowledge of the network and the ID's of nodes.

40|$|Abstract—IEEE 802. 16 is {{a recent}} IEEE {{standard}} for broadband wireless access networks. In IEEE 802. 16 networks, the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is centralized and explicitly supports quality of service (QoS). That is to say, access to the medium {{by a number of}} Subscriber Stations (SSs) is centrally controlled by one Base Station (BS), which is responsible for allocating bandwidth to several <b>MAC</b> <b>connections</b> in order to provide them with the negotiated QoS guarantees. However, although the network can be operated in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode (that is, transmissions from the BS (downlink) and SSs (uplink) occur on separate frequency channels), the standard supports SSs with half-duplex capabilities. This means that they are equipped with a single radio transceiver which can be used either to transmit in the uplink direction or to receive in the downlink direction. This may severely hamper the capacity to support QoS. Therefore, in order to allocate bandwidth, an IEEE 802. 16 BS has to solve two related issues: 1) how it can schedule bandwidth grants to SSs {{in order to meet the}} QoS requirements of their connections and 2) how it can coordinate the uplink and downlink scheduled grants so as to support half-duplex capabilities. In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for a set of scheduled grants to be allocated so that the transmission of each half-duplex SS does not overlap with its reception. Based on this, we propose a grant allocation algorithm, namely, the Half-Duplex Allocation (HDA) algorithm, which always produces a feasible grant allocation provided that the sufficient conditions are met. HDA has a computation complexity of OðnÞ, where n is the number of grants to be allocated. Finally, we show that the definition of HDA allows us to address the two issues mentioned above by following a pipeline approach. This is when scheduling and allocation are implemented by separate and independently running algorithms, which are jus...|$|R

40|$|This works aims at {{evaluating}} achievable {{performance for}} TCP/IP data transfer over DECT radio interface, by verifying {{the ability of}} DECT lower layers protocols, namely DLC and MAC, to mask the radio interface unreliability and to provide flexible transfer means for TCP data. Major points are: (i) the interplay of error recovery mechanisms at the various layers; (ii) the effectiveness of providing multibearer capabilities (i. e. allowing slot bundling in the radio access); (iii) the possible gains brought about by <b>MAC</b> asymmetric <b>connections</b> in view of essentially asymmetric TCP data flows Obtained results indicate that satisfactory performance can be obtained, since the lower layers recovery functions are able to mask even a rather pessimistic radio channel behavior as here assumed. This comes {{at the price of}} about half of the gross available capacity, because of static overhead and radio channel impairments, which is anyway in the order of (often less than) typical overhead due to radio communication protecting codes, e. g., a defined in GSM, UMTS, CDPD...|$|R

40|$|Mobile and {{wireless}} communication systems {{are becoming more}} and more complex, making understanding the interaction of different technologies on different layers a very difficult task. The introduction of sophisticated techniques on the physical layer that react to changes of the wireless channel on small timescales requires new paradigms for modeling, simulating, and analyzing current and future wireless networks. Investigating the relationship of new physical layer techniques, application-specific requirements and performance measures will become a major research topic for future wireless networks. A continuous change in the methodology for evaluating the network performance takes place in the Internet. In the past, network performance was mainly evaluated using concretely measurable values like packet loss rate, delay, or jitter. The current trend in the Internet goes toward application-specific quality measures that judge more the subjective experience of the end user than they do network parameters. In the terminology, this is expressed as the change from quality of service (QoS-Quality of Service (QoS)) to quality of experience (QoE). For wireless networks this leads to interesting consequences, as currently the traffic requirements for <b>MAC</b> layer <b>connections</b> are mainly formulated in terms of QoS parameters. Accomplishing the change from QoS to QoE also in the definition of connection parameters is a future challenge for wireless networks, for which the first approaches are presented...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} for {{broadband wireless access}} was recently approved. It defines a physical layer for systems operating at frequency bands between 10 and 66 GHz, a medium access control (MAC) protocol and the convergence layers for carrying protocols such as IP, ATM and Ethernet. An IEEE 802. 16 system consists of a base station and one or more subscriber stations. The duplexing scheme is either TDD or FDD. In the FDD case there is seamless support of half-duplex subscriber stations. The transmissions in the downlink direction are done in a TDM fashion, {{with the possibility of}} introducing re-synchronization preambles to improve the statistical multiplexing in a deployment with half-duplex FDD terminals. The uplink operates in a TDMA fashion. Adaptive modulation is employed both in the uplink and the downlink. The <b>MAC</b> protocol is <b>connection</b> oriented and is capable of providing QoS. The MAC protocol utilizes variable length PDUs and is thus optimized to carry connectionless traffic such as IP and Ethernet while not sacrificing efficiency when carrying ATM.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of verifiable {{computation}} (VC) in which a computationally weak client wishes to delegate the computation of a function f on an input x to a computationally strong but untrusted server. We present new general approaches for constructing VC proto-cols, as well as solving the related problems of program checking and self-correcting. The new approaches reduce the task of verifiable com-putation to suitable variants of secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols. In particular, we show how to efficiently convert the secrecy property of MPC protocols into soundness of a VC protocol via {{the use of a}} message authentication code (<b>MAC).</b> The new <b>connections</b> allow us to apply results from the area of MPC towards simplifying, unifying, and improving over previous results on VC and related problems. In particular, we obtain the following concrete applications: (1) The first VC protocols for arithmetic computations which only make a black-box use of the underlying field or ring; (2) a non-interactive VC protocol for boolean circuits in the preprocessing model, conceptually simplify-ing and improving the online complexity of a recent protocol of Gen-naro et al. (Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2009 / 547); (3) NC 0 self-correctors for complete languages in the complexity class NC 1 and var-ious log-space classes, strengthening previous AC 0 correctors of Gold-wasser et al.

5000|$|Hawkes is a {{sympathetic}} soul {{who is willing}} to lend an ear to anyone who needs to talk. During [...] "Murder Sings the Blues" [...] (episode 307) he is shown in flashback to have met a girl at a party. The girl felt unhappy, so Hawkes took her out {{for a cup of coffee}} and listened to her tell him her troubles. Afterwards, he gave her his phone number if she ever felt like she needed to talk to him again. The girl is found dead two weeks later on board a subway car following a rave party, with Hawkes' phone number still on her person. Hawkes, when he discovers his phone number in the girl's possession, neglects to tell <b>Mac</b> about his <b>connection</b> to her, which earns him a dressing-down from Mac in front of the entire lab. Later, Hawkes apologizes to Mac for not disclosing how he knew the victim and tells his story. Their relationship has clearly mended by episode 309 ("And Here's To You, Mrs Azrael"), when Mac confides about his father's lingering death from cancer, and Sheldon comforts him. This dialogue also indicates that Hawkes is opposed to euthanasia. On a few episodes, such as [...] "Hammer Down", [...] "It Happened To Me", and [...] "Scared Stiff", Dr. Hawkes tends to get emotional when a murder is medical-related, or if the suspect happens to be a doctor. Hawkes has been the victim of racism while out in the field especially in dealings with white supremacist Micheal Elgers. In [...] "Green Piece", Hawkes investigating the bombing of a house, is led to Elgers who is adorned with Nazi tattoos all over his body and other white power propaganda is discovered in Elgers' apartment. Elgers lays into Hawkes calling him inferior, an affirmative action case, but Hawkes stands his ground. In [...] "Yahrzeit", Hawkes is faced with the death of his uncle and plans to fly to Michigan for the funeral, however the flight is delayed and Hawkes decides to help the team investigate the murder of an auctioneer. He offers to assist Danny Messer with Messer informing his friend that he's about to question Micheal Elgers. Hawkes defiantly states, [...] "He's a vicious racist and that's his problem". Elgers once again targets Hawkes for being black, but like before, Hawkes maintains composure. Hawkes remains in New York long enough to see Elgers arrested for crimes unrelated to the murder before taking his flight to be with his family to honor his uncle.|$|R
