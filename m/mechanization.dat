5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. <b>Mechanization</b> will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to <b>mechanization</b> the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Heavy Draft was {{originally}} bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture, urban settings, and military capacities, {{as well as}} for the production of large mules for the military. The breed's docility, size, strength, and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of <b>mechanization.</b> It is still used for farming in a few areas where <b>mechanization</b> is impractical. The mares are also still used for the production of mules, although most horses today are bred for meat. Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006. Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of <b>mechanization</b> {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, <b>mechanization,</b> four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution.

50|$|Nuffield <b>Mechanizations</b> Limited was {{incorporated}} in the mid-1930s, probably as Wolseley Aero Engines Limited. Wolseley had begun aero engine development in 1929 but when Wolseley Motors became a subsidiary of Morris Motors Limited on 1 July 1935 it had been decided to keep aero engine development quite separate.

5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but <b>mechanization,</b> combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. <b>Mechanization</b> and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although <b>mechanization</b> has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E

Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. <b>Mechanization</b> and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing <b>mechanization</b> and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{continued}} through World War II, {{and the horses}} were used heavily during Norway's occupation by Germany. Breed numbers and interest diminished after the war as increasing <b>mechanization</b> reduced demand for draft animals; however, a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers. In 1947, the National DÃ¸lehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed. As of 2002, there are approximately 4,000 registered Dole Gudbrandsdals, with around 175 new foals registered annually.|$|E

5|$|Modern-day Olympic equestrian {{events are}} rooted in cavalry skills and {{classical}} horsemanship, and through 1948, competition was restricted to active-duty officers on military horses. Only after 1952, as <b>mechanization</b> of warfare {{reduced the number of}} military riders, were civilian riders allowed to compete. Equestrian is the only Olympic sport in which animals compete with humans, and is one of four sports in which the genders compete against each other, the others being some sailing divisions, mixed doubles division in tennis and the mixed doubles division of badminton. The rules for Olympic equestrian competition are set by the FÃ©dÃ©ration Ãquestre Internationale, the international governing body for equestrian sports.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by <b>mechanization,</b> and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The Auxois is {{a direct}} {{descendant}} of the Bourguignon of the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, blood was added from other French draft breeds before {{the creation of a}} stud book in 1912.

World War I interrupted efforts to set the breed standard, but testing resumed in 1920, and between then and World War II the Auxois was the pride of regional farmers. The breed reached its peak in the 1930s, but by the 1960s began to decline with the advent of <b>mechanization.</b>|$|E
