5|$|The priory {{may also}} have owned a cell at Scarth Wood at Whorlton. A grant issued by Stephen de Meynell in the reign of Henry I records the {{donation}} of the hamlet of Scarth to enable the priory to establish a cell for habitation by a single monk or canon. It is unclear whether the cell was built as Scarth is {{not mentioned in the}} priory's deeds or in Henry VIII's commissioners' valuation of its property. Fragmentary building remains at Scarth are recorded as existing in the mid-18th century. They were cleared by the start of the 19th century so there is no trace of whatever <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> stood there or indication of what it might have been used for.|$|E
25|$|There are now {{bakeries}} in {{the larger}} cities. The most popular loaves are soft, white, and bland. There are also local soft drink bottlers, who make various local varieties of soda. A Tongan who <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> breakfasted on bits of cooked pork and yam from a hanging basket may now have white bread and soda for breakfast.|$|E
25|$|Excavations in 2003 and in 2014 made it {{very likely}} that this {{structure}} {{as well as the}} neighbouring one S10 were originally royal tombs. At the latter date, during excavations directed by Josef W. Wegner of the University of Pennsylvania, a fragment of a funerary tomb stela bearing a relief naming a king Sobek was found inside the enclosure of tomb S10, on {{the eastern side of the}} complex, where a funerary temple <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> existed. In addition, fragments of wooden coffin inscribed for the same Sobekhotep were uncovered in later Second Intermediate Period tombs adjacent to S10. These fragments indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10.|$|E

60|$|The {{capture of}} the fortress, and {{subsequently}} of Limberg, was all the campaign of 1703 effected; whereas, had the English commander been allowed to have his way, the great results which were not obtained until after three years' further fighting <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been gained.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>once</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been, <b>once</b> only: [...] We {{lodged in}} a street together, You, a sparrow on the housetop lonely, [...] I, a lone she-bird of his feather.|$|R
500|$|The Greek {{historian}} Strabo (ca 63 BC–AD 24) {{described the}} mountain in Book V, Chapter 4 of his Geographica as having a predominantly flat, barren summit covered with sooty, ash-coloured rocks and suggested that it <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> had [...] "craters of fire". He also perceptively suggested that the fertility of the surrounding slopes {{may be due to}} volcanic activity, as at Mount Etna.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{have speculated}} on {{possible}} reasons for two different years of birth to {{have appeared in}} historical documents. If 1755 is correct, Hamilton might {{have been trying to}} appear younger than his college classmates, or perhaps wished to avoid standing out as older. If 1757 is correct, the single probate document indicating a birth year of 1755 may have simply included an error, or Hamilton <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> given his age as 13 after his mother's death in an attempt to appear older and more employable. Historians have pointed out that the probate document contained other proven inaccuracies that demonstrated that it was not entirely reliable, and Richard Brookhiser noted that [...] "a man is more likely to know his own birthday than a probate court." ...|$|E
500|$|Capel Lligwy {{is built}} from rubble masonry; at about [...] up the walls, the style changes and smaller stones are {{inserted}} into {{spaces between the}} larger blocks, showing where the 14th-century rebuilding started. The doorway is on the south side, headed by a plain arch, and dates from the 12thcentury. [...] There is a stone bellcote at the west end. [...] There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation would have sat) and the chancel (where the altar would have been located). There are no window openings on the north side, {{but there is a}} blocked opening to the east (about [...] wide) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall. There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel. [...] The vault, which is about , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel. Limestone slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above. A stone in the nave, about [...] with a hole in the top, <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been used as a churchyard cross.|$|E
5000|$|The rings that Flo {{says she}} feels [...] "may be {{imagined}} {{a symbol of}} the frustrated hopes of youth, of marriages that never occurred failed or equally their eternal union" [...] that has kept them together throughout their personal tragedies. Or, perhaps, these women meet/exist outside of time and whatever rings they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> worn <b>have</b> disappeared along the way.|$|R
60|$|The {{little woman}} grinned as she asked this question, and Archie, had he at all {{understood}} her character, <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> put {{himself on a}} pleasant footing with her; {{but he was still}} confused and ill at ease, and only muttered something about the truth of his love for Julia.|$|R
60|$|She didn't know, {{what any}} {{psychologist}} <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> told her, {{that no one}} with the fatal taint of madness in her blood could ever even have thought of that righteous self-denial. Such scruples {{have no place in}} the selfish insane temperament; they belong only to the highest and purest types of moral nature.|$|R
500|$|In {{south-east}} Essex, Murrell {{was known}} as [...] "The Devil's Master", a title that he himself used as a self-description. He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life, speaking seldom, and traveling largely at night. His house was locally known as a [...] "place to avoid" [...] and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside, plucking {{up the courage to}} enter. Within the cottage, Murrell had drying herbs hanging from his ceiling, and his devices were reported to include a crystal, a mirror, and a bowl of water. Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were [...] a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not, and a [...] "trick" [...] telescope that supposedly enabled him [...] "to see through brick walls". The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell's, who deemed it to be [...] "a clumsily home-made arrangement of bits of looking-glass, such as <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been bought at a toy-shop". Murrell possessed a library of books, including works on astrology and astronomy, conjuration, and medical texts. He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics, the last of which survived into at least the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|It {{also does}} not mean that a {{commercial}} bank's overnight reserves can become negative, in these countries. The central bank will always step in to lend the necessary reserves if necessary so that this does not happen; this is sometimes described as [...] "defending the payment system". Historically a central bank <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> run out of reserves to lend and so have had to suspend redemptions, but this can no longer happen to modern central banks because {{of the end of the}} gold standard worldwide, which means that all nations use a fiat currency.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the tomb and until 2015, it was unknown who was buried here. Excavations in 2003 and in 2014 made it very likely that the structure was once a royal tomb. At the latter date, during the excavation directed by Josef W. Wegner of the University of Pennsylvania, a fragment of a funerary tomb stela bearing a relief naming a king Sobek was found inside the enclosure, on {{the eastern side of the}} complex, close to where a small funerary chapel <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> existed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I--I understand," [...] said Lord Keith, [...] "that you {{had most}} honourably, most consistently, made him aware that--that what <b>once</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{desirable}} has unhappily become impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir," [...] {{cried the}} lady, with great vivacity {{and with more}} cheerful accents--as though her mind had been {{relieved}} of a burden of fear that her companion <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> declined even a consideration of her request--"indeed, sir, {{you will find that}} the trust which I would impose upon you is in appearance no such great matter as my words may have led you to suppose.|$|R
2500|$|The {{use of the}} hyphen in English {{compound}} nouns and verbs has, in general, {{been steadily}} declining. Compounds that <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary removed the hyphens from 16,000entries, such as fig-leaf (now fig leaf), pot-belly (now pot belly) and pigeon-hole (now pigeonhole). [...] The increasing prevalence of computer technology {{and the advent of}} the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past [...] (e.g. [...] "toolbar", [...] "hyperlink", [...] "pastebin").|$|E
60|$|The {{buildings}} {{consisted of}} the cottage itself, the wood-shed, a second shed which <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> {{been used as a}} carriage-house, and a small barn or stable.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Harry, no; {{you shall}} take your young, fresh, generous heart {{to a better}} market than that; not but that the distressed damsel will ever {{remember}} what <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Sarsuti is a corruption of the word Sarasvati and that the 6-8 km wide channel of the Sarsuti-Ghaggar system <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been the Sarasvati River mentioned in the Rig Veda.|$|R
5000|$|Tír-na Nog'th {{appears in}} Roger Zelazny's [...] "Chronicles of Amber". The city appears during full moon {{above the city}} of Amber. The only {{inhabitants}} of this city are shadows and ghosts of people who <b>once,</b> <b>might</b> <b>have,</b> or never existed.|$|R
50|$|Fishing, <b>once,</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a {{profitable}} venture. The two pandakashalas, built {{close to the}} seashore, one near the Church and the other at Njaramugham, for processing and storing fish, have disappeared, but their remains account for the then flourishing fish trade.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{never heard}} your name, and never saw you before. Strange! very strange! Ah! I {{remember}} somebody--only an old woman, sir--who <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> explained it. Where shall I find the like of her now?" ...|$|E
60|$|The lawn, {{although}} neglected, {{was still}} as level as a bowling-green--which indeed it <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> served for; and the {{blades of grass}} before the window were raked by the candle-shine, which stretched over them {{so far as to}} touch the yeoman's face in front.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dorcas had arrayed her in some plain {{garments}} which <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> {{belonged to}} herself or her sisters, {{and the little}} maid was so well content with this new friend that she had but curt greetings for the boy who considered himself her guardian.|$|E
60|$|Vincent {{directed}} his course so that, while the boat's head was still pointing up the stream, {{and she was}} apparently moving {{in the same direction}} as the ships, she was gradually getting out to the middle of the river. Had he tried to row straight across, suspicion <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been excited. In half an hour they were in the middle of the stream. A vessel passing under full sail swept along at a distance of a hundred yards, and they were hailed. Vincent merely waved his hand and continued his course.|$|R
50|$|While it is {{not known}} how many people {{inhabited}} Kahoʻolawe, the lack of freshwater probably limited the population to a few hundred people. As many as 120 people <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> lived at Hakioawa, the largest settlement, which was located at the northeastern end of the island—facing Maui.|$|R
60|$|The fear I {{felt was}} no {{rational}} fear, but a panic terror {{not only of}} the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently as a child <b>might</b> do. <b>Once</b> I <b>had</b> turned, I did not dare to look back.|$|R
6000|$|The woman--the dumb woman, {{with the}} stony {{face and the}} horrid eyes--reappeared in his thoughts, and {{got in the way}} of his decision. Pooh! some crazed old servant, who <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been cook; who was kept out of charity now. Nothing more {{important}} than that. No more of her! no more of her! ...|$|E
60|$|The piano {{was indeed}} hopelessly out of order, but Mottram managed {{to bring the}} rebellious notes {{into a sort of}} agreement, and there rose from the ragged {{keyboard}} something that <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been the ghost of a popular music-hall song. The men in the long chairs turned with evident interest as Mottram banged the more lustily.|$|E
6000|$|... "She eats human flesh?" [...] I asked. Not in horror, however, for {{since my}} {{recently}} acquired {{knowledge of the}} Holy Therns I was prepared for anything in this still less accessible heaven, where all was evidently dictated by a single omnipotence; where ages of narrow fanaticism and self-worship had eradicated all the broader humanitarian instincts that the race <b>might</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> possessed.|$|E
5000|$|James Haweis {{makes the}} point that {{although}} the Blücher kept the three corps which he was to lead to Paris within half a day's ordinary march of each other, the Anglo-allied army and the Prussians were separated by more than a day and that: the reason for the comparative slowness of Wellington's advance compared with Blucher's is not evident. Had the Napoleon of 1814 commanded the army at Soissons on the 26th, he <b>might</b> <b>once</b> more <b>have</b> delivered against the extended and unsupported Prussians the lightning-like strokes which then paralysed his enemies, though success, as in the former campaign, could only have retarded, not averted, the final disaster.|$|R
60|$|Possibly, the Judge {{was aware}} how little true hardihood lay behind Hepzibah's {{formidable}} front. At any rate, being a gentleman of steady nerves, he soon recovered himself, and failed not to approach his cousin with outstretched hand; adopting the sensible precaution, however, {{to cover his}} advance with a smile, so broad and sultry, that, had it been only half as warm as it looked, a trellis of grapes <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> turned purple under its summer-like exposure. It may have been his purpose, indeed, to melt poor Hepzibah on the spot, {{as if she were}} a figure of yellow wax.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of nothing else all the night, Mr. Henderson. I put myself in Julian's position, {{and it seemed to}} me that, hearing a gun fired so close at hand, even if he did not hear a cry, Julian knowing how often the man had been threatened, <b>might</b> at <b>once</b> <b>have</b> run to the spot, and might have behaved just as Faulkner says he did. All that seemed to me simple enough; Julian's absence was the only difficulty, and the only way I could possibly account for it, was that he had followed the murderer." ...|$|R
