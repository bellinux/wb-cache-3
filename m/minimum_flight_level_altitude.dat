5000|$|The {{probable}} {{cause of the}} crash was determined to be: [...] "The instrument flight training manuals show that the Linea Aeropostal Venezolana has approved a procedure for entering Maiquetia in semi-IFR conditions. This procedure consists in maintaining a <b>minimum</b> <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> of 10000ft {{as far as the}} station (Miq 292.5), then turning north over this pount and continuing on a 360deg heading for 4 minutes followed by a standard let-down to 1200ft above sea level until contact is established, and a return to the aerodrome under VFR. It is obvious that the pilot-in-command did not fully comply with this procedure, and, after accumulating errors in estimating his speed, endeavoured to make a direct approach which proved fatal because his altitude {{at the time of his}} last report was insufficient to cross the Avila mountain range against which the impact occurred." ...|$|R
50|$|Aircraft altitudes for {{air traffic}} control and related {{purposes}} are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, {{most of the world}} has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many CIS (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> (<b>Flight</b> <b>Level</b> 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> at high <b>altitude</b> to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.|$|R
50|$|Flight {{planning}} requires accurate weather forecasts so {{that fuel}} consumption calculations {{can account for}} the fuel consumption effects of head or tail winds and air temperature. Safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the planned destination becomes unavailable. Furthermore, {{under the supervision of}} air traffic control, aircraft flying in controlled airspace must follow predetermined routes known as airways, even if such routes are not as economical as a more direct flight. Within these airways, aircraft must maintain <b>flight</b> <b>levels,</b> specified <b>altitudes</b> usually separated vertically by 1000 or 2000 feet (305 or 610 m), depending on the route being flown and the direction of travel. When aircraft with only two engines are flying long distances across oceans, deserts, or other areas with no airports, they have to satisfy additional ETOPS safety rules to ensure they can reach some emergency airport if one engine fails.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} SSR {{is to improve}} the ability to detect and {{identify}} aircraft while automatically providing the <b>Flight</b> <b>Level</b> (pressure <b>altitude)</b> of an aircraft. An SSR ground station transmits interrogation pulses on 1030 MHz (continuously in Modes A, C and selectively, in Mode S) as its antenna rotates, or is electronically scanned, in space. An aircraft transponder within line-of-sight range 'listens' for the SSR interrogation signal and transmits a reply on 1090 MHz that provides aircraft information. The reply sent depends on the interrogation mode. The aircraft is displayed as a tagged icon on the controller's radar screen at the measured bearing and range. An aircraft without an operating transponder still may be observed by primary radar, but would be displayed to the controller without the benefit of SSR derived data. It is typically a requirement to have a working transponder in order to fly in controlled air space and many aircraft have a back-up transponder to ensure that condition is met.|$|R

30|$|The {{students}} were poor at scanning the scene during most {{components of the}} cardiac arrest and may lack the use of “peripheral vision” and constant visual scanning {{due to a lack}} of experience. Kirby et al. found in a study of military helicopter pilots undertaking a high speed low <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> task that the more experience pilots covered more in the scanning of the instruments in less time, maintained a <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> and spent less time looking outside for a long time compare to the novice pilots (Kirby et al. 2014). The issue may be that student paramedics are not completely familiar with managing a cardiac arrest scene so spend more time focusing on the defibrillator and concentrating on the tasks they need to perform and do not think about a constant visual “sweep” of the scene to ascertain what is happening, especially from a safety perspective.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 23 - 26, 2000 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA recent Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{initiative}} {{has reduced}} certain oceanic routes from a 2, 000 -foot {{vertical separation minimum}} to a 1, 000 -foot (300 m) separation <b>minimum</b> between <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> of 29, 000 feet and 41, 000 feet.

The aging military airframes are not currently Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) certified. The impact on military deployment time to foreign theatres as well as high- fuel cost makes this a high-priority DoD issue. This paper describes the test and evaluation (T&E) challenge, viable solutions and test method for meeting the RVSM requirements in an approved, affordable, and least down-time (minimal aircraft modification) manner. The test method described herein utilizes a PACER aircraft in formation with the RVSM candidate aircraft. The RVSM {{is just one of the}} many Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) requirements which must be met for military aircraft to fly within premium airspace during overseas deployment. The commercial equivalent of GATM is Communications Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM).
