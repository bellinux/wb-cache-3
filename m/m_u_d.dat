40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of the fluvial history and stratigraphy of Quaternary deposits in semi-arid central Australia is at present poorly understood. This thesis presents a detailed study of the Quaternary fluvial and aeolian deposits in the Cooper Creek floodplain of southwest Queensland. The present Cooper floodplain is very low gradient (0. 00015) and consists several metres of near surface muds characterised by abundant shallow surficial braid-like and reticulate channels, and less common but widespread deeper and narrower anastomosing channels, some with sandy beds. These deeper channels often interconnect much larger waterholes, {{some of which have}} scoured beneath the <b>m</b> <b>u</b> <b>d</b> into an extensive underlying sand sheet which was deposited primarily by laterally migrating rivers during the middle to late Quaternary. Extensive subsurface excavations revealed evidence of lateral accretionary surfaces, point bar development and upward-fining sequences. In a very few locations, the planform of these meandering channels is still visible within the muds of the present floodplain surface. Floodplain muds were deposited 35 m. The TL (thermoluminescence) evidence indicates that the fluvial sand-regime dominated oxygen isotope Stages 5 - 7 with a maximum recorded TL date in this study of 3 ̆e 700 ka at a depth of 27 m and represents the oldest TL dated fluvial deposit in Australia. The peak of fluvial sand activity is - 100 ka, while <b>m</b> <b>u</b> <b>d</b> transport dominated during Stage 1 and 3 pluvials. Good agreement exists between the fluvial TL dates and worldwide interglacials (Stages 1, 3, 5 and 7). However, there is also a strong fluvial signature evident during the glacial Stage 6 (186 - 127 ka). During the transitional phases between sand and mud-load regimes, source bordering dunes were developed: the remnants of which appear at the surface of the contemporary Cooper Creek floodplain. Interestingly, the bulk of the dune TL dates range between Stages 3 and 1 with a pronounced phase of activity evident during the pluvial Stage 3, whilst very few dune dates appear in Stage 2. The role of source-bordering dunes is an important factor influencing channel morphology of the anastomosing channels. A model of channel development is presented using evidence from rare but recent evidence of channel change. Climatic change during the mid to late-Quaternary is proposed as the major factor influencing the palaeohydrology and sediment transport of Cooper Creek, however, the role of neotectonic events cannot be discounted...|$|E

Usando como metodología la investigación bibliográfica, retoma el pensamiento de Novak y de Alberto Cañas, del cual se deriva que los Mapas Conceptuales, son una poderosa herramienta e instrumento, para la modelación rápida y precisa de simples y complejas relaciones causales-jerárquicas y cognitivas.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{proposal}} that the “hybrid bison ” of Wood Buffalo National Park (W B N P) be exterminated {{and replaced with}} “wood bison ” has no taxonomic justification. The subspecies Bison bison arhubuscae Rhoads 1897 is based on inadequate descriptions and taxonomically invalid criteria- i. e., body size and morphornetrics. Its accepted pelage features are based on studies of the same herd of Nyarling River (NR) bison from Elk Island National Park (EINP). These pelage features, assumed to be genetically fixed, are ecotypic confinement effects, which NR bison share with EINP bull elk and moose. In bison the display hair acts analogous to deer antlers, which reflect their bearers ’ access to highquality food during their growth. NR bison in captivity, in the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary (MBS), and the original wood bison are “northern plains bison. ” Nor are WBNP bison distinguishable from MBS bison. A “wood bison ” phenotype was also described as diagnostic for southern plains bison (B. b. bison Lmaeus 1758); the northern plains bison was named E. b. montanue Krumbiegel 1980. Consequently, E. b. arhubuscae = B. b. bison, as the latter has priority. Yet captive and introduced NR athubuscue = montanue. Some WBNP bison resemble E. priscus, supporting the view that B. bison evolved as a hybrid between American and Siberian large-homed bison.

40|$|The {{southern}} {{limit of}} coral reef {{growth in the}} world occurs on Lord Howe Island (33 ° 302 ̆ 7 S, 159 ° 052 ̆ 7 E) {{in the form of}} a discontinuous 6 -km long fringing reef along the western side of the island. Compared with other fringing reefs worldwide it is large being attached to the shoreline only at its northern and southernmost ends while the central portion encloses a lagoon over a kilometre wide. The reef and lagoon are developed over an antecedent surface composed of reefs of Last Interglacial age and calcarenite dunes; however, there appears to be little relation between its topography and that of the modern surface. Carbonate sediments were being deposited within the lagoon around 6500 years BP coincident with sea level reaching close to its modern level. High-energy open ocean conditions dominated the reef with robust branching corals dominating the developing reef. Sedimentation during this initiation phase strongly reflected the morphology of the antecedent surface. Growth of the reef crest between 6000 and 5000 years B P lead to a reduction in the energy environment of the lagoon allowing for <b>m</b> <b>u</b> <b>d</b> deposition. During this period sedimentation occurred at rates of around 5 mm/yr, but up to 10 mm/yr, which infilled almost all the available accommodation space in the lagoon. By 4000 years BP the reef and lagoon were very close to the modern surface having accumulated over 11 m, possibly up to 30 m, of sediment. Sediments younger than 3000 years BP form a veneer over these older units with the main deposition being confined to embayments, the coastal plain and infilling blue holes. Reef growth and lagoonal infill at the southernmost environmental limit have been luxuriant and rapid, comparable with low-latitude reef systems. The main period of growth occurred during the mid-Holocene. Modern sedimentation appears to be restricted to the lagoon and there is little reef progradation. The reef on Lord Howe therefore appears to be related to luxuriant growth in the mid-Holocene...|$|E

40|$|If {{the masses}} of {{the up and down}} quarks are equal, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the {{fundamental}} theory of the strong interactions, manifests a spin-like symmetry under rotations in the space of the <b>u</b> and <b>d</b> quarks called isospin. Observables which occur only when <b>m</b> <b>u</b> ≠m <b>d</b> (isospin- breaking observables) provide valuable insight into the detailed dynamics of the strong interaction. A convenient and systematic way to study isospin breaking at the level of hadrons is to use the well-established effective chiral Lagrangian approach, which involves a low-energy representation of QCD in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom based only on the symmetries and symmetry- breaking patterns of QCD. In this thesis we investigate two situations where isospin-breaking effects are expected to be significant. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we calculate the amplitudes for the non-leptonic two-pion decays of kaons to next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion, and to first order in isospin-breaking. The objective is to determine the impact of isospin-breaking contributions on the status of the so-called D I = 1 / 2 rule (a large observed enhancement of weak transitions with a change of isospin D I = 1 / 2 over those with a D I = 3 / 2 isospin change). The leading order isospin-breaking effect (in chiral counting) is known, from previous studies, to be a 15 % increase in the ratio of octet to 27 -plet coupling strengths, which reflects the mixing of isospin amplitudes when <b>m</b> <b>u</b> ≠m <b>d.</b> We find that next-to-leading order corrections to the leading order result act to reduce the magnitude of the isospin- breaking effect, yielding a smaller (4 % to 8 %) increase in the ratio described above. The second part of this thesis describes a calculation of the isospin-breaking decay constants of low-lying vector mesons using the QCD sum rule approach. A recently proposed implementation of so-called finite-energy sum rules (FESR) is used to extract these decay constants to high precision. These results are then used to calculate the corrections required to remove some residual isospin- breaking contaminations from the conventionally extracted isovector and isoscalar spectral functions. Such corrections are of significance because of their potential impact on extractions of the strange quark mass, and on tests of the conserved vector current hypothesis (CVC). The calculated isospin-breaking vector meson decay constants also enable a precise determination of one of the low-energy coupling constants, Q, of the 6 th order effective chiral Lagrangian from a dispersion relation for the isospin-breaking vector correlator...|$|R

40|$|Bilingual: English / ItalianThe {{development}} of utopia-driven projective research is necessary given the general condition of unsettlement our society {{finds itself in}} – a condition that raises {{the issue of how}} to maintain the habitability of our world in view of climate change and other societal challenges (Janssens 2012). This condition urges us to take on other ways of thinking, since conventional engineering and technology approaches tend to only produce more of the same. We argue that the mode of thinking embodied in imagineering and projecting is a viable route towards a critical and utopian approach that allows to produce alternatives. Utopia-driven projective research is grounded in architecture and urbanism and aims to integrate scientific modes of knowledge production and design-based, poetic modes of knowledge building. We see it as critical – disagreeing with some protagonists of the so-called ‘criticality-debate’ (Fischer 2012; Heynen 2007) – because utopian thinking starts from a basic uneasiness about current conditions, striving to formulate desirable futures. Likewise, projective thinking can be tuned towards the finding of alternatives for the present, unsustainable urbanization models. We will substantiate this argument by showing, in a diagrammatic way, how conceptual design projects open up a space of possibilities, helping us to start exploring other modes of building communities and relating to the environment. We will refer to four projects that have an urban and landscape scale and scope: The Unadapted City (TOP Office 1995 - 2004), <b>M.</b> <b>U.</b> <b>D</b> (FLCextended 2005), COASTOMIZE!

Using design-thinking can help us to better imagine and conceive how values and judgments can be made productive as active agents in the {{development of}} future counterforms for society (Schuman 1981). These counterforms should not be seen as a kind of fixed and definitive blueprints, but rather as mediating forces that enable and stimulate social transformations. We thus argue for utopian-driven projective research as a form of social transformation in the making – the effort to work through the possibilities of fragmentary change and incomplete, unfinished projects that harbor the desire for better worlds. status: publishe...|$|E

Steady progress in instrumentat ion, incorporating vertical and lateral focusing {{has made it possible}} to contemplate, at this t ime, the gradual replacement of conventional electric logging by a combination of the Induction, spontaneous potent ia l, and short-normal resistivity curves. The basic advantages of Induction over conventional logging are numerous: A) The focused and symmetrical system permits a greater depth of investigation wi thout the loss of detail usually founid wi th increased spacings in conventional logging- (Fig. 1). Whi le it was impossible to read the true resistivities of the oil sands at 3 2 5 0, 3 3 1 0, 3335, 3360, the Induction log gives a close approximat ion of this value in spite of the very th in beds. If some accuracy in obtaining Rt is necessary, rather simple proceedings are available to correct for the bed thickness and the effect of the sur-rounding beds. Obviously, the 6 4 " normal is completely unsuitable for these beds. B) Considerably greater penetration of the Induction log (Fig. 2) gives a better determinat ion of True Resistivity. In case of very fresh mud and low porosity format ions, the effect of invasion is considerable. A t 1 1650 (A), the 6 4 " normal reads 2. 6 ohms, as compared to 1. 2 on the Induction log. A t 1 1587 (B) the 64 " normal reads 5 ohms, instead of 2 on the Induction Log. Whi le the lateral has an excellent depth of investigation, the nonsymmetrical character of the curve makes true resistivity determinations very d i f f icu l t. Shadow zones such as 11614 - 11632 are confusing. To demonstrate the abi l i ty of the Induction to look behind invasion, we can see that the Induction Log reads 1. 0 a t 11660 (C) com-pared to 0. 8 for the lateral. A t this same level the 6 4 " normal reads 4. 5 ohms. Therefore, the Induction log has the advantage of the deep investigation of the lateral wi thout its numerous disadvantages, and is def ini tely super-ior to the 6 4 " normal in showing the true resistivity when dealing wi th deeply invaded water sands...|$|E

The data were ma-lyzed by five-year birth cohorts. The 97 th, 50 th and 3 rd centile curves {{were computed for}} the study sample. They were well below those of the National Center for Health Statis-tics (NCHS). Males were heavier than females for each ccntile. Theseculnr variation wasexamined. It was observed that during the first yea r of life, the weight gain {{of the first three}} cohorts was significantly higher than the last two. From 12 to 48 months there was only a minimal change between cohorts. However,. I-ter 48 months, the last two cohorts showed an improvement in weight as compared to the other three. The boys in our study were far below the 50 th centile for NCHS, fell to the 3 rd centile <b>m</b> <b>u</b> n <b>d</b> 20 months, and gradually declined further. The 97 th centile for boys was above the 50 th NCHS {{during the first year of}} life but fell t h e d t e r until 60 months.

40|$|Isoenzymes from 23 {{isolates}} {{belonging to}} the fungal genus Pleurotus, subdivision Basidiomycotina, were examined by polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing and protein blotting. A numerical analysis was then done based on the zymograms for acid phosphatase, diaphorase, esterases, leucine aminopeptidase, phosphoglucomutase and phenoloxidases. The resulting dendrogram of taxonomic distances demonstrated the suitability of enzyme isoelectric focusing for use in systematics, as it clearly distinguished the four welldehed species P. cornucopk, P. cystidosus, P. eryngu and P. pabellatus. The species P. ostreatus, whose taxonomy is controversial, was separated from P. p <b>u</b> f <b>m</b> <b>d</b> <b>u</b> s, and P. cofumbinus was classified as a distinct taxon. The delimitation of P. sajor-caju and P. sapidus strains appeared {{to be more difficult}} as they seemed to be closely related, the former with P. pufmnarius and the latter with P. ostreatus. Isoenzymes also proved to be valuable for Pfeurotus strain characterization. Their potential application for providing biochemical markers useful in taxonomy is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The December 10 {{election}} result poses several problems {{which must be}} squarely faced by the left. Some o f them are: * To anlayse the reasons for Fraser’s victory * T o d e v e l o p a <b>m</b> <b>u</b> ch <b>d</b> e e p e r understanding of Australian society, in particular the ideology and aspirations of the workers, so as to both understand the vote for Fraser and assist the left to develop the concrete long-term strategy for an ‘Australian road to socialism’. * To devise policies, strategy and tactics to meet the inevitable increase in antiworker, authoritarian and repressive initiatives The election merely confirmed {{in its own way}} a long-observed fact about the working class, in Australia and all capitalist societies: not all the working class, or even a majority of it, will always act in its own best short-term or long-term interests. The working class condition under capitalism can lead it to believe and follow the political representatives o f the class which exploits it; to be taken in by the system and its myths and to reject the real solutions to its problems. This often has been, and is, true {{of some of the most}} oppressed and exploited workers. All the more, then, can it be true of a working class which, on average, enjoys living standards and conditions better than virtually any other subordinate class in history, with the possible exception of the contemporary north American working class...|$|R
