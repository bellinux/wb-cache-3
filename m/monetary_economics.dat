25|$|Bentham's {{opinions}} about <b>monetary</b> <b>economics</b> were {{completely different from}} those of David Ricardo; however, they had some similarities to those of Henry Thornton. He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, propensity to consume, the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern welfare economics.|$|E

2500|$|Applied Economics is the {{application}} of economic theory and econometrics in specific settings. As {{one of the two}} sets of fields of economics (the other set being the core), it is typically characterized by {{the application}} of the core, i.e. economic theory and econometrics, to address practical issues in a range of fields including [...] demographic economics, labour economics, business economics, industrial organization, agricultural economics, development economics, education economics, health economics, <b>monetary</b> <b>economics,</b> public economics, and economic history. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using econometrics, input-output analysis or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the [...] "vernacular". [...] This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings. Among broad methodological distinctions, one source places it in neither positive nor normative economics but the art of economics, glossed as [...] "what most economists do".|$|E

2500|$|The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics {{reports that}} a {{comparison}} of academic studies yields a range of revenue maximizing rates that centers around 70%. In the early 1980s, Edgar L. Feige and Robert T. McGee developed a macroeconomic model from which they derived a Laffer Curve. According to the model, the shape and position of the Laffer Curve depend upon the strength of supply side effects, the progressivity of the tax system {{and the size of}} the unobserved economy. [...] Economist Paul Pecorino presented a model in 1995 that predicted the peak of the Laffer curve occurred at tax rates around 65%. A draft paper by Y. Hsing looking at the United States economy between 1959 and 1991 placed the revenue-maximizing average federal tax rate between 32.67% and 35.21%. A 1981 article published in the Journal of Political Economy presented a model integrating empirical data that indicated that the point of maximum tax revenue in Sweden in the 1970s would have been 70%. A 2011 paper by Trabandt and Uhlig published in the Journal of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Economics</b> presented a model that predicted that the US and most European economies were on the left of the Laffer curve (in other words, that raising taxes would raise further revenue).|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{monetary}} disequilibrium {{in the theory}} of endogenous money. In new consensus <b>economics,</b> <b>monetary</b> disequilibrium is not considered whereas money is endogenous and passive. In post-Keynesian economics, there is an explicit discussion about reconciliation of money demand and supply. Based on careful distinction between money and credit markets, it is argued that monetary disequilibrium can occur even when money is endogenous and therefore money is endogenous and active. This is because of insufficiency of reflux mechanism. The article suggests ways in which new consensus should be supplemented to incorporate this issue. This is also important for monetary policy otherwise a part of transmission mechanism is left out. reflux mechanism, Post-Keynesian economics, new consensus <b>economics,</b> <b>monetary</b> disequilibrium, endogenous money...|$|R
