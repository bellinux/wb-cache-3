We give two additional characterizations of these systems, in spacetime as percolation models, and biologically as population models in which the interactions are due to crowding.

40|$|Abstract: We {{establish}} phase transitions for a {{class of}} continuum <b>multi-type</b> particle <b>systems</b> with finite range repulsive pair interaction between particles of different type. This proves an old conjecture of Lebowitz and Lieb. A phase transition still occurs when we allow a background pair interaction (between all particles) which is superstable and has sufficiently short range of repulsion. Our approach involves a random-cluster representation analogous to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Potts model. In {{the course of our}} argument, we establish the existence of a percolation transition for Gibbsian particle systems with random edges between the particles, and also give an alternative proof for the existence of Gibbs measures with superstable interaction. 1...|$|R

When particles enter in the system according to a Poisson source, Liggett has computed all the limit distributions when the initial distribution has an asymptotic density. In this paper we consider systems for which particles enter at the boundary according to a complex mechanism depending on the current configuration in a finite neighborhood of the origin. For this kind of models, we prove a strong law of large numbers {{for the number of}} particles entered in the system at a given time.

In the case of m types of particles in the rectangular box of size a,b and elongated shape a≫ b we observe that the stationary distribution of particles corresponds to the m-th Laplacian eigenfunction. For smaller elongations a>b we find a configurational transition to a new limiting distribution. The ratio a/b for which the transition occurs is related to the value of the m-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian with rectangular boundaries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the <b>Multi-type</b> Ant Colony <b>system,</b> which is an {{extension}} of the well known Ant System. Unlike the Ant System the ants are of a predefined type. In the <b>Multi-type</b> Ant Colony <b>System</b> ants have the same goal as their fellow types ants, however are in competition with the ants of different types. The collaborative behavior between identical type ants is modeled the same way as in ant systems, i. e. ants are attracted to pheromone of ants of the same type. The competition between different types is obtained because ants are repulsed by the pheromone of ants of other types. This paradigm is interesting for applications where collaboration as well as competition is needed in order to obtain good solutions. In this paper we illustrate the algorithm on the problem of finding disjoint paths in graphs. A first experiment shows on a simple graph two ants types that find successfully two completely disjoint paths. A second experiment shows a more complex graph where the number of required disjoint paths exceeds the number of possible disjoint paths. The results show that the paths found by the ants are distributed proportionally to the cost of the paths. A last experiment shows the influence of the exploration parameter on a complex graph. Good results are obtained if the exploration parameter is gradually decreased. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} phase transitions for a class of continuum <b>multi-type</b> particle <b>systems.</b> The interactions act on hyperedges between the particles, allowing us to define a class of models with geometry-dependent interactions. We establish the existence of stationary Gibbsian point processes for this class of models. A phase transition is defined {{with respect to the}} existence of multiple Gibbs measures, and we establish the existence of phase transitions in our models by proving that multiple Gibbs measures exist. Our approach involves introducing a random-cluster representation for continuum particle systems with geometry-dependent interactions. We then argue that percolation in the random-cluster model corresponds to the existence of a phase transition. The originality in this research is defining a random-cluster representation for continuum models with hyperedge interactions, and applying this representation in order to show the existence of a phase transition. We mainly focus on models where the interaction is defined in terms of the Delaunay hypergraph. We find that phase transitions exist for a class of models where the interaction between particles is via Delaunay edges or Delaunay triangles...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} phase transitions {{for classes}} of continuum Delaunay <b>multi-type</b> particle <b>systems</b> (continuum Potts models) with infinite range repulsive interaction between particles of different type. In one {{class of the}} Delaunay Potts models studied the repulsive interaction is a triangle (multi-body) interaction whereas in the second class the interaction is between pairs (edges) of the Delaunay graph. The result for the edge model {{is an extension of}} finite range results in BBD 04 for the Delaunay graph and in GH 96 for continuum Potts models to an infinite range repulsion decaying with the edge length. This is a proof of an old conjecture of Lebowitz and Lieb. The repulsive triangle interactions have infinite range as well and depend on the underlying geometry and thus are a first step towards studying phase transitions for geometry-dependent multi-body systems. Our approach involves a Delaunay random-cluster representation analogous to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Potts model. The phase transitions manifest themselves in the percolation of the corresponding random-cluster model.

40|$|We {{establish}} phase transitions for continuum Delaunay <b>multi-type</b> particle <b>systems</b> (continuum Potts or Widom-Rowlinson models) with infinite range repulsive {{interaction between}} particles of different type. Our interaction potential depends {{solely on the}} length of the Delaunay edges and is scale invariant up to a parameter replacing the role of inverse temperature. In fact we show that a phase transition occurs for all activities for sufficiently large potential parameter confirming an old conjecture that if phase transition occurs on the Delaunay graph it will be independent of the activity. This is a proof of an old conjecture of Lebowitz and Lieb extended to the Delaunay structure. Our approach involves a Delaunay random-cluster representation analogous to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Potts model. The phase transition manifests itself in the mixed site-bond percolation of the corresponding random-cluster model. Our proofs rely mainly on geometric properties of the Delaunay tessellations in ^ 2 and on recent studies by Dereudre et al. of Gibbs measures for geometry-dependent interactions. The main tool is a uniform bound on the number of connected components in the Delaunay graph which provides a novel approach to Delaunay Widom Rowlinson models based on purely geometric arguments.

40|$|Abundant {{literature}} {{is available for}} the route planning based on meta-heuristic algorithms. However, most researches in this field are developed under normal scenarios (e. g. normal weather conditions). The natural disasters, such as hurricanes, on the contrary, impose hard constraints to these combinatorial problems. In this paper, a route-planning problem is solved, specifically, for the repair of electrical breakdowns that occur after natural disasters. The problem is modeled using an assignment-based integer programming formulation proposed for the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). Moreover, this paper proposes the creative application of an algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), specifically <b>Multi-type</b> Ant Colony <b>System</b> (M-ACS), where each colony represents a set of possible global solutions.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process (asep) in which particles {{jump to the}} right at rate p ∈ (1 / 2, 1] {{and to the left}} at rate 1 − p, interacting by exclusion. In the initial state there is a finite region such that to the left of this region all sites are occupied and to the right of it all sites are empty. Under this initial state, the hydrodynamical limit of the process converges to the rarefaction fan of the associated Burgers equation. In particular suppose that the initial state has first-class particles {{to the left of the}} origin, second-class particles at sites 0 and 1, and holes to the right of site 1. We show that the probability that the two second-class particles eventually collide is (1 + p) / 3 p, where a collision occurs when one of the particles attempts to jump over the other. This also corresponds to the probability that two asep processes, started from appropriate initial states and coupled using the so-called “basic coupling”, eventually reach the same state. We give various other results about the behaviour of second-class particles in the asep. In the totally asymmetric case (p = 1) we explain a further representation in terms of a <b>multi-type</b> particle <b>system,</b> and also use the collision result to derive the probability of coexistence of both clusters in a two-type version of the corner growth model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Burke’s theorem {{can be seen}} as a fixed-point {{result for}} an {{exponential}} single-server queue; when the arrival process is Poisson, the departure process has the same distribu-tion as the arrival process. We consider extensions of this result to multi-type queues, in which different types of customer have different levels of priority. We work with a model of a queueing server which includes discrete-time and continuous-time M/M/ 1 queues as well as queues with exponential or geometric service batches occurring in discrete time or at points of a Poisson process. The fixed-point results are proved using inter-changeability properties for queues in tandem, which have previously been established for one-type M/M/ 1 systems. Some of the fixed-point results have previously been derived as a consequence of the construction of stationary distributions for <b>multi-type</b> interact-ing particle <b>systems,</b> and we explain the links between the two frameworks. The fixed points have interesting “clustering ” properties for lower-priority customers. An extreme case is an example of a Brownian queue, in which lower-priority work only occurs at a set of times of measure 0 (and corresponds to a local time process for the queue-length process of higher priority work). ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} systems (SHMS) play {{important roles in}} assuring the serviceability and safety of some critical infrastructures during their long service lives. The operational performance of SHMS substantially relies on the features of sensor system, including types, number and spatial allocation in structures. Since the number of sensors is always limited compared with degrees-of-freedom of a large-scale structure, the determination of sensor number and locations becomes a critical issue encountered {{in the design and}} implementation of an effective SHMS. Meanwhile, the fast development of sensor technology makes various types of sensors available for structural health monitoring purpose, enabling the monitoring of both global behavior and local response. Even though such comprehensive SHMS have been instrumented in many newlybuilt critical structures, surprisingly little work in the literature focuses on the optimal design of global and local sensors for structural health monitoring. Therefore, this paper attempts to addresses this knowledge gap-the location selection and data fusion of a <b>multi-type</b> sensor <b>system</b> in a structure including displacement transducers, accelerometers and strain gauges, all of which are commonly used in SHMS. The number and locations of the three types of sensors are optimized with the objective of minimizing the estimation error of unobserved structural responses based on incomplete measurement. Unlike traditional approaches for sensor placement in which each type sensors are designed separately, this study designs the whole sensor system simultaneously. By minimizing the overall estimation errors at the locations of interest and reducing estimation errors to a desired target level, the initial set of candidate sensor locations is reduced to a smaller optimal set. Kalman filter algorithm is employed in the sensor placement and data fusion. A numerical examples-a twodimensional truss structure-was presented to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach for the location selection and data fusion of multi-type sensors.

There is no binding energy between neighboring particles of the same type. We start the dynamics from the empty box and compute the transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a critical droplet appearing somewhere in the box. We identify the region of parameters for which the system is metastable. For this region, in the limit as the temperature tends to zero, we show that the fi??rst entrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, compute the expected transition time up to and including a multiplicative factor of order one, and prove that the transition time divided by its expectation is exponentially distributed.

Seventy-seven of the 145 CARLI library directors sampled completed the web-based survey. This represented a 53. 1 % response rate. The framework for the survey was designed around three sections; advantages, disadvantages, and obstacles to participating in I-Share. Directors were asked to select the level of importance of I-Share benefits, and their level of agreement to questions regarding the disadvantages and obstacles to participating in I-Share. These questions {{were based on a}} Likert scale and assigned numeric values. An independent samples t-test compared I-Share and non I-Share directors’ responses by institution type and collectively. The difference in 11 of 12 comparisons was found to be statistically significant. Through five open-ended questions, several themes were discovered. Benefits associated with resource sharing were consistently stated as being the most influential factor for I-Share member directors to participate in I-Share. Other important benefits mentioned were I-Share’s value, centralized technical support, and the opportunity to collaborate closely with other libraries.
