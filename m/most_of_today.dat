Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano.

At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats.

50|$|The band {{is noted}} for its {{experimental}} approach. Sampling and electronics have {{played an important role}} in the band's music since Supernova. Their 1996 self-titled album lacked any bass guitars, using keyboards instead (the bass lines were played by keyboardist Scott Wexton) and featured prominent noise and industrial influences. Dialogues and sound clips sampled from movies are also frequently used, mostly on Temple of the Morning Star and In the Eyes of God; some of the movies sampled throughout their discography are Memento, The Illustrated Man, The Holy Mountain, Chopper, Rosemary's Baby, Dune, Goodfellas, Carrie and Waco: The Rules of Engagement among others. The 2002 double album Sadness Will Prevail introduced string instruments and piano and also featured extensive electronics, field recordings, sound manipulation, acoustic guitars, sampling and unusual production techniques. Some of the bands recorings display a more stripped down and straightforward approach with less use of electronics and experimentation, such as Kiss The Pig and Pain is a Warning. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>Today</b> Is The Days's albums are recorded and produced by Steve Austin in his own studio Austin Enterprise and the band's production often displays bizarre, unorthodox recording techniques and multiple effects; as noted in the multi-layered vocals and dissonant guitar work.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRate-based {{congestion}} control, such as TFRC, has {{not been}} designed to enable reliability. Indeed, the birth of TFRC protocol has resulted from {{the need for a}} congestion-controlled transport protocol in order to carry multimedia traffic. However, certain applications still prefer the use of UDP in order to implement their own congestion control on top of it. The present contribution proposes to design and validate a reliable rate-based protocol based on the combined use of TFRC, SACK and an adapted flow control. We argue that rate-based congestion control is a perfect alternative to window-based congestion control as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> applications need to interact with the transport layer and should not be only limited to unreliable services.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for finding regions of planar surfaces in data given as three-dimensional points {{located in a}} (possibly incomplete) grid. It was motivated by noisy range data obtained from IFSAR or stereo correlation. The procedure basically consists of the following steps: (a) fitting of robust planar patches, (b) region merging, (c) region refinement, (d) region splitting, and (e) boundary finding. The steps (b) [...] (d) are iterated until a convergence criterion is met. A major design principle {{was the lack of}} assumptions about specific characteristics of the input data. Hence, heuristic parameters common in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 's range image segmenters were avoided where possible. Rather, the same fit criteria are applied at all steps of the procedure. The algorithm can incorporate information from optical imagery where available, and cooperate with higher-level site reconstruction tasks.

It is therefore appropriate to introduce additional restrictions, thus obtaining solvable subclasses. In our recent paper, published in this same journal, the restrictions just mentioned were semidirectedness and an upper bound {{on the size of the}} gap within a column. In this paper, the semidirectedness requirement is made looser. The result is that now the exactly solved subclasses are larger and have greater growth constants.
