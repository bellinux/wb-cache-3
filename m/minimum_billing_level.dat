40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{evaluate}} the impact of a large-scale field deployment of mandatory timeof-use (TOU) pricing on the energy use of commercial and industrial firms. The regulation imposes higher user prices during hours when electricity is generally more expensive to produce, and {{is by far the most}} common way for time-varying incentives to be transmitted to retail electricity customers. We exploit a natural experiment that arises from the rules governing the program to present evidence that TOU pricing induced no (or very little) change in customer usage or load. As such, economic efficiency was not increased by this regulation. <b>Bill</b> <b>levels</b> and volatility exhibit only minor shifts, suggesting that concerns from advocacy groups about increased expenditure and customer exposure to risk have been overstated...|$|R

40|$|A typical gas sales {{agreement}} (GSA) also called a gas swing contract, is {{an agreement between}} a supplier and a purchaser for the delivery of variable daily quantities of gas, between specified minimum and maximum daily limits, over {{a certain number of}} years at a specified set of contract prices. The main constraint of such an agreement that makes them difficult to value are that in each gas year there is a minimum volume of gas (termed take-or-pay or <b>minimum</b> <b>bill)</b> for which the buyer will be charged {{at the end of the}} year (or penalty date), regardless of the actual quantity of gas taken. We propose a framework for pricing such swing contracts for an underlying gas forward price curve that follows a regime-switching process in order to better capture the volatility behaviour in such markets. With the help of a recombing pentanonial tree, we are able to efficiently evaluate the prices of the swing contracts, find optimal daily decisions and optimaly early use of both the make-up bank and the carry forward bank at different regimes. We also show how the change of regime will affect the decisions. gas {{sales agreement}}; swing contract; take-or-pay; make-up; carry forward; forward price curve; regime switching volatility; recombing pentanomial tree...|$|R

40|$|The use of roll calls is {{ubiquitous}} {{in studies of}} the U. S. Congress. A particularly heavy reliance on roll calls characterizes much of the empirical work that examines the various theoretical claims regarding legislative organization. This paper shifts the focus of analysis to individual bills {{in an attempt to}} obtain an alternative picture of the broader context in which House decision-making occurs. Drawing on evidence spanning four Congresses across a 24 -year period, we find that consensus is far more common than conflict in House decision making. Furthermore, our analysis at the <b>bill</b> <b>level</b> facilitates an examination of the context in which committees operate and the ensuing floor environment. Systematic analysis provides insight into the factors attending to the degree of consensus and conflict associated with bills, and paints a more complete picture of the day-to-day environment of the U.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To better {{understand}} the reasons why some fee-for-service physicians have high <b>billing</b> <b>levels,</b> the authors compared the practice and demographic characteristics of general practitioners and family physicians (GP/FPs) who submitted over $ 400, 000 in annual Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) fee-for-service claims in 1994 - 95 with those of GP/FPs who billed between $ 35, 000 and $ 400, 000. METHODS: The authors describe the OHIP billing and physician characteristic data for fiscal year 1994 - 95. They used multivariate logistic regression to determine factors independently associated with high billing status. RESULTS: A total of 219 GP/FPs (2. 5 % of the GP/FPs in Ontario) billed over $ 400, 000 in 1994 - 95. Of these, 14 had billing patterns {{similar to those of}} specialists, and 27 billed predominantly for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (particularly physiotherapy). The remaining 178 (81. 3 %) billed for a mix of services similar to that of other GP/FPs but on average had 2. 6 times the volume of patient assessments and a greater share of their total billings derived from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (9. 1 % v. 5. 6 %). Multivariate analysis indicated that these high-volume GP/FPs were less likely than GP/FPs who billed between $ 35, 000 and $ 400, 000 to be 60 years of age or older (odds ratio [OR] 0. 09, p < 0. 05) and female (OR 0. 21) and {{were more likely to be}} foreign graduates (OR 1. 85) and practising in a region with low physician supply (OR 0. 45 for each increase of 1 physician per 1000 population). Metropolitan Toronto was an outlier to the latter relation and was more likely to have high-volume GP/FPs (OR 16. 89). INTERPRETATION: High-billing GP/FPs attained their high <b>billing</b> <b>levels</b> by maintaining large numbers of patient visits and by performing procedures. Further research is needed to determine the time spent per patient and the quality of care delivered by these physicians as well as the appropriateness of the procedures that they perform...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{investment}} for power factor correcting capacitors for Kansas Power and Light Company large power contract customers is studied. Since the billing capacity {{is determined by}} dividing the real demand by the power factor (the <b>minimum</b> <b>billing</b> capacity is based on 80 percent of the summer peak billing capacity) and the billing capacity is {{used to determine the}} number of kilowatt-hours billed at each pricing tier, the power factor affects both the demand and the energy charge. There is almost no information available in the literature concerning recommended power factor corrections for this situation. The general advice commonly given in the past has been that power factor should be corrected to above 0. 9 if it is below that value to begin with, but that {{does not take into account}} the facts of the situation studied here. Calculations relevant to a commercial consumer of electricity were made for demands of 200, 400, 800, 1, 600, 3, 200, and 6, 400 kW and monthly energy consumption periods of 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 hours for several capacitor purchase and installation costs. The results are displayed in a series of graphs that enable annual cost savings and payback periods to be readily determined over a range of commonly encountered parameter values.
