More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his immediate surroundings.

This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
