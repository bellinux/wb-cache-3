5|$|Avici/Avicimat (waterless/waveless): A person, who lies on oath or in business, is {{repeatedly}} thrown head-first from a 100 yojana {{high mountain}} whose sides are stone waves, but without water. His body is continuously broken, {{but it is}} <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he does not die.|$|E
5|$|Although Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was not given the complete allowances that he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative, when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores (13 million)—his arrears of pay for over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it ain't there," [...] said Mr. Chase, finally. [...] "I've <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b> That's {{something}} towards it. I shan't 'ave to {{look there}} again, thank goodness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow night, at any rate," [...] he said, [...] "there {{will be no}} article. We have <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b> I pray to Heaven {{that it may not}} be too late!" ...|$|R

5|$|Then, whilst {{the army}} was camped in Macedon, the Brygians, a local Thracian tribe, {{launched}} a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius. Despite his injury, Mardonius <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; {{the remnants of the}} navy also retreated to Asia. Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been made aware of Darius's intentions for them.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{professor}} had <b>made</b> himself <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{the guards}} who accompanied him spoke nothing but French. Without referring to Banker's proposed bargain, {{he said to}} him, [...] "Was {{the captain of the}} bandits under whom you served a Spaniard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a great {{temptation to}} housebreakers," [...] said her sister, not {{pressing}} the point. [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> last night <b>that</b> I heard {{somebody in the}} house." ...|$|R

5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> deals could be made.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the 2035 underground {{world would}} only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means}} to depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E
60|$|Unconsciously {{the two men}} quickened their pace. Yet {{they did}} not relax from their caution. Twice they changed their course {{in order to avoid}} policemen, and they <b>made</b> very <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they were not {{observed}} when they dived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town.|$|R
6000|$|... "To confess, then," [...] murmured Izz, [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> to-day <b>that</b> he {{was going}} to kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast, hoping and hoping, and never moved at all. But he did not. I don't like biding here at Talbothays any longer! I shall go hwome." ...|$|R
60|$|Once safe, he {{felt much}} better. Except that Jeff did put on white kid gloves, Milt couldn't {{see that they}} two looked so different. And neither {{of the two men}} in the next box wore gloves. Milt <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that</b> comfort; he reveled in it; he looked at Claire, and in her loyal smile found ease.|$|R
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|Though Sam Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was never given the complete allowances he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores–his arrears of pay for over 30 years. Even more surprisingly, Manekshaw's funeral was not attended by the top brass from civil, military, or political leadership.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
60|$|Lady Elizabeth {{read the}} {{marriage}} among the advertisements in the Times, {{and at once}} took it to Sir Harry, withdrawing the paper from the room in a manner which <b>made</b> Emily <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{there was something in}} it which she was not intended to see. But Sir Harry thought that the news should be told to her, and he himself told it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Commissions in the Yeomanry!" [...] he repeated, and {{his eyes}} and face, which became startling and separate, {{like those of a}} boiled lobster, <b>made</b> me feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he had {{something}} of the kind himself.|$|R
5000|$|... "Quite {{the most}} charming, friendly, unassuming and courteous man in motor racing... His {{furniture}} factory {{was an extremely}} paternalistic, caring concern, in which long-term employees were looked after virtually to the grave. When they became too old for their regular work they might be put onto lighter duties for a lesser wage, but there'd always be something for them, Johnson <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b>|$|R
5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
60|$|The {{explanation}} that followed was {{not by any}} means calculated to allay the irritation of the British captain. He had <b>made</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Red Eric was the slaver of which he was in search, and the discovery of his mistake induced him to make several rather severe remarks in reference to the crew of the Red Eric generally and her commander in particular.|$|R
60|$|Some days later--it {{may have}} been the next week; the exact date appears to have got mislaid--Marigold, M.P., looked in on the Professor. They talked about Tariff Reform, and then Marigold got up and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> for himself <b>that</b> the door was tight closed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Stirling, [...] "at the moment, you're {{the only}} people anxious to buy; but I've only to send that {{certificate}} and a nicely worked-up account of the rich new find around to the press, and everybody with a dollar to spare will be wanting Grenfell stock. Still, there'll be no shares available--I've <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b> I'll ask you, as men with some knowledge of these matters, where's the price going to?" ...|$|R
5|$|Mardonius {{moved to}} break the stalemate, by {{offering}} peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary. The Athenians <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not. The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days. However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and {{went to great lengths}} to attend to them. The production staff <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|Scotty Wiseman, of the duo Lulu Belle and Scotty, was {{a friend}} of Lunsford's. When Lulu Belle and Scotty needed one more song to finish a 1935 record for Vocalion Records, Wiseman {{suggested}} using the song his friend had written. To make the piece appeal to more people, Wiseman added the modern chorus and replaced verses about a man appearing in court with verses about making moonshine. Two years later, at the National Folk Festival in Chicago, Wiseman showed his version to Lunsford. Lunsford was impressed with it; later the same night, he sold the song to Wiseman for $25 ($ in 2013) so he could buy a train ticket back to North Carolina. Wiseman copyrighted the song and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> 50% of the royalties it earned were given to Lunsford until Lunsford's death.|$|E
50|$|Everton won the First Division {{title for}} the seventh time in the club's history <b>that</b> season. They <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that</b> on April 1, with a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park. Sheffield Wednesday went down on April 22, after losing 2-1 at home to Manchester City whilst Sunderland went with them 7 days earlier losing 1-0 at home to Liverpool, which a win would have saved them from relegation {{at the expense of}} Crystal Palace.|$|R
60|$|One {{night when}} Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find {{something}} to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite, Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's hand. The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines <b>made</b> her <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> tears had fallen on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as she pressed the hand to her bosom. Something had <b>made</b> her <b>sure</b> today <b>that</b> her child loved her--needed her as much as ever.|$|R
