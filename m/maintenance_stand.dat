40|$|Objective Physical {{inactivity}} {{and poor}} dietary habits plague Americans as health challenges, with {{women of color}} most vulnerable to their detrimental effects. Individually focused interventions have not demonstrated lasting success, possibly {{due to the lack}} of focus on sustainable social and physical environment factors. This manuscript describes the rationale, design and methodology of Health Is Power (HIP), a transcultural, community based, randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of a group cohesion intervention to increase physical activity and improve dietary habits in African American and Hispanic or Latina women in Houston and Austin, Texas. Methods The intervention development was guided by group dynamics principles anchored within an ecologic model. Results Women participated in three health assessments and a six month face to face intervention that included evidence-based behavioral methods – integrated into strategies to promote group cohesion – framed to account for environmental factors contributing to health disparities. Women participated in team building activities, environmental mapping exercises, and supervised walks or taste tests. Conclusions Neighborhood contextual and environmental measures are described to test ecologic factors that may contribute to behavioral maintenance.

We show the use of PSOM for defining processes using the aggregation constructs and arranging these processes into class hierarchies based on the formal types of the processes.

A system governed by tight routines might be expected to learn only gradually and slowly. The paper discusses how the combination of routines with the accumulation and rapid diffusion of “learning-by-using” mechanisms at different levels of the network of actors directly and indirectly involved in aircraft maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Many {{indicators}} and criteria {{have been proposed}} to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management ‘‘shortcuts’’ such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based {{on a set of}} five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>stand</b> structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e. g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e. g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management ‘‘natural experiments’’ and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, 2010 The role of {{fire in the}} {{maintenance}} of Quercus-dominated ecosystems is widely recognized. Variability in surface fuels is a mechanism rooted in the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>stand</b> structure. This study examined fuelbed heterogeneity, fire behavior, and young conifer mortality within Quercus garryana woodlands and grasslands in the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park, California, USA. Woodlands were stratified into five structural communities: grassland; oak savanna; oak cluster; oak woodland; and woodland invaded by Pseudotsuga menziesii (invaded woodland). Live and dead fuel moisture and fuel mass (Mg ha- 1) in three fuel strata (herbaceous, litter, woody) were sampled in the summers of 2008 and 2009. Fire temperature maxima during prescribed burns were measured with pyrometers. Across woodland structural communities, results reveal herbaceous mass decreases markedly from a high in grassland (3. 38 ?? 0. 19 Mg ha- 1) to a low in invaded woodland (0. 03 ?? 0. 03 Mg ha- 1) (p < 0. 001), whereas leaf litter and woody fuel mass increase significantly along this gradient (p < 0. 001). Mean fire temperatures ranged from 74. 7 ??C in invaded woodland up to 207. 9 ??C in grassland, but {{did not differ significantly}} across structural communities. P. menziesii invasion ultimately dampens flammability through increased fuel moisture, replacement of herbaceous with woody fuels, and altered understory micro-climate. To prevent invasion by P. menziesii, managers use prescribed fire to kill fire-sensitive saplings. Post-fire mortality was monitored for 100 P. menziesii saplings following a prescribed burn. The fire resulted in 50 percent mortality of conifer seedlings and saplings, with strong patterns in the drivers of individual tree injury. Percent crown volume scorched was the most important factor affecting initial mortality status, and was related to cambium injury (r = 0. 67). Prescribed fire is a valuable tool for {{the maintenance}} of oak woodlands and grasslands, but the achievement of desired fire effects in these ecosystems may depend on site-specific burning strategies to account for alterations in fuelbeds and flammability across structural communities.
