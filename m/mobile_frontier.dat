In late August 1813, with Peter McQueen and other Red Sticks, Weatherford participated in a retaliatory attack on Fort Mims. It was a hastily built civilian stockade on the lower Alabama River, about 35 miles north of <b>Mobile.</b> <b>Frontier</b> American families and Lower Creek had retreated to the fort, which was ineptly guarded. The Red Sticks gained entry into the fort and massacred the Lower Creek, as well as European-American settlers, including women and children. Estimates are that they killed up to 500 persons. Some 35 individuals survived. As a prominent leader, Weatherford was {{held responsible for the}} massacre, although there are reports he tried to prevent it. [...] An Alabama militia followed up with another Ranger unit and maneuvered the Red Sticks into battle at the Battle of Holy Ground. Red Eagle (Weatherford) barely escaped capture, jumping from a bluff into the Alabama River while on horseback. Having repelled the Red Stick invasion in a number of skirmishes and forced them on the defensive, the Americans regrouped for a final offensive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{strategy}} for resolving multiple hypotheses of a robot’s state during global localization. The strategy operates in two stages. In the first stage a unique direction of the motion is sought that resolves or eliminates maximum number of hypotheses. In the second stage, among the frontier areas arising from the multiple hypotheses states, that frontier is chosen which resolves {{the maximum number of}} the hypotheses. The two stages are alternated till a unique hypothesis emerges. Simulation and experimental results verify the efficacy of this method. A comparison with other methods based on entropy minimization, and minimum distance travel portrays the advantage of the current methodology. A convergence proof for the algorithm is also presented.

Embora exista uma grande variedade de temas e abordagens diferenciadas, a produ&ccedil;&atilde;o hist&oacute;rica apresenta inumer&aacute;veis vazios tem&aacute;ticos, temporais e regionais, que s&oacute; come&ccedil;aram a ser abordados desde a d&eacute;cada de 1990. A historiografia social provincial, neste particular, n&atilde;o &eacute; uma exce&ccedil;&atilde;o, mas participa desta caracter&iacute;stica geral da historiografia social argentina e latino-americana. Destarte aparece como um campo novo em forma&ccedil;&atilde;o, que registra uma produ&ccedil;&atilde;o quantitativa n&atilde;o muito prol&iacute;fera, diversa quanto a seu conte&uacute;do e linhas de abordagem e com muitos vazios.

The social History {{has been}} shaped and expanded as a study field of vague and <b>mobile</b> <b>frontiers</b> and the History of the social Argentinean histography is a clear example of this. Although {{there is a great}} variety of topics and differentiated approaches, the historical production still presents countless thematic, temporal and regional vacuums that have started to be considered only since the 90 &acute;s. The provincial social histography is not an exception in this aspect; on the contrary, it shares this general characteristic of the Argentinean and Latin America social histography. Therefore, it appears as a new field in formation that registers not a very quantitatively prolific production, diverse in its content and lines of approach, and with many vacuums. These characteristics are more stressed {{in the case of the}} historical researches devoted to the study of social groups, where the production is very atomized, with the additional problem that many of these works deal with the problem of the constitution and the activation of the groups as a tangible aspect of a more omnicomprehensive. object of knowledge. Within this context, our intention is to offer a critical reflection on the ways of constructing historical accounts. We are convinced that one of the challenges that the contemporary historian has, in the postmodern era, is to rethink and redefine the way in which we research and write History, that is, we attempt at delineating the methodological aspects of the research and the writing of History. In the analysis of the works chosen as representatives, we had borne in mind: the historical contexts of production, the sense and the scope of the suggested interpretations, the textual organization and the influence, reception and appropriation of the European, American and national trends in the provincial historical production. ...|$|R

Both the policy’s proponents and opponents often rely on a too restrictive inside/outside distinction and do not properly acknowledge the peculiar territorialities which ‘EU’rope projects within and beyond its borders. While this limit has at times been perpetrated in scholarly debates on the topic, this article presents a review of recent research which, from different disciplinary backgrounds, converges in proposing more decentered and ‘unbounded’ perspectives for inquiring into EU’s approach towards its neighbouring countries. EU external policies are a peculiar assemblage of inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and securitization, approximation and distantiation which cannot be properly captured by metaphors {{such as that of}} the “wider Europe” or “fortress Europe”. We discuss recent perspectives about European normative power, external governance and Europeanization, policy transfer and diffusion which show how regionalization and bordering processes are neither contradictory nor divergent but proceed side-by-side in an attempt to construct a selective, fragmented and <b>mobile</b> EU external <b>frontier.</b> These perspectives are crucial for renovating our understanding of EU’s external relations and the Neighbourhood Policy both theoretically and methodologically, particularly in light of the EU’s decreasing leverage and ongoing transformations in ‘EU’rope and its neighbourhood...|$|R
40|$|A new nomad {{society is}} colonizing the desert {{landscape}} of the American Southwest. It is a leaderless seasonal swarm, dispersed but densely connected socially, able to form and disband agile urban communities the size of large American cities. It consists of highway bound leisure hunters driving extremely wasteful vehicles that while parked are able form a dense and resilient pioneer society. They are predominantly retired and constructing a new American dream, an informal utopia created from potlucks, social media, satellite dishes and <b>mobile</b> homes. This <b>frontier</b> society of urban flexibilization, decentralization and total urbanization {{is a product of}} the complexity and uncertainties of cities being amplified by technological and social disruption, climate change and economic crises. In a mobile future, informal and temporary uses will be important drivers of development and the urban periphery a breeding ground for new forms of urbanism. How do we govern, plan for and understand this development? The nomad cities are poorly documented and understood, especially in academia. With this thesis I aim to change that. I have conducted extensive field studies, including both quantitative mapping and semi-structured qualitative interviews. The data has been analyzed using a theoretical framework consisting of network theory of Castells, spatial analysis ideas of Lefebvre, Venturi, Friedman, Deleuze and Guattari, and social theories of Bourdieu, Foucault and Standing among others. The basic building block of the nomad city are recreational vehicles (RVs); trailers, motorhomes and camper vans. The RV is in itself a hybrid phenomenon that embodies conflicting ideals of the American society: total freedom of movement, the reinvention of the self on the frontier and the American dream. It is both individualistic and community based, and it’s urban forms are highly adaptable to societal changes, mirroring society’s development as well as the changing landscape it inhabits. It recreates itself and revises its citizens’ common habitus with every iteration. The RV world contains multiple layers of meaning for our increasingly urbanized society. It is a frontier for the expansion of exurbia and a physical manifestations of the network society. It creates small initiatives that create ripple effects and thereby a transformation of the urban fabric. To encourage these practices the role of planning needs to be revised. It should not primarily be to decide what is built but to enable the emerging practices that are there. Instead of presenting a grand plan we should allow a multitude of bottom up processes to lead development. In the words of Cedric Price: “The primary aim of planning is not to specify an ideal state but to open up to new possibilities”...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} mobile devices {{in everyday life}} is posing {{a broad range of}} research challenges to meet such a massive data demand. Mobile users seek connectivity "anywhere, at anytime". In addition, killer applications with multimedia contents, like video transmissions, require larger amounts of resources to cope with tight quality constraints. Spectrum scarcity and interference issues represent the key aspects of next generation wireless networks. Consequently, designing proper resource management solutions is critical. To this aim, we first propose a model to better assess the performance of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) -based simulated cellular networks. A link abstraction of the downlink data transmission can provide an accurate performance metric at a low computational cost. Our model combines Mutual Information-based multi-carrier compression metrics with Link-Level performance profiles, thus expressing the dependency of the transmitted data Block Error Rate (BLER) on the SINR values and on the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) being assigned. In addition, we aim at evaluating the impact of Jumboframes transmission in LTE networks, which are packets breaking the 1500 -byte legacy value. A comparative evaluation is performed based on diverse network configuration criteria, thus highlighting specific limitations. In particular, we observed rapid buffer saturation under certain circumstances, due to the transmission of oversized packets with scarce radio resources. A novel cross-layer approach is proposed to prevent saturation, and thus tune the transmitted packet size with the instantaneous channel conditions, fed back through standard CQI-based procedures. Recent advances in wireless networking introduce the concept of resource sharing as one promising way to enhance the performance of radio communications. As the wireless spectrum is a scarce resource, and its usage is often found to be inefficient, it may be meaningful to design solutions where multiple operators join their efforts, so that wireless access takes place on shared, rather than proprietary to a single operator, frequency bands. In spite of the conceptual simplicity of this idea, the resulting mathematical analysis may be very complex, since it involves analytical representation of multiple wireless channels. Thus, we propose an evaluative tool for spectrum sharing techniques in OFDMA-based wireless networks, where multiple sharing policies can be easily integrated and, consequently, evaluated. On the other hand, relatively to contention-based broadband wireless access, we target an important issue in mobile ad hoc networks: the intrinsic inefficiency of the standard transmission control protocol (TCP), which presents degraded performance mainly due to mechanisms such as congestion control and avoidance. In fact, TCP was originally designed for wired networks, where packet losses indicate congestion. Conversely, channels in wireless networks might vary rapidly, thus most loss events are due to channel errors or link layer contention. We aim at designing a light-weight cross-layer framework which, differently from many other works in the literature, is based on the cognitive network paradigm. It includes an observation phase, i. e., a training set in which the network parameters are collected; a learning phase, in which the information to be used is extracted from the data; a planning phase, in which we define the strategies to trigger; an acting phase, which corresponds to dynamically applying such strategies during network simulations. The next generation <b>mobile</b> infrastructure <b>frontier</b> relies on the concept of heterogeneous networks. However, the existence of multiple types of access nodes poses new challenges such as more stringent interference constraints due to node densification and self-deployed access. Here, we propose methods that aim at extending femto cells coverage range by enabling idle User Equipments (UE) to serve as relays. This way, UEs otherwise connected to macro cells can be offloaded to femto cells through UE relays. A joint resource allocation and user association scheme based on the solutions of a convex optimization problem is proposed. Another challenging issue to be addressed in such scenarios is admission control, which is in charge of ensuring that, when a new resource reservation is accepted, previously connected users continue having their QoS guarantees honored. Thus, we consider different approaches to compute the aggregate projected capacity in OFDMA-based networks, and propose the E-Diophantine solution, whose mathematical foundation is provided along with the performance improvements to be expected, both in accuracy and computational terms...|$|R
