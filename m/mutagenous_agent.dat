40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of using}} the method of the induced mutagenesis in the fishes selection; to study the efficiency as the <b>mutagenous</b> <b>agent</b> of the short-wave UV-radiation. For the first time, it has been shown, that the UV-radiation of the fishes sperm brings to the increase of the genetypic variation of the quantitative, selection-improtant signs in the posterity. The peculiarities of reparation of the carp embryos have been described after UV-radiation of the gametes. The method of the UV-mutagenesis of the carp, allowing to increase the efficiency of selection has been developed for the improvement of the productivity signsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: {{studying}} the induced mutation process of the cross-pollution plants in the nearest and remote populations from the mutagenous action. The data about the value, character of action and methods of regulation of the mutation variation pool in the panmictic populations have been received. Shown has been the specificity of action of the <b>mutagenous</b> <b>agents</b> {{on the base of}} reaction of the cells and tissues on the physiological loads. Obtained and subjected to the state sort-test has been the meadow fescue "Onezhskaya"; subjected to the preliminary tests have been five lines of the different character of growth, rroductive and frost-proof onesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
