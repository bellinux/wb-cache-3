25|$|Mitsubishi {{developed}} new <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade,</b> Ship Landing Assist System, new avionics system, {{and other}} systems. Two prototypes SH-60Ks were built by modifying SH-60Js. These prototypes were completed and delivered by June 2002. The SH-60K's cabin was expanded in length by 30cm (11.8in) and in height by 15cm (5.91in) {{compared to the}} SH-60J. The larger cabin allows for the new avionics system. Those and the airframe changes are compensated by the exchange of the T700-IHI-401C2 engine. The first production SH-60K was delivered to JMSDF on 10 August 2005. A total of 50 SH-60Ks are being supplied under new production.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{swashplate}} is {{a device}} that translates input via the helicopter flight controls into motion of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> Because the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are spinning, the swashplate is used to transmit three of the pilot's commands from the non-rotating fuselage to the rotating rotor hub and mainblades.|$|R

2500|$|One {{modification}} for the S-61 is the Carson Composite <b>Main</b> <b>Rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> These blades {{replace the}} original Sikorsky metal blades which {{are prone to}} fatigue. The Carson Composite Main Rotor blades permit a modified aircraft to carry an additional [...] load, fly [...] faster and increase range [...]|$|E
2500|$|The S-67 {{featured}} a five-bladed main rotor and tail rotor. The main rotor {{was taken from}} the S-61, but was modified to have a hub fairing, swept <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> tips and a special [...] "alpha-1" [...] linkage which was added to the main rotor controls to increase collective pitch sensitivity and so extend the collective pitch range. The 20Â° swept <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> tips help to overcome a phenomenon called sub-multiple oscillating track (SMOT) that causes variations in tip track at high Mach numbers. [...] These allowed the S-67 to achieve and maintain high cruise speeds. To reduce drag at high speed, the mainwheels retracted fully into the stub wing sponsons. It had speed brakes on the wing trailing edges {{that could be used to}} decrease speed or increase maneuverability.|$|E
2500|$|Statements were {{obtained}} from 91 witnesses. A consensus of their observations indicates that the helicopter was proceeding along a normal flightpath when a loud noise or unusual sound was heard. [...] A <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> was either observed to separate or was seen separated {{in the vicinity of}} the main rotor disc. As the helicopter fell in variously described gyrations, the tail cone either folded or separated. [...] In order to establish an approximate altitude for the flight, several comparative flights were conducted in a similar helicopter. [...] Most witnesses indicated the flights at [...] to [...] appeared to be most accurate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed in}} Lueders Park in Compton, a recreational park {{located in a}} residential area bordering Rosecrans Avenue. [...] The entire fuselage, both engines, main rotor head assembly, four main rotor blades, and the pylon assembly were located in the main impact area. [...] The fifth <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> (yellow) including the sleeve and part of spindle, was located approximately 0.25 miles (0.4km) north-west of the main wreckage site. [...] Minor parts associated with this rotor blade were scattered over a three-block area northwest of the park. [...] Examination of the yellow blade spindle (S/N AJ19) revealed a fatigue fracture in the shank of the spindle adjacent to the shoulder in the inboard end of the shank.|$|E
2500|$|Rescuers {{reached the}} site in less than 10 minutes to find just one <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> and an oil slick on the water. The {{wreckage}} of the helicopter itself was located by sonar operators on the Estonian Maritime Administration vessel EVA-320, who indicated that the aircraft was intact {{at a depth of}} roughly [...] Two Estonian deep-sea divers following an earlier unmanned robotic vehicle reported that the bodies of the passengers were inside the craft. Thirteen bodies were retrieved, with one pilot missing. [...] The recovery mission was hindered by rough weather conditions. The wreckage of the aircraft was lifted on 13 August 2005 and transported to Tallinn for investigation. [...] The missing pilot was not found in the initial searches performed by the Estonian and Finnish authorities, but the body was finally located on 25 August and retrieved by volunteer divers some distance away from the accident site. The post mortem indicated that the victims died from drowning.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon {{was attached to the}} helicopter for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As the {{helicopter was}} departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of the helicopter the hook freed itself [...] towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|E
