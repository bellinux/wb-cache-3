500|$|The first {{plans to}} restore the {{national}} museum came in 1992 from Michel Edde, then Minister of Culture and Higher Education. The proposal {{to tear down the}} concrete walls and cases which protected the national treasures was turned down by the general director of antiquities, Camille Asmar, since the museum still had no doors or windows to prevent further looting. [...] Ghassan Tueni donated the funds for the museum's massive new main door. Once the doors and windows were put in, {{the decision was made to}} pull down the concrete wall that protected the entrance to the basement. Restoration work started in 1995 and focused on the building itself, and the inventorying and restoration of the collection. The museum was officially inaugurated on November 25, 1997 by then president Elias Hrawi but only parts of the ground floor and basement were made accessible since the remainder of the building was still under repair and [...] important modifications were needed to meet the requirements of modern <b>museology</b> standards. The museum was again closed to the public in July 1998 to achieve restoration works. On October 8, 1999, the museum re-opened its doors to the public under the patronage of president Emile Lahoud.|$|E

2500|$|At {{that point}} in life, Tzigara was also pleased with the state and {{popularity}} of <b>museology</b> in Greater Romania; in 1937, he had claimed: [...] "all the country is presently a museum". His hostility to open-air museums was by then {{a thing of the}} past, since, it was argued, Greater Romania's peasant society seemed threatened by modern urbanization. In the late 1930s, this judgment prompted sociologist Dimitrie Gusti to create the National Village Museum, located a short distance away from Tzigara's own building site.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, {{he took a}} {{four-year}} job as head curator of the Municipal Museum in Subotica (Serbia – Vojvodina).

50|$|In {{the context}} of the 1960s, Stránský has {{appointed}} that there were objective reasons for the “birth of <b>museology</b> as a science”, however, its internal prerequisite, i.e., the logical structure, was inexistent. His question on the character of <b>museology,</b> then, made him think on the theoretical base of the very theory. In other words, Stránský has built a metatheoretical problematic as the starting point for structuring the scientific discipline, introducing the notion of metamuseology. The term designates “the theory whose subject is <b>museology</b> in itself”, in a certain way being strictly bound to <b>museology,</b> but also related to philosophy, to history and to the theory of science and culture.|$|E
