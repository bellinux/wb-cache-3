40|$|During {{the past}} fifty years, while observing {{the decline of}} the Gozo lace industry, nobody seemed to notice that the weak point lay in the absence of lace education. Lace making was {{regarded}} as a means of using up free time during the day in the role of unemployed females from which a little subsistence was gained to help the family income. When the industrial estate in Xewkija opened in the 1970 s providing jobs mainly for females, the lace industry took its fatal blow after having already suffered from the surge of mass emigration in the 1960 s. During the 1990 s, the then Minister of Gozo, <b>Mr</b> <b>Anton</b> Tabone was of the opinion that lace making should be taught on an academic level as a subject at the Gozo Campus because of its particular roots on this island. Mr Tabone also took the initiative to discuss the matter with the University authorities. As a result, in 1998 a Lacemaking Programme was setup. The aim of the Programme is to provide lace education to all strata of society, be they workers or merchants, male or female, young or old, to teach the craft, as well as lace design and ancillary studies including lace history. Traditional techniques are taught, as these are associated with Gozo’s identity, but modern approaches and design also form part of the teaching programme. peer-reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Around 1740, medieval city Schemnitz, Kingdom of Hungary (now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia) {{intended}} {{to form a}} standard Calvary with fourteen stations {{in the eastern part}} of the city - under a hill named Ostrý vrch (Scharffenberg - this hill along with the surrounding land belonged to the family of Fritz von Friedenlieb, of Protestant religion). However, only two chapels still remain standing. The Jesuit Father Francis Perger proposed to the City Hall a project of magnificent Calvary comprising three churches and 22 chapels, probably based on the architectural design of major historian, cartographer and architect Samuel Mikoviny.The owners of the land in the year 1744 released the top of the hill with its western slope to the city in order to allow implementation of the Calvary complex as proposed by the Father Perger.After considering, the magistrate finally on 13 March 1744 agreed to, and provided the initial funding by the sum of 300 Goldens. Municipality Banská Štiavnica presented on 22 May 1744 a demand to ecclesiastical authority for approval to build Calvary according to this project under the auspices of the city of Banská Štiavnica. Archbishop of Esztergom (resident in Trnava) Imrich Esterházy (1725-1745) adopted the request and his approval reached the municipality on 13 August 1744. Immediately prepariation work was begun - treatments of the ground and import of materials on the site. The cornerstone was solemnly blessed by the presence of large numbers of believers and the priesthood on the Feast of Exaltation of the holy Cross - on 14 September in 1744. The first building was the [...] "Upper Church".All works have been directed by the creator of the idea - the Jesuit Father Francis Perger S.J. Local masons, carpenters, stonemasons, woodcarvers worked there as well as painters and other professionals. The wooden reliefs from Calvary chapels and wood carvings from the Upper church are attributed to the workshop of Dionysius Stanetti (1710-1767), a major baroque sculptor, established in the city of Kremnica. The upper church has been painted by Austrian gothic painter <b>Mr.</b> <b>Anton</b> Schmidt, born and graduated in Vienna, settled in the city of Banská Štiavnica.Before completion of works, they started pilgrimages to the Calvary hill Banská Štiavnica. On 14 September 1745, the Upper Church has been solemnly blessed and the first holy Mass took place there, visited by pilgrims who came out of the city in a procession with flags. Also in 1746, on the Feast of the Finding and Exaltation of the holy Cross, processions came to Calvary. That year, they finished the Holy Sepulchre - chapel and the lower church of the calvary. Even after these years, in spite of continuing works of construction and equipment of churches and chapels, pilgrims came on 14 September, not only from Štiavnica, but also from the environment.On the Feast of the Holy Trinity in 1751, they visited the calvary prominent guests, among them the Emperor Francis of Lorraine.The whole Calvary complex of Banská Štiavnica was built and churches and chapels equipped in less than seven years. The ceremonial blessing took place on 13 September 1751.The festive mass was preached in the Germanic and Slovak languages, the Germanic sermon given by the popular father Francis Perger.|$|R
40|$|THE ORPHIC PAPYRUS ROLL OF THESSALONICA (Plates 12 - 15) In {{the course}} of an {{excavation}} of tombs conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service at Derveni, a site about 10 km. North of Thessalonica, in the first months of 1962, among the remnants of the funeral pyre of tomb A was found a carbonized Greek papyrus roll. This is the first manuscript on papyrus to have been discovered so far in the soil of the Greek metropolis as against the thousands of similar finds coming from Herculanum, Egypt or Palestine. Unfortunately the roll was not found intact. Only its upper part, 7 - 8 cm. high, had been preserved, the rest of it having apparently been destroyed by the fire. The impossible task of unrolling the extremely fragile object was carried out by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Anton</b> Fackelmann, conservator of the Vienna National Library collection of papyri, who finally succeeded, by using juice of fresh papyrus, in making the carbonized roll manageable. Thus the text became accessible for decipherment and further investigation. The importance of the new manuscript lies chiefly in its early date. A comparison of its writing with that of the oldest known papyri coming from the last decades of the IVth century (particularly that of the Timotheos papyrus), {{as well as with the}} inscriptions of the same century suggests that the new roll was written about the middle of the IVth century B. C. If this is true, as I firmly believe despite some doubts expressed by other scholars, this roll must be the oldest Greek manuscript now in existence. Moreover its neat appearance is significant in that it proves that by this time a real Buchschrift had been developed in Greece, whereas in Egypt even later Greek literary papyri were written in clumsy and rather crude hand (cf. W. Schubart, Einleitung in die Papyruskunde, Berlin 1918, p. 30). The unrolling gave only a series of small and large fragments and several tiny scraps. However the relation of most of these fragments between each other have now been established, and this has been partly feasible thanks to the young photographer Mr. Spyros Tsavdaroglou, who supplied us with excellent photographs. In this task as well as in the decipherment of the text, in many places obscure and desperately damaged, I largely profited by the palaeographic and scholarly experience of my assistant Mr. K. Tsantsanoglou. Twenty two columns can now be recognized with certainty. As the place of a few fragments and scraps has not yet been identified we cannot say how many columns the roll contained originally. The number of the lines preserved differs from column to column ranging from eleven to sixteen; but the last lines generally present large gaps. The number of lines contained in the lower part of the roll, now lost, cannot actually be reckoned. It should be noted that the continuation of the text in subsequent columns is very rarely obvious. The length of the lines varies between thirty one to forty two letters, the copyist finishing each line with a full word or, exceptionally, with the first component of a compound. The style of the script is the same throughout the text, but after the seventh column a finer calamos was employed. The text is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem of cosmogenic and theogenic content. Eighteen verses of this poem are quoted separately, marked by the sign of paragraphos, while other words or phrases are inserted in the text of the commentary itself. This poem, alluded to by Plato (Laws 713 e), was known from Ps. - Aristotle’s de Mundo 1 (401 a 25) and appears later on in an expanded form in the socalled Rhapsodic Theogony (ιεροί λόγοι εν ραψωδίαις κδ'). Since the time of the composition of the Orphic Theogony is uncertain, the new text will probably cast new light on this puzzling problem. Besides the Orphic verses the commentator quotes three Homeric verses (also instructive for the tradition of the Homeric text) in order to corroborate his explanation of a word of the poem commented on by him. For it is a feature of this author’s method to combine allegoric interpretation with lexical explanations. However this method of lexical explanation and quotation of verses does not prove that this commentary is in any way connected with Alexandrian scholarship. Even if the date of the new roll permitted such a hypothesis, the fact that here the main point is the allegoric interpretation, which was alien to Alexandrian scholarship, excludes any connection with the latter. Here another tradition, that of allegoric interpretation of poetry, which appears already in the Vlth century, is in operation. There is evidence that allegoric interpreters pursued lexical explanation (an example is offered by Metrodoros from Lampsacus). The language of this text, which contains poetic and Ionic forms, makes it probable that the commentator of the Orphic poem, like other allegorists, did not come from Athens but from the periphery of the Greek world. Yet nothing is certain about his identity. Epigenes who is stated to have written On Orpheus' Poetry (Clem. Al. Strom. I 21, 131, 5 = II 81, 11 St.) and explained the expressions of Orphic symbolism [ibid. V 8, 49, 3 = 360, 10 St.), though seemingly not unfamiliar with lexical explanation (cf. Athen. 468 c) should be excluded since the allegoric explanations of this commentary are quite different from his own...|$|R
40|$|Three {{main reasons}} {{convinced}} {{me of the}} need to write this book, and I am glad that my colleagues on the Attard Local Council were of the same mind and entrusted me with the task. My first immersion into Attard's history was provoked by the mistaken exclusion ofSant'Anton, the palace and gardens, from its historic confines, when local council boundaries were first drawn out by the central government authorities. That offended every acclimatised resident of Attard, as well as my own childhood memories, when going to Attard from Floriana meant a frolic and a picnic, feeding the swans and watching monkey acrobatics. Another hiccup had been the exclusion of a red quadrant from Attard's traditional coat-of-arms by a heraldic expert not conversant with the simmering strengths of local history. Both these inadvertant errors were later rectified, but not before or without a sustained engagement in battle, armed by the pen of course, not the sword. Another instigation to get started on at least a modest pioneering work of this kind came from the constant quizzing I was having to put up with about Attard from several new colleagues and friends at the Council of Europe as well as professional contacts I was beginning to make in other countries when on mission. Having headed Malta's Delegation to the Strasbourg-based Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe since its inception in 1994, I became much involved in this sphere of activity nationally and internationally. But what the Council of Europe always recognises and emphasises above all is the local provenance and the electoral base of members of the European Congress. In participation lists, speeches and reports I therefore invariably carried behind me, like a tail, the tag: "Mayor of Attard". Those who hardly knew where Malta was knew still less about Attard, but even among those who had come to Malta they would mostly remember the seaside tourist resorts or the casino, Valletta or perhaps Mdina, rather than a place like Attard, unless they happened to have stayed at the Corinthia Palace Hotel or been stopped by their tour coach at Sant'Anton for a walk-about in the gardens. Almost without exception, there was never a profile of the place or its inhabitants in their memories of Malta. While I was often presented with books or booklets by other Mayors or Councillors about their respective municipalities, I was never in a position to reciprocate such a gesture, nor of course could any of my Council colleagues if faced by a similar situation. The third and perhaps gravest reason for this little book however was the difficulty which many residents have had to identify the areas which made up Attard or to know where many of the streets themselves were located or what they were called. Often enough, for example, they would be unaware of the different areas that made up the place, and altogether unfamiliar with the names of the streets. Naturally my own work commitment {{in the context of the}} Local Council was itself an enriching experience on a human, operational and indeed an historical level. I too was on a learning curve, so I felt increasingly obliged and propelled to share that growth with fellow residents and citizens, but also to help Attard get out of its shell and be better known and appreciated, as it well deserved to be. In compiling data for this book I have relied on the generous assistance of so many people, mostly Attard residents. Too many to mention here, but I must at least list alphabetically all those who have kindly agreed to submit written notes, articles or pamphlets, or respond to queries of one kind or another.

I am specifically grateful, for their local knowledge and contacts, to the Deputy Mayor, Mr. Gerald Borg, and to Councillor Joseph Mifsud, both of whom were born and raised in Attard. In thanking all the Council's members of staff I must reserve a special thank you for another 'native child of the village', our clerk Ms Marica Mifsud, who also typed in many additions and corrections to my draft texts.
