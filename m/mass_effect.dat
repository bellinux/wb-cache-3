5|$|At Gamescom 2010, BioWare {{announced}} that a PlayStation 3 version of the game was in development. Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's exclusivity, the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console {{to play the game}} due to the game's compatibility with the original <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect,</b> which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time. The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011 in North America and January 21, 2011 in Europe. Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, which span two DVDs, the PlayStation 3 version of <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 fits on one Blu-ray Disc. The downloadable PlayStation Network version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3. As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> and <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 combined have sold more than seven million units worldwide. In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> Trilogy, was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. In 2016, <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{characters}} in the trilogy, Tali has been subject to various merchandise. DC Direct included Tali their first line of <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 squadmate figures, first revealed in January 2010 and then released in April 2011. A second figure was announced during Comic-Con 2012, as part of Square Enix's second line of Play Arts Kai <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> figures (along with the female Shepard). BioWare also officially endorsed an originally fan-made plushie of the character, selling it on their online store. Dark Horse's <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> playing cards feature Tali as the Queen of Hearts, alongside other <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 characters in other roles.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game publications and {{sold more than}} {{one and a half}} million copies by January 2008. Critics praised the game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design, but criticized its unbalanced combat mechanics and poor artificial intelligence. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards. <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> was ported to the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms in 2008 and 2012, respectively. A sequel, <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2, was released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> {{was planned}} {{as the first}} chapter of a trilogy, {{development}} of a sequel began shortly before the game was released. The sequel, entitled <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2, was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, and for PlayStation 3 on January 18, 2011. With the import of a completed saved game of the original <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect,</b> the player can impact the story of <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 in numerous ways.

5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> Trilogy compilation.

First, we establish state-of-the-art simulations with up to two jets to next-to-leading order including top <b>mass</b> <b>effects.</b> They allow us to search for deviations from the low-energy limits in boosted Higgs production. In addition, the size of the top <b>mass</b> <b>effects</b> suggests that they should generally be included in Higgs studies at the LHC. Next, we show how off-shell Higgs production with a decay to four leptons is sensitive to the same top <b>mass</b> <b>effects.</b> We compare the potential of both methods based on the same top-Higgs Lagrangian.

5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller.

The player may choose to import a character from a completed saved game of the original <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> or start the game with a new character. Importing an old character allows several decisions the player made in the original game to impact the story of <b>Mass</b> <b>Effect</b> 2 and grants the player a set of starting bonuses. The game features six different character classes for the player to choose from. Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types. For example, the Vanguard class is specialized in close-range combat and shotguns, while the Infiltrator class relies on stealth combat and the use of sniper rifles.|$|E

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of many plant species competing {{for a few}} resources {{is one of the}} central puzzles of community ecology. One explanation is that different species may be competitively superior in different microhabitats. Many species could then coexist within each piece of a mosaic landscape by what has been termed "mass effects," because subpopulations in areas with negative growth rates would be supplemented by propagules from areas with reproductive surpluses. If <b>mass</b> <b>effects</b> are important, plant species diversity should increase near habitat boundaries, especially where habitat differences are moderate. In the first experimental test of this prediction, plants were censused on 54 transects within the long-established Rothamsted Park Grass plots. Very few showed significant declines in species richness with distance from subplot boundaries. Nonetheless, the regression coefficients were negative much more often than expected by chance, suggesting that weak <b>mass</b> <b>effects</b> operated. The effect was strongest where neighboring subplots differed greatly, with no evidence of the predicted decline where differences were extreme. Detailed analyses of transects with apparent <b>mass</b> <b>effects</b> revealed few species that behaved as predicted. This study serves both to provide evidence of the existence of <b>mass</b> <b>effects</b> and to question their importance in the maintenance of local plant diversity in this system. ...|$|R
