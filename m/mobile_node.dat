Each <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> is identified by its home address disregarding its current {{location in the}} Internet.

5000|$|From {{the patent}} Accordingly, {{it is an}} object of the present {{invention}} to provide a mechanism for selecting the optimal bearer for each data packet in varying situations. The object is achieved by a method and equipment which are characterized by what is disclosed in the attached independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the attached dependent claims. The invention {{is based on the}} idea that selecting the optimal bearer for a data packet between the MBN and the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> is based on a combination of 1) the quality-of-service requirement (traffic class) of the data packet in question, 2) the mobility data related to the <b>mobile</b> <b>node,</b> 3) the traffic data related to the multiple bearers, and 4) bearer preference information. The bearer preference information can be obtained from the <b>mobile</b> <b>node,</b> and optionally, from the operators of the home and visited MBN operators.In order to save the battery of a portable <b>mobile</b> <b>node,</b> it is preferable that the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> only monitors one bearer type (network) at a time. For example, the subscriber data related to the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> can include a default bearer type, such as GSM or UMTS. The <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> should be paged on this bearer. The <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> can be ordered to monitor the selected bearer type by sending a modified page message which indicates the selected bearer type, channel, possible decryption data, etc. Alternatively, such information can be sent in a separate message, such as a short message, USSD, (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), data call or the like. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, as long as the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> is within a certain coverage area, all IP packets belonging to the same session (or flow if flow labels are used) are routed via the same interface unit. For example, if a <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> is receiving IP packets from a DAB network, via a cell x, all IP packets of the same session should be routed via DAB cell x, unless the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> moves out of the coverage area of this cell.|$|E

50|$|A node {{wanting to}} {{communicate}} with the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> uses the permanent home address of the <b>mobile</b> <b>node</b> as the destination address to send packets to. Because the home address logically belongs to the network associated with the home agent, normal IP routing mechanisms forward these packets to the home agent. Instead of forwarding these packets to a destination that is physically in the same network as the home agent, the home agent redirects these packets towards the remote address through an IP tunnel by encapsulating the datagram with a new IP header using the care of address of the <b>mobile</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{thesis is}} to reduce the data traffic from mobile network by {{exploiting}} Ad-hoc modes of communication. This can be achieved by sending message to few <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> which will forward data to rest of the <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> via Ad-hoc communication. This thesis focuses on selection of those few <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> (Target Set) which will receive message directly from mobile network and can effectively reduce the data traffic on mobile network by forwarding that message to many other <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> via Ad-hoc communication. Thesis consists of two tasks. First task of thesis is to implement the concept of Mobile Traffic Offloading on android based smart phones using desktop as server and two smart phones as its clients. Second task of the thesis is to implement the same concept on a large scale with more scope for Target Set selection. Second task consists of five different approaches for the selection of Target Set of mobile. First approach is Random approach, in this approach server sends message to a randomly selected Target Set of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> from all available <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> Second and third approaches are Distance and Distance Extended. These approaches considers the euclidean distance between each pair of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> Distance approach considers the current euclidean distance and checks the possibility of Ad-hoc communication. Distance Extended approach uses the current distance between the <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> and also calculates the probabilistic future distance between <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> Fourth approach is Same Street, this approach considers the position of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> on the street map and uses that position to find Target Set of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> Final approach of thesis is Path Length approach. This approach also is a map based approach and finds shortest distance between each pair of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> This approach also considers the probability of Ad-hoc communication in future. Finally this thesis presents the evaluation for both tasks. Evaluation of first task shows that how message delay changes with increase in message size. Evaluation of second task compares all Target Set selection approaches on the basis of number of Ad-hoc messages, Message Delay and Energy Consumption.

40|$|Abstract: As a {{new type}} of {{wireless}} mobile networks, Ad Hoc networks do not depend on any fixed infrastructure, and have no centralized control unit and so its computation capabilities are limited by <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> In this paper, a novel multi-party key agreement scheme with password authentication and sharing password evolvement for Ad Hoc networks is proposed based on ECC (elliptic curves cryptography). One of the functions of passwords is used as sharing information to authenticate the <b>mobile</b> <b>node’s</b> secret keys, and the other is used as a symmetrical key to encrypt alternating information between <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> The freshness and security of passwords are guaranteed by sharing password evolvement every time in <b>mobile</b> <b>node’s</b> secret keys authentication and key agreement. Consequently, the computational overheads and the store load of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> are lessened, moreover, secret keys authentication and information encryption between <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> are provided.

30|$|According to the {{mobility}} {{property of the}} node, the coverage problem that is an important topic in the wireless sensor network {{can be divided into}} two classes: static <b>nodes</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> [10, 11]. Therefore, according to the constitution of nodes, WSN can be divided into two types: static and mobile. A hybrid WSN can be established by mixing the static and <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> in the same WSN. The static sensor network refers to the network composed of only static nodes. Its cost is low. But the static nodes have many limitations and cannot meet the requirement of actual application. The mobile sensor network is composed of only <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> and has good mobility. However, the <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> usually undertake more tasks than static ones and are equipped with special mobility modules. Thus, the components of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> are much stronger than static ones. Big size and high cost make it less possible to apply in the real situation. The hybrid sensor network is constituted of both static and <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> Its advantages include low cost, good mobility, and the most frequent application.|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in wireless networking {{and the consequent}} emergence of new applications that wireless networks increasingly support inevitably leads to low capability <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> connecting to peer-to-peer networks. However, the characteristics of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> and limitations of access point coverage often cause <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> to lose connectivity, which can cause many <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> to simultaneously rejoin the network. Continuous departures and joins due to the mobility of nodes leads to mobility churn, which can often degrade {{the performance of the}} underlying peer-topeer network significantly. In this paper, we use simulations to demonstrate that the Stealth Distributed Hash Table (Stealth DHT) algorithm is ideally suited for networks with <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes.</b> By avoiding storing state in unreliable nodes, a Stealth DHT prevents <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> from being used by other nodes to provide services. Consequently, Stealth DHTs eliminate the mobility churn effect and significantly reduce the amount of overhead as compared to a generic DHT.

30|$|Performance gain {{achieved}} by adding <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> to a stationary sensor network for target detection depends on {{factors such as}} the number of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> deployed, mobility patterns, speed and energy constraints of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{and the nature of the}} target locations (deterministic or random). In this paper, we address the problem of distributed detection of a randomly located target by a hybrid sensor network. Specifically, we develop two decision-fusion architectures for detection where in the first one, impact of node mobility is taken into account for decisions updating at the fusion center, while in the second model the impact of node mobility is taken at the node level decision updating. The cost of deploying <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> is analyzed in terms of the minimum fraction of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> required to achieve the desired performance level within a desired delay constraint. Moreover, we consider managing node mobility under given constraints.|$|R
30|$|Since {{deploying}} <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> {{for continuous}} performance (coverage, detection, and tracking) improvement {{might not be}} as cost-effective as deploying static nodes, it is useful to consider networks consisting of both static and <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> where the <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> are allowed to move only if necessary. The target tracking performance of an integrated mobile-static sensor network was addressed in [18]. In [18], the <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> are used to aid the data propagation when the communication ranges of static nodes are limited. The target detection in a hybrid sensor network is addressed by [19, 20] where they have proposed a two-phase detection model for target detection assuming known target locations. Although we address a similar problem, our work is different from [19, 20] in several contexts. (i) In this paper we explicitly present two decision-fusion models for target detection when the target location is random. (ii) We consider constrained mobility for <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> where each node can move only in a predetermined set of candidate directions from their current locations. (iii) We evaluate the cost of deploying <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> in terms of the minimum fraction of <b>mobile</b> <b>nodes</b> that should be directed to move to achieve a desired performance level within a desired delay constraint, analytically. Moreover, [19, 20] did not allow for the possibility of imperfect communication links between nodes and the fusion center.|$|R
