5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of Covent Garden, with Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> running north-east from St Martin's Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a {{mountain}} named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E

5|$|Mamucium was {{levelled}} as Manchester {{expanded in}} the Industrial Revolution. The {{construction of the}} Rochdale Canal through the south western corner of the fort in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the building of viaducts for the Great Northern Railway over the site in the late 19th century, damaged the remains and even destroyed some of the southern half of the fort. When the railway viaducts were built, Charles Roeder documented the remains that were uncovered in the process, including parts of the vicus. Mills were all around the site. Castlefield became the south west corner of Manchester city centre. Deansgate, which developed into the <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester.|$|E
5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 {{acts as the}} <b>main</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> {{once again}} turning along {{different}} local roads.

Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just a block or so from the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E
