5|$|Claire {{appeared}} in George A. Romero's Japanese TV commercial for Resident Evil 2 {{and in a}} viral marketing video to promote Resident Evil 5 (despite her not appearing in actual game). Several action figures of Claire were released by various manufacturers, including one by Toy Biz in 1998, {{as well as two}} by <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick</b> Toys, two by Palisades Toys, and one by Volks in 2001. A Claire block-style figure was also released by Dragon in the Kubrick's Resident Evil line, while Vanilla Chop produced a resin kit. One of costumes for the character C. Viper in the fighting game Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was inspired by Claire's iconic look in Resident Evil 2.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick.</b> These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|Khan lures Enterprise to {{the space}} station Regula I, and he {{launches}} a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is severely wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick</b> as he watches Enterprise try to escape.|$|E

5|$|Nemesis {{appears on}} the cover of every version of Resident Evil 3, and is {{mentioned}} prominently on flyers for Resident Evil: Survivor 2. Capcom has also released commercial products modeled on the character, such as an adult size Halloween mask, and later a silver ring modeled after Nemesis's head available for purchase through their Japanese online store. Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable rocket launcher) and a mini bust, which were released alongside several other Resident Evil-based merchandise. <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick</b> released its own line of Resident Evil action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy. Included in the series were Nemesis's first and second form, with the first form featuring an alternate head and equipable rocket launcher. Each set additionally includes a part of an action figure of Nemesis's third form, which measures 24inches (60cm) long when completed.|$|E
5|$|Once relentlessly {{hunted for}} their products, whales are now {{protected}} by international law. Some species are attributed {{with high levels}} of intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as non-human persons. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and are considered functionally extinct by cetologists. The baiji is also considered functionally extinct by the IUCN with, the last sighting in 2004. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick.</b> Small cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor. Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.|$|E

Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic.

50|$|Many {{exterior}} scenes set in New Bedford {{were shot}} {{on location in}} Youghal, Co. Cork, Ireland. The town has a public house, originally called Linehan's {{and at that time}} owned by Paddy Linehan, whose exterior appears in the movie. It was renamed <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick's</b> shortly after filming by Mr. Linehan. It is still owned and run by the Linehan family and boasts a fine collection of photographs taken of the cast and crew during the making of the film. While there, John Huston used the bar as his headquarters to plan each day's filming. The town's harbor basin, in front of <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick's</b> bar, was used to stand in as New Bedford's harbor, and some local people appear as extras in the ship's departure scene. Youghal's nineteenth century lighthouse also appears in a scene of the Pequod putting to sea (at sunset) on her fateful voyage.|$|R

25|$|American writer Herman Melville was {{inspired}} by the account of the Essex, and used some facts from the story, as well as his own eighteen-month experience as a sailor aboard a commercial whaler, to write his epic 1851 novel on the oil whaling industry, <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick.</b> The sections in <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick</b> on the biology of the sperm whale were largely based on books by Thomas Beale (1839) and Frederick Bennett (1840).|$|E

This `wooden leg´, actually carved out of whalebone, allowed him to walk with minimal difficulty. The loss of this leg would fuel Ahab's obsession with <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick,</b> which cost him his ship, crew, and his life.|$|E

Even as he became older and gave up coaching and refereeing, he still taught hundreds of greater Boston hockey players, including future Olympics Dave Silk and Jackie O'Callahan, at numerous hockey schools. And yes, even as he got older, he still kept playing hockey for local teams such as the <b>Moby</b> <b>Dicks,</b> which won the 65-years-and-older Snoopy Tournament in Santa Rosa, California.

50|$|After 1950, as {{the rest}} of {{downtown}} gentrified, especially as the part of the Gateway District east of Hennepin was demolished and replaced with modern structures and parking lots, lower Hennepin Avenue became known as a place for drunks, crime, and prostitution. Block E {{was the center of the}} squalor. The 620 Club in 1971 gave way to <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick's,</b> and became known as one of the city's most seedy bars. Unsavory establishments, including rough bars, flophouses, and an adult movie theater settled in on Block E in the 1970s and 1980s. The opposite side of Hennepin deteriorated during this period as well, with the Aster and Gopher Theaters — screens that showed mainstream fare — switching to adult films. Block E's Hennepin face was anchored at each end by a Shinder's news vendor; Shinder's began at the 6th Street corner in 1916 and later split into two companies, framing the block as bookends might at opposite corners.|$|R
50|$|Having the {{grandson}} of Leo Tolstoy {{involved in the project}} helped Marineland become a very fashionable destination in its early days, prompting writers Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, John Dos Passos, and Ernest Hemingway to visit <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick's</b> Bar located there. Ms. Rawlings was married to Norton Baskin who at one time (1950s/early 1960s) was the operator/manager of the Dolphin Restaurant/Moby Dick Lounge. The park's facilities were very popular with tourists and also used for numerous movies, including Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and Revenge of the Creature (1955). Trained dolphins became an additional attraction in the early 1950s as Marineland became one of Florida's major attractions, attracting over 900,000 visitors per year with peak attendance in the mid-1970s. The opening of Walt Disney World Resort in 1971 gave a major boost to the attraction's annual attendance. However, Sea World's entry into the Florida market eventually had a very negative impact on Marineland from the late 1970s through the 2009. Many publications erroneously note the peak attendance as having been 300,000. The break-even admission point was actually 400,000, however, even during the 1950s.|$|R

25|$|Moby Dick—Rehearsed: a {{film version}} of Welles's 1955 London meta-play, {{starring}} Gordon Jackson, Christopher Lee, Patrick McGoohan, and with Welles as Ahab. Using bare, minimalist sets, Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth-century actors rehearsing a production of <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick,</b> with scenes from <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick</b> itself. Kenneth Williams, a cast member who was apprehensive about the entire project, recorded in his autobiography that Welles's dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable. The entire play was filmed, but is now presumed lost. This was made during one weekend at the Hackney Empire theatre.|$|E

60|$|In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, {{the white}} birds were now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when {{within a few}} yards began {{fluttering}} over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot {{no bigger than a}} white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It was <b>Moby</b> <b>Dick's</b> open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.|$|R
500|$|Khan's {{pursuit of}} Kirk {{is central to}} the film's theme of vengeance, and The Wrath of Khan {{deliberately}} borrows heavily from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. To make the parallels clear to viewers, Meyer added a visible copy of Moby-Dick to Khan's dwelling. Khan liberally paraphrases Ahab, with [...] "I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up!". Khan also quotes Ahab's tirade {{at the end of the}} novel verbatim with his final lines: [...] "to the last I grapple with thee; from Hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." [...] Kirk represents both the restless elements of Ishmael as well as the titular white whale of Melville's novel; Khan's blind pursuit of Kirk mirrors Captain Ahab's obsession with Moby-Dick. Both Khan and Ahab pursue their quarry against the better judgment of their crew, and end up killing themselves in an effort to take their foe with them.
