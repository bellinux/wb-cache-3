During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160°E and 180° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between the 180° and the American coast. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period during the season, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period.|$|E

Antecedents of performance studied were: trust in team members, trust in supervisors, <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> team members and <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> supervisors. Heedful interrelating, a concept developed by Weick and Roberts (1993) {{was expected to}} mediate between trust in team members, <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> team members and team performance. Correlation analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to analyse the data. The results show that heedful interrelating of team members, built {{on a combination of}} trust and <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> team members and trust in supervisors {{is an important factor in}} promoting team performance...|$|R

5|$|The South Pacific Basin, {{as defined}} by the World Meteorological Organization, is split into two sub-areas, <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> {{separate}} agencies.

Those that move south of 25°S are <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. At the start of the season, a new naming policy was introduced by the Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South- East Indian Ocean. The policy stated that a storm attaining gale-force winds in only one quadrant near its center would be named by the Fiji Meteorological Service. This is in contrast to the previous policy in which gale-force winds had to completely surround the center to be named.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the central Pacific, John left the area <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> the NHC and was instead <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably {{in an increasingly}} favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on 22 August John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.|$|E

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion).
