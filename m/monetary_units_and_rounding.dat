40|$|<b>Monetary</b> <b>unit</b> {{is a basic}} {{element of}} {{accounting}} used to manage, report, govern and tax organizations in all sectors of the economy.

We model the impact of monetary instability on the accuracy of accounting valuation and consequently on the economics of managing organizations.

When the real value of money becomes uncertain or unstable, the rationale for keeping accounts in units of money fades. In a monetized and commercialized society, rates of exchange between most resources and money are available. Such opportunities for exchange yield estimates of opportunity costs of the resources. In such environments, it is possible to easily, transparently, and usefully represent bundles of disparate resources in terms of money (see Vatter, 1971, pp. 4 - 5). Consequently most accounting is done in units of money (see Dobija and Sliwa, 2001, for a history). Many a [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Cost-benefit {{analysis}} (CBA) estimates {{a benefit}} attained via monetary values, {{but can also}} incorporate non-monetary values. CBA {{has been criticized for}} being limited in democratic (Söderbaum 2015) and ethical (Hall 2015) considerations. Hall (2015) has considered CBA suitable for its practical benefits, given that it is based on <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> <b>and</b> the possibility for it being used together with other approaches. CBA works well in assessing monetary values, which is its strengths since economic evaluation as such is objective-oriented and suitable for policy-making cases. Criticism related to the CBA approach has emerged due to the challenges in monetizing all inputs and outputs and/or outcomes. In a forestry context, recreation, non-wood goods and scenic beauty are examples of values difficult to evaluate in economic terms. Therefore, supplementary methods may be needed for incorporating values for intangible and non-monetary factors in CBA (Prokofieva et al. 2011). If non-monetary values are incorporated in CBA, it may also be considered a multi-criteria analysis (MCA, introduced below) tool.|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} uncertainties of total CO 2 emission intensities estimated using an input-output (I-O) table for a life-cycle inventory analysis. The validity of the total CO 2 emission intensities has been questioned mainly because the amounts of commodities are measured in <b>monetary</b> <b>units,</b> <b>and</b> because various commodities are produced in a single sector of an existing I-O table. In this study, first, a sensitivity analysis of total CO 2 emission intensities estimated using the Japanese I-O table was performed to identify the elements that significantly influence the total CO 2 emission intensity. If an influential element identified by sensitivity analysis varies widely, the total CO 2 emission intensity is greatly influenced. Secondly, how much total CO 2 emission intensities vary associated with the variation of those influential elements was evaluated. It was concluded that the evaluation of uncertainties using a stochastic approach {{as well as the}} improvement of accuracy by disaggregating the original I-O sectors, focusing on influential elements, are important. ...|$|R

At {{the end of the}} period 1989 – 2011, the annual net investment in agriculture was about 6 times lower and fixed capitalization about 4 times higher compared to 1989. In the same period, GVA in agriculture experienced a strong relative decline as share in national economy (from 23. 7 % (1990) to 6. 4 % (2010)); however, agriculture maintained its “social buffer” role throughout the investigated period, as this sector still uses a large labour input, yet poorly remunerated and with a deficient endowment in production factors that could contribute to increased yields. Using data from the national accounts, the input- output tables and the Chennery - Watanabe and Rasmussen method, it resulted that the Romanian agri-food sector simultaneously presents a double hypostasis: client, through backward linkages and supplier, through forward linkages for the remaining branches, their cumulative economic driving effects (upstream + downstream) being about 4. 8 <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> <b>and</b> 4. 7 <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> respectively...|$|R

To cope with different <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> <b>and</b> different supports of the income distributions involved, we utilized their transformations to population and income quantiles.
