Early programmers included a Czech programmer Yan Boda. In 1987 a venture capital company was set up, named Value Added Information Medical Products Ltd (VAMP) to recruit other practices and form an information base. The early development team of three, Marcella Devenish (formerly a midwife), Philip Lee-Warren (formerly a Senior Medical Laboratory Scientific Officer), {{under the leadership of}} Kieran O'Mally, developed further the computerised system using the BOS <b>Microcobol</b> development environment. During this period the number of UK practices using the software product IGP (Integrated General Practice) expanded from a few hundred to over two and a half thousand.|$|E
