5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses.

5|$|After Juan Ponce de León {{began the}} {{colonization}} process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became a strategic military location, used by Spain {{to protect its}} colonies and possessions in America. Vessels {{used it as a}} main point for resupplying before attempting long voyages and trading became a key part of economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a <b>monetary</b> <b>support</b> decree to the archipelago known as situado, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico. However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.|$|E

When the news leaked to the leaders of other needle trade unions, President Green was forced to publicly reiterate the AFL's support for the non-communist union. But the new flow of funds and staff did nothing to resuscitate the Joint Council. Worse, from the AFL's perspective, the Joint Board then called several strikes in July 1928 and won major wage increases from the employers.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to deploy}} French troops during the blockade, France {{promoted}} civil wars against Rosas {{to support the}} naval actions. For this purpose France aided Fructuoso Rivera against the Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, who was forced to resign. Oribe escaped to Buenos Aires, and Rosas received him as the legitimate president of Uruguay, denying such recognition to Rivera. This started the Uruguayan Civil War, where the Blancos sought to restore Oribe in power and the Colorados to keep Rivera. As Rivera was hesitant to attack Rosas as the French expected, the Argentine expatriate Juan Lavalle was convinced to do so, but his army bolstered by French troops was nevertheless weakened by desertions and hostility from the local population on their march to Buenos Aires, and French <b>monetary</b> <b>support</b> was curtailed, as France conducted negotiated peace with Rosas by that time.
