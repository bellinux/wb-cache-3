5|$|Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{basidiomycete}} {{that forms}} symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections {{have been made}} under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only {{within the range of}} <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine.</b> All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, {{it is one of the}} few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada and on Santa Cruz Island.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} feeding area. There, cockatoos also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus radiata) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include Erodium species, doublegee (Emex australis) seeds, {{the fruit of the}} umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla), seeds of liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), onion grass (Romulea rosea), white cedar (Melia azedarach), and hibiscus flowers.|$|E

5000|$|San Francisco was {{originally}} mostly sand dunes and has few native trees. Fog, wind, cold, and salty air {{made it difficult}} for native and planted trees to survive. Only buckeye and Pacific willow were common. Most of the 90,000 trees in the city were planted in the 1880s through 1920s as part of large parks and properties. <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines</b> and Eucalyptus trees were planted in the San Francisco Presidio, Stern Grove, and Golden Gate Park. [...] However, these <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines</b> have been affected by pitch pine canker and have been dying.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the trees}} have died or {{are in the process}} of dying from the pine pitch canker, an {{introduced}} fungal disease, also threatening the <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pine's</b> remnant native groves in Cambria and the Monterey Peninsula.|$|R
5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, {{but not with the}} various coastal pine species, such as <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine.</b> In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus can {{be found}} all over the Northern Hemisphere. Native to Eurasia, it is {{widespread}} across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in Dashkin {{in the district of}} Astore, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe. It is very commonly found in <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus radiata) plantations, despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the northeast, the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States. According to Ernst Both, it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris. DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000mm (40in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as the Darling Downs and southern Queensland, and occasionally in Tasmania. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or fairy rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{stone pine}} (Pinus pinea), {{possibly}} the most characteristic of all, occupies sandy soils. It grows extensively both in the sandy areas of the lowlands in the provinces of Cádiz and Huelva, as well as points further inland (Valladolid, Cuenca, and Madrid). Finally, especial mention is necessary of the <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus radiata), because of its importance in reforestation and managed forests.|$|E
50|$|The main native {{tree species}} of this biome are beeches and oaks. In {{the second half}} of the 20th century, in some areas (especially in coastal areas), native forests were {{replaced}} by plantations of eucalyptus and <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines</b> for its commercial exploitation in the paper industry.|$|R

40|$|With {{the option}} of playing two PGA "championship" golf courses for nearly the same price as the local MWR golf course, service members are {{questioning}} the value of <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines</b> Golf Course, the government-operated course in the Monterey area. The main purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} costs and benefits of having a government-operated course in Monterey, where the golf market is extremely competitive, and to examine alternatives to improve the course in terms of value and quality to the service member The research conducted first focused on gathering information through a questionnaire survey about the current state of <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines,</b> from the eyes of the customer who plays the course. Research then focused on collecting and comparing operating and financial data from <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pines</b> with similar data from Bayonet and Black Horse Golf Courses. Finally, the study moved to examining {{the costs and benefits of}} three approaches to improving the course [...] one of which was a joint public/ private venture similar to Bayonet and Black Horse in structure. In conclusion, it was found that the course needs improvement or it will continue to face losing its military customer base. The three alternatives for improvement were all determined feasible, but strategic considerations of Monterey Pines' long- term market position will be necessary to make a final decision on improvements[URL] Navy (U.

25|$|After {{the wave}} of extinctions and range contractions caused {{by the arrival of}} mammals in New Zealand, the New Zealand wrens have a much reduced range. The New Zealand rock wren is now {{restricted}} to the South Island and is declining in numbers. The range of the rifleman initially contracted with the felling of forests for agriculture, but it has also expanded its range of habitats by moving into plantations of introduced exotic pines, principally the <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine.</b> It also enters other human-modified habitat when it adjoins native forest.|$|E
500|$|The conifer plantings and oak avenues along Main and Lower Drives {{were well}} {{established}} {{and of a}} mature size by the 1940s. Conifers were widely planted from the 1860s along with Moreton Bay figs and occasionally oaks. Oaks and elms were more widely planted from the 1880s. It is not known if Linaker {{was responsible for the}} oak avenues, but it appears that many of the conifers, Monterey pines, Canary Island pines, Monterey cypress, hoop pine, Bunya Bunya pines and Himalayan cedars, predate Linaker and the oaks and elms may have been planted soon after his appointment. The use of Bhutan cypress in the landscape is almost certainly due to Linaker as he favoured upright trees. It is possible that the two remnant Monterey cypress along Main Drive and a <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> along Lower Drive are trees from an earlier planting scheme. [...] Several trees and plants on the grounds of Kew Asylum and Kew Cottages have been classified as of historical significance by the Victorian Heritage Council and the National Trust of Australia (Victoria), and have been protected during the property's redevelopment.|$|E
500|$|Psilocybe makarorae {{closely resembles}} the North American species P.caerulipes, but the former can be {{distinguished}} microscopically from the latter {{by the presence of}} pleurocystidia, and cheilocystidia with longer necks. There are several other psychoactive species of Psilocybe found in New Zealand: P.aucklandii, P.cubensis, P.semilanceata, P.subaeruginosa, P.subcubensis, and P.tasmaniana. P.subaeruginosa is distinguished from P.makarorae by having chocolate brown pleurocystidia. Closely related to P.subaeruginosa is the poorly known P.tasmaniana; some have considered the two species synonymous. It has been reported growing on dung and dung-enriched woody debris in open areas of Eucalyptus forests. P.cubensis is a common, dung-loving species that can be readily recognized by its larger size (cap diameter up to [...] ), golden color, and well-formed membranous ring; P.subcubensis is nearly identical, differing only in microscopic characteristics. Known only from the Auckland region, P.auklandii fruits in soil rich in woody debris near Leptospermum and Dacrydium, and in <b>Monterey</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus radiata) plantations. P.semilanceata, {{one of the most common}} Psilocybe mushrooms, is only found in high-altitude grasslands on the South Island.|$|E

Rare plants also inhabit the chaparral: Hickman's onion, Yadon's piperia (Piperia yadonii) and Sandmat manzanita. Other rare plants in Monterey include Hutchinson's delphinium, Tidestrom lupine, Gardner's yampah and Monterey Knotweed, the latter perhaps already extinct.|$|E
2500|$|The Monterey Peninsula, {{discovery}} site of Potentilla hickmanii is in {{a native}} grassland opening within the <b>Monterey</b> <b>pine</b> forest. [...] The Monterey Peninsula {{is influenced by}} a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey submarine canyon. Rainfall is 40 to 50 centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for plants that would otherwise {{not be able to}} persist with such low precipitation. Some taxa, such as the coastal closed-cone pines and cypresses are relict stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the mesic climate of the late Pleistocene period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early Holocene period between 6000 and 2000 BC.|$|E
