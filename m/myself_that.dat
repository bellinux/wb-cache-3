5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E

25|$|I {{used to say}} to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{happiness}} and misery depend on ourselves. If you feel unhappy, raise your self above unhappiness, and so act that your happiness may be independent of all eventualities.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of December 2, 1859, Brown wrote:I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> without very much bloodshed it might be done.|$|E
25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The proper time's no time, sir,' {{repeated}} John Willet; 'when I {{was your}} age I never talked, I never wanted to talk. I listened and improved <b>myself</b> <b>that's</b> what I did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear no!' cried Tom, who had {{forgotten}} the blotted scrap of paper in his hand, until this inquiry brought it to his recollection. '"A respectable young man, aged thirty-five"--The beginning of a description of <b>myself.</b> <b>That's</b> all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{because they}} suffer. Those who suffer are like me--I pity <b>myself,</b> <b>that's</b> all; I am {{different}} from your Englishwomen. I see what I am doing; I {{do not let}} my mind become a turnip just because I am no longer moral." ...|$|R
25|$|Colonel Lee and John Stuart {{searched the}} {{surrounding}} country for fugitives who {{had participated in}} the attack. Few of Brown's associates escaped, and among those who did, some were sheltered by abolitionists in the north, including William Still. Brown was taken to the court house in nearby Charles Town for trial. He was found guilty of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia and was hanged on December 2. (This execution was witnessed by the actor John Wilkes Booth, who would later assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.) On the day of his execution, Brown wrote his last testament, which said,'I John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty, land: will never be purged away; but with Blood. I had as I now think: vainly flattered <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> without very much bloodshed; it might be done.'Four other raiders were executed on December 16 and two more on March 16, 1860.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you are--but {{not in the}} way you mean. You {{have made}} me discontented with <b>myself,</b> <b>that's</b> all, and I'm {{going to get out of}} the tall timber and see if I can't do {{something}} in the big world. I want to win your respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{love to see}} beauty enjoying itself gracefully. My idea of a {{woman is}} {{incompatible}} with {{the hard work of}} the world. I would fain do <b>that</b> <b>myself,</b> so <b>that</b> she should ever be lovely." ...|$|R
60|$|Joe got mad {{and used}} awful language. But that didn't help none. So I talked soft and kind to Charley. That's {{the way to}} handle feebs. If you get mad, they get worse. I know. I'm <b>that</b> way <b>myself.</b> <b>That's</b> why I was almost the death of Mrs. Bopp. She got mad.|$|R
500|$|His sister Geraldine {{expressed}} {{that she found}} it hard to accept the reality of his death, commenting, [...] "I don't think he made it. But I thought if they would let me fly over and see for <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> Harry's lodge is gone, then maybe I'd believe it for sure." ...|$|E
500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E
500|$|Pinkerton {{is named}} after the {{character}} BF Pinkerton from Madama Butterfly, who marries a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an [...] "asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star", Cuomo felt the character was [...] "the perfect symbol for the part of <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I am {{trying to come to}} terms with on this album." [...] Other titles considered included Playboy and Diving into the Wreck (after a poem by Adrienne Rich).|$|E
5000|$|Blake, {{speaking}} to Jo Youle and Mark Savage of the BBC, {{said that a}} lot of the vocals on the album were by him, despite relying more heavily on samples in previous work. [...] "There are times when it might seem there's a sample being used, but I've just sampled <b>myself.</b> <b>That's</b> what makes this record special compared to everything else I've done." ...|$|R
6000|$|The colonel {{muttered to}} himself, [...] "It {{has an effect}} on him, I can see it <b>myself.</b> <b>That's</b> enough for one time, I reckon. He's not very solid, yet, I suppose, and I might {{disintegrate}} him. I'll just put a sly question or two at him, now, and see if I can find out what his condition is, and where he's from." ...|$|R
60|$|She paused. I {{wondered}} to <b>myself</b> why <b>that</b> young revolutionist {{should show}} so little alacrity.|$|R
500|$|Furtado {{wanted to}} make a pop music record [...] "to prove to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I could be more streamlined", and cited as a major {{influence}} Madonna's album Ray of Light, saying that [...] "she was smooth but sexy, universal, epic, iconic!" [...] Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine suggested for Furtado to work with Timbaland, who had produced Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On", which featured Furtado in a remix, and done a remix of Furtado's hit [...] "Turn Off the Light”.|$|E
500|$|The {{family moved}} to the suburb of Juhu when Kapoor was one month old. She was educated at the Arya Vidya Mandir school in Juhu, where she confessed to being a [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "carefree" [...] child who would bully the boys. She excelled at sports such as rugby and basketball, and trained in Kathak, {{classical}} music and Latin dance. Kapoor, who practices Hinduism, states that she is [...] "quite religious", {{and that it is}} a way of [...] "reminding <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I need to be thankful for so much".|$|E
500|$|The {{set list}} {{consisted}} of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like [...] "Fashion" [...] from the Confessions of a Shopaholic soundtrack were also considered. In May, {{during an interview}} with Edmonton Sun Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer. She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show {{is supposed to be}} much bigger than the previous version. She said, [...] "Oh, you have no idea, [...] The tour that we're about to announce is such a dream that I have to pinch myself almost every day to remind <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> it's happening." ...|$|E

500|$|... "What a video!" [...] Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody enthused to Q. [...] "I {{have become}} obsessed with it {{and not just because}} I'm in love with Kimbra. Gotye himself is an {{engaging}} character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the album's {{lyrics are}} {{narrative}} and diaristic in nature, and were heavily drawn from Love's {{personal life and}} experiences in her teenage and young adult years. In a press release promoting the album, Love said: [...] "These songs are about my own weaknesses and impurities; things about <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I hate... paranoias, petty concerns, and pithy, pathetic things that are inside of me." [...] The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence, and, particularly, violence against women. Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, [...] "red lights", and self-destructiveness. Q Magazine described the lyrics on the record as [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "genuinely uninhibited." ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "All I Ask of <b>Myself</b> Is <b>That</b> I Hold Together" [...] was {{the first}} single from Ned's Atomic Dustbin's 1995 album, Brainbloodvolume.|$|R

5000|$|Tosh {{appeared}} in {{an episode of}} MTV's Punk'd as a criminal who broke into Mekhi Phifer's car. He played a fictional version of himself on [...] "Elevator" [...] produced by HBO's Runawaybox and had a small role as Cowboy Hat in the feature film The Love Guru starring Mike Myers. Of his own acting ability, Tosh says, [...] "I’m not a good actor. I can play myself, and a much gayer version of <b>myself.</b> <b>That’s</b> about my range." ...|$|R
