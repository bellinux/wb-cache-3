5|$|The {{clock was}} first {{installed}} in 1822. A second <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> was later added {{to show the}} time in London {{as well as the}} local time in Bristol; the red <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> shows Greenwich Mean Time and the black <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> shows Bristol time. This became necessary following the arrival of the railways, which required a standardised time for timetabling around the country, known as railway time; Bristol officially adopted railway time on 14 September 1852. The city is 2º 35' west of Greenwich, so when it is noon in Bristol by old local time, it is just after 12:10p.m. in London by standard time.|$|E

The Hour Hand is {{more powerful than the}} <b>Minute</b> <b>Hand,</b> but the <b>Minute</b> <b>Hand</b> is quicker and can be used more often. When combined, they make the First Key and {{take the form of a}} sword which bears some resemblance to the clock hands, having a silver and golden blade. It gives dominion over the Lower House and Monday.|$|E

25|$|The {{new look}} also {{featured}} a clock, which {{used the same}} software and layout as before, and used the balloon canvas as the background. The clock was also retained following the change to widescreen, however the software was changed so that the <b>minute</b> <b>hand,</b> instead of moving every second as it had previously, only moved once a minute.|$|E

25|$|A {{mechanism}} {{housed in}} the stone pedestal that supports the clock moves its hands. The mechanism is composed of six gears and an electrical meter. Every sixty seconds, the <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> moves , and the hour hand moves proportionately. Every hour, an additional control mechanism makes any necessary corrections to the displayed time and is capable of resetting the clock {{in the event of}} a power failure.|$|E
25|$|The Bats wings {{were also}} {{accompanied}} by a clock, which featured a simplified Bats wings design, with the clock face replacing the globe and eyes, and the intrequate lines {{that made up the}} bats wing removed. The noticeable thing about this clock design is the length of the second hand. While the minute and hour hands never went outside the circle at the centre, the second hand went out as far as the bats wings themselves, making the second hand easily twice as long as the <b>minute</b> <b>hand.</b> The clock was occasionally accompanied by the BBC Pips when a programme started on the hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa's account {{of the events of}} the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, its <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> near the 10 and its hour hand pointing virtually vertically downward, indicating a time of approximately 5:50; and to Victor Jorgensen's account of the circumstances of his own picture; concluding that Mendonsa's version of events is untenable.|$|E

500|$|The text of {{the codex}} was written two columns per page, 27-30 lines per page, 17 letters per line, in <b>minute</b> <b>hand,</b> in brown ink. The same scribe wrote all four Gospels. There are breathings and accents used in regular form, but {{in some sort of}} system. There is not found iota subscript, iota adscriptum occurs very often (especially in Mark).|$|E
500|$|In 1675, Huygens and Robert Hooke {{invented the}} spiral balance, or the hairspring, {{designed}} {{to control the}} oscillating speed of the balance wheel. This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. [...] This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10minutes per day, similar {{to the effect of}} the pendulum upon mechanical clocks. The great English clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, {{was one of the first}} to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.|$|E
500|$|The first {{restoration}} {{took place}} in 1821, including a re-roofing paid for by a daughter of Byrom. Between 1874 and 1878 work was done {{at a cost of}} £1600 and in 1898 the lighting was converted from gas to electric, substantial internal modifications were carried out and repairs made to the clock tower which cost around £2200. The church bells, which were described by a local journalist for the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser as [...] "among the best peal of bells in Manchester", were rehung in 1832 and again around 1883. The tower had clock dials on all four sides. A <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> was added to the clock in 1833 and its mechanism was replaced around 1906. The graveyard was paved with tombstones.|$|E
50|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} this clock {{is the fact that}} originally, Andrew Dreger Sr. set it to display the solar time of the {{international}} cities rather than the, by then accepted, time zone times. This means the <b>minute</b> <b>hands</b> of the international cities were not always pointing to the same minute. In 1933 when the Dreger Clock was completed, the time zone standard was well established, however solar time was the setting used, as seen in early photos of the clock in some of the historical articles about the clock. When the clock was moved to Knott's Berry Farm in 1952-53, the clock faces were adjusted to the time zone standard, where all <b>minute</b> <b>hands</b> are in agreement, and only the hour hands are different.|$|R

500|$|The {{invention}} of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E

2500|$|In most locations, {{the largest}} {{constituent}} is the [...] "principal lunar semi-diurnal", {{also known as}} the M2 (or M2) tidal constituent. Its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a tidal lunar day, which is the average time separating one lunar zenith from the next, and thus is the time required for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. Simple tide clocks track this constituent. The lunar day is longer than the Earth day because the Moon orbits in the same direction the Earth spins. This is analogous to the <b>minute</b> <b>hand</b> on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05½ (not at 1:00).|$|E
