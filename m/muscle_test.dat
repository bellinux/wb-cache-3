5000|$|A manual <b>muscle</b> <b>test</b> in AK is {{conducted}} {{by having the}} patient resist using the target muscle or muscle group while the practitioner applies a force. A smooth response is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "strong muscle" [...] and a response that was not appropriate is sometimes called a [...] "weak response". This is not a raw test of strength, but rather a subjective evaluation of tension in the muscle and smoothness of response, taken to be indicative of a difference in spindle cell response during contraction. These differences in muscle response are claimed to be indicative of various stresses and imbalances in the body. A weak <b>muscle</b> <b>test</b> is equated to dysfunction and chemical or structural imbalance or mental stress, indicative of suboptimal functioning. It may be suboptimal functioning of the tested target muscle, or a normally optimally functioning muscle can be used as an indicator muscle for other physiological testing. A commonly known and very basic test is the arm-pull-down test, or [...] "Delta test," [...] where the patient resists as the practitioner exerts a downward force on an extended arm. Proper positioning is paramount to ensure that the muscle in question is isolated or positioned as the prime mover, minimizing interference from adjacent muscle groups.|$|E

Though its use is deprecated by the ICAK, stimulation to test muscle response to a certain chemical is also done by contact or proximity (for instance, testing while the patient holds a bottle of pills).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the functional outcomes and long-term effects on muscle strength of femoral shaft fractures treated with intramedullary (IM) antegrade nailing using a standard piriformis start point. DESIGN: Retrospective Outcome Study. SETTING: Tertiary Level Teaching Hospital and Referral Centre for the Province of British Columbia. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients (7 female, 14 male; mean age 34. 5 years, range 16 - 56 years) with isolated femoral shaft fractures who {{were treated with}} standard antegrade reamed interlocking IM nailing and who had a minimum 1 -year follow-up were identified through the Orthopaedic Trauma Database. All patients had isokinetic <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> of their hip abductors, hip extensors, and knee extensors using the KinCom <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> machine. Of the patients, 10 underwent formal gait lab analysis. All of the patients answered a questionnaire and completed the Short Form (SF) - 36 and Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment outcome measures. INTERVENTION: Antegrade reamed interlocking IM nailing of femoral shaft fractures using a standard trochanteric fossa (also referred to as piriformis fossa) starting point. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Examination of muscle strength, using 2 different objective measures (KinCom and gait analysis). The KinCom <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> machine was used for isokinetic <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> of hip abductors, hip extensors, and knee extensors. Outcome questionnaires were used to evaluate function (Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment) and general health (SF- 36). RESULTS: Isokinetic <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> showed a statistically significant lower peak torque generation by the hip abductors (P= 0. 003) and hip extensors (P= 0. 046) from the uninjured contralateral side. The gait lab analysis did not show important changes in gait pattern. Scores for the SF- 36 were 51. 77 +/- 7. 55 and 53. 73 +/- 8. 70. Scores for the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (S-MFA) were 7. 74 and 8. 66. Both scores did not indicate any significant disability.

Therefore, it is hypothesised that DMT {{might be used to}} detect deceit as well, and the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if grip strength via dynamometric <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> (DMT) could be used to distinguish lies from truth. Methods A prospective study of diagnostic test accuracy was carried out. Twenty participants, aged 18 - 65 years, with healthy hands, were recruited. Participants were given a visual stimulus and followed an auditory instruction to lie or to tell the truth about the stimulus, before recording grip strength with a dynamometer.

Twenty-one patients fulfilling the Halstead's postpolio-syndrome criteria participated in postpolio-syndrome group. The remaining nineteen patients formed non-postpolio-syndrome group. Control group was composed of forty healthy subjects. Quality of life was evaluated by Nottingham Health Profile, depression by Beck Depression Scale and fatigue by Fatigue Symptom Inventory. Isometric muscle strength was measured by manual <b>muscle</b> <b>testing.</b> ResultsTotal manual <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> score was 26. 19 ± 13. 24 (median: 29) in postpolio-syndrome group and 30. 08 ± 8. 9 (median: 32) in non-postpolio-syndrome group. Total manual <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> scores of non-postpolio-syndrome group were significantly higher than that of postpolio-syndrome group. Patients with postpolio-syndrome reported significantly higher levels of fatigue and reduced quality of life in terms of physical mobility, pain and energy when compared with patients without postpolio-syndrome and control group.
