5|$|Kanhopatra's {{history is}} known through stories passed down over centuries, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to {{separate}} fact and fiction. Most accounts agree about her birth to Shama the courtesan and {{her death in}} the Vithoba temple when the Badshah of Bidar sought her. However, the characters of Sadashiva Malagujar (her alleged father) and Hausa the maid do not appear in all accounts.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were set down and distributed due to the excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|The craft guilds {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative equality {{of income and}} opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains were seen in London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer craftsmen. As a result, under EdwardIII many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Walter's granddaughters Maud and Margaret {{were due}} to inherit Walter's {{remaining}} estates on his death, {{but they were still}} unmarried, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for them to hold property in their own right. Henry informally divided the lands up between them, giving Ludlow to Maud and marrying her to one of his royal favourites, Peter de Geneva, cancelling many of the debts they had inherited from Walter at the same time. Peter died in 1249 and Maud married a second time, this time to Geoffrey de Geneville, a friend of the Prince Edward, the future king. In 1260, Henry officially split up Walter's estate, allowing Geoffrey to retain the castle.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used}} to detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to generalize from single studies.|$|E
