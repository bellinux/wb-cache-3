40|$|In early 1997, the Seveso- 2 Directive {{came into}} force as an EU-legislation on the {{identification}} and prevention of <b>major</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>hazard</b> accidents. The Directive is mandatory for implementation in all fifteen EU Member States. The experiences with Seveso- 1 had led to understanding that industry needs to apply more emphasis to safety management systems—this is a major addition resulting from the new Directive. Consequence modeling and risk quantification for ultimate use in land-use planning, accounting for domino effects are also aspects of the new Directive. Implementation into {{national laws and regulations}} will be completed throughout the EU countries {{during the first half of}} 1999. In the Netherlands, the introduction of Seveso- 2 was also used to integrate requirements from various earlier statutoly requirements: external and environmental hazards, occupational safety, and on-site/off-site emergency response. Up to now, these disciplines were treated rather separately, and they obliged industries to report to and communicate with three separate authorities. All parties involved desired more integration of the various requirements to reduce wasted effort and avoid costly confusion. During the past two years, some pilot projects on the preparation of integrated safety reporting (obligatoiy for higher tier establishments), and on the development of related safety management systems have been carried out. The most extensive pilot was the one for ARCO Chemical (now Lyondell Chemical) in Botlek/Rotterdam. Close cooperation among industry, competent authorities (regulators), and consultants have contributed to a successful result, which has clarified the boundary limits of a safety report and which will contribute to efficient implementation of the Seveso- 2 requirements over the coming years...|$|E

40|$|According to {{widespread}} public opinion, environmental contaminants and food additives are <b>major</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> in food. In contrast, scientific {{evidence shows that}} levels of environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals or residues of pesticides, have greatly decreased {{in the last three}} decades and are much below the tolerable limits; food additives are strictly regulated and their proper use justifies no food safety concerns. The concept that a “de minimis” value or a Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) can be identified for any chemical is gaining ground in food toxicology. The popular belief that compounds of natural origin are intrinsically safer than synthetic ones is not supported by scientific evidence. - Nutrition oriented cancer research in the past was preoccupied with the idea that food contained man-made carcinogenic substances. Their detection and elimination was thought to reduce and perhaps avoid the risk of cancer. A paradigmatic change has occurred: from the hunt for carcinogenic chemicals in food, research has moved to the study of food constituents preventing cancer and to their mechanism of action. The occurrence of health-promoting food constituents forms the basis of the present interest in “functional foods”. However, criminal actions leading to hazardous contamination of food do occur, the Spanish oil catastrophe of 1981 being an extreme example of this. Continued vigilance will be required to protect consumers from unsafe products. ...|$|R

A sample response plan from the University of Arkansas emphasizes quick, effective strategy for containing chemical spill situations in a campus setting. Some key strategies from the sample response plan include notifying first responder officials through 911 with a brief but detailed description of the emergency, which sets in motion the relevant chain of command for chemical-related emergency response, and setting off fire alarms to initiate an evacuation of the building in its entirety.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) is {{a public}} health {{laboratory}} network consisting of 349 diagnostic pathology laboratories which employ approximately 4200 laboratory personnel. These laboratory workers (the majority of whom are females) may be exposed to various occupational health hazards {{during the course of}} their work, including chemical, physical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial hazards. Some of these hazards may specifically affect the reproductive ability of both male and female workers. Study Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and assess, based on field observations, interviews and measurements, the risk to reproductive health from occupational health <b>hazards</b> (focusing on <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards)</b> that might be present in histopathology laboratories of the NHLS. It was expected that this study could sensitise, raise awareness and improve control strategies and procedures aimed at reducing reproductive health risks to both male and female workers in this particular work environment and in other NHLS laboratories. Materials and Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study; the study population included five out of the fifteen existing NHLS histopathology laboratories in the country. Due to the limited time and resources available for this study four out of the five histopathology laboratories sampled were selected from the Gauteng Province (closest to the researcher) and an additional one from the Northern Cape Province. Results The reproductive health risk assessment process detailed in this report, has identified worker‟s exposure to formaldehyde during specimen cut-up, specimen storage and during the process of disposal and making up of formaldehyde solution, as potentially high risk. It also identified exposure to xylene vapours during the automated staining process (particularly when replacing chemicals in the equipment), as potentially high risk. Exposure to hazardous biological agents (HBAs) and various other chemical reagents, ergonomic stress and potential exposure to ionising radiation were identified as moderate reproductive health risks when performing specific histopathology laboratory processes. Discussion The outcome from the health risk assessment supported the conclusion from researchers reviewed in this study that reproductive health risks in the workplace warrant special consideration and exposure to specific hazards, such as organic solvents, might require the implementation of special measures to protect in particular, but not exclusively, pregnant workers. Some of the limitations related to this study include: limited research data on reproductive health and the difficulty of inferring from animal studies to human reproduction; another problem relates to the use of occupational exposure limits (OELs) as benchmark for acceptable or over-exposure, as OELs might be determined without sufficient consideration of reproductive health endpoints. Due to the limited scope of this study only the <b>major</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> identified (formaldehyde and organic solvents, including xylene) could be sampled. Recommendations Protection of laboratory workers from reproductive health hazards should follow the standard occupational hygiene hierarchy of control practice, i. e. substitution and engineering methods should get precedence over strategies that rely on personal protective equipment. Although the substitution of hazardous substances such as formaldehyde and xylene in pathology laboratories appears possible, the health and safety implications of using substitutes must be investigated carefully. Following observations made during this study it was recommended that local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems should be maintained in good working order and their performance routinely tested, both by workers and by an external accredited body. Administrative measures which may include work restrictions and worker transfer should be implemented with caution, and always after thorough consultation with the individual worker. Such measures, when implemented, should be activated even before pregnancy is confirmed to prevent exposure during the crucial period of early foetal growth. It was recommended that the NHLS review the current policy and safe working procedure on pregnancy to include both male and female workers within reproductive age. In terms of personal protective equipment, it was recommended that when potential short-term, high exposure to formaldehyde or xylene is anticipated a half-mask respirator with the appropriate filtering media is applied. Workers must be adequately trained and fit tested to ensure that maximum protection is achieved. Additional information, more research data and detailed survey measurements will be required to substantiate the results of this assessment. In the meantime, the precautionary approach and best control practices should apply, to provide the maximum feasible protection for both males and female laboratory workers in their reproductive age...|$|R
