During the Oxfordian (a time span of six million years in the Late Jurassic) the distribution of tropical coral reefs was limited to about 35 °N and near to 25 °S. However, in Middle Oxfordian time, coral reefs were abundant only at higher latitudes and almost entirely missing near the equator. During that time the area of <b>maximum</b> <b>reef</b> development had shifted poleward to a belt lying between 20 °N and 35 °N, leaving hardly any coral formations at the lower inner-tropical latitudes. After demise towards the end of Middle Oxfordian time, the low-latitude reefs recovered during the Late Oxfordian, accompanied by a southward migration of reef corals in the northern hemisphere. As suggested by stable isotope and palynological data, the faunal migration can be correlated with a significant rise in seawater temperature during the Middle Oxfordian...|$|R

40|$|A sedimentological and stratigraphic {{study of}} Low Isles Reef off {{northern}} Queensland, Australia {{was carried out}} to improve understanding of factors that have governed Late Holocene carbonate deposition and reef development on the inner to middle shelf of the northern Great Barrier Reef. Low Isles Reef is one of 46 low wooded island-reefs unique to the northern Great Barrier Reef, which are situated in areas that lie in reach of river flood plumes and where inter-reef sediments are dominated by terrigenous mud. Radiocarbon ages from surface and subsurface sediment samples indicate that Low Isles Reef began to form at ca 3000 y BP, several thousand years after the Holocene sea-level still-stand, and reached sea-level soon after (within ~ 500 years). <b>Maximum</b> <b>reef</b> productivity, marked {{by the development of}} mature reef flats that contributed sediment to a central lagoon, was restricted to a narrow window of time, between 3000 and 2000 y BP. This interval corresponds to: (i) a fall in relative sea-level, from ~ 1 m above present at ca 5500 y BP to the current datum between 3000 and 2000 y BP; and (ii) a regional climate transition from pluvial (wetter) to the more arid conditions of today. The most recent stage of development (ca 2000 – 0 y BP) is characterized by extremely low rates of carbonate production and a dominance of destructive reef processes, namely storm-driven remobilization of reef-top sediments and transport of broken coral debris from the reef front and margins to the reef top.

During the model run, both, the external shape and the internal chronologic structure of the growing reef as well as the paleo-water-depths are continuously displayed and recorded. We tested the model on fossil reef systems growing in a range of different tectonic settings such as both on slowly subsiding islands like Tahiti (subsidence rates of 0. 25 m ka− 1) and rapidly subsiding islands like Hawaii (subsidence rate of 2. 5 mka− 1) as well as rapidly uplifting coastal settings like Huon Peninsula (uplift rates of 0. 5 to 4 m ka− 1) and more slowly uplifting settings like Haiti (uplift rates of 0. 55 mka− 1). The model runs show the sensitivity of the resulting overall morphology and internal age structure to different model parameters. Additionally the water depth at the time of deposition is recorded. This allows the constructions of virtual borehole logs with the coral age profiles and the paleo water depth at the time of growth both displayed and recorded. Because the model is implemented as a macro in a popular spreadsheet program, it may be easily adapted or extended to model the growth of different reef and carbonate platform settings. Single model runs take a few minutes on a standard (2 GHz CoreDuo) desktop computer under Windows XP. The model may be used to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions such as <b>maximum</b> <b>reef</b> growth, erosion rates, subsidence or uplift on both, the general morphology of the reefs, and the internal chronologic structure. These results can then be compared to observed data allowing different hypothesis concerning reefs development to be tested. The model may also be used to assist in finding sampling locations in reef bodies that are likely to contain critical information for sea level studies. SEALEX is available online at [URL]...|$|R

For example, the United States Coral <b>Reef</b> Task <b>Force’s</b> Mapping and Information Working Group has outlined a specific goal to map all coral reefs below 30 m depth by 2009.

Extensive modern scientific surveys were implemented around the territory in 2001 and have since continued and increased. The presence of protected areas and the existence of scientific data collected with state of the art technology have made the site a priority for the Coral <b>Reef</b> Task <b>Force.</b> In this study, methods for classifying surficial seafloor characteristics as bathymetric position index (BPI) zones and structures were developed and applied to the study sites. BPI zones and structures were classified by using algorithms that combine high-resolution (1 m) multibeam bathymetry and its derivatives: bathymetric position index at multiple scales and slope. The development of algorithms and the classification scheme involved the use of historical and current classification studies and three-dimensional visualization. In addition, the BPI zones and structures were compared to limited biological, geological, and physical attributes recorded during accuracy assessment surveys (photos) and towed diver surveys (video). A rugosity (surface ratio) analysis was added to the study to give a picture of the seafloor roughness. The BPI zone and structure classifications overlap and extend existing classifications from Ikonos satellite imagery for water depths shallower than 30 m. Methods, data and classifications developed and applied in this study will be available to the public as a benthic habitat mapping tool (ArcGIS extension), in an online GIS data archive, and on a compact disc attached to this thesis. They contribute to a broader understanding of the marine and coastal environment and will serve as a baseline of information for benthic habitat mapping and future biological, ecological, and geological surveys. The baseline gives a good indication of characteristics that may indicate areas of high biodiversity.
