5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one way to continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

25|$|During the {{elaborate}} mating dance, the male of some pseudoscorpion species pulls a female over a spermatophore previously laid upon a surface. In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs. The female carries the fertilised {{eggs in a}} brood pouch attached to her abdomen, and the young ride on the mother {{for a short time}} after they hatch. Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single brood; there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one brood per year. The young go through three molts {{over the course of several}} years before reaching adulthood. Adult pseudoscorpions live 2 to 3 years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} insect flight {{is the body}} tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as forward velocity increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the downstroke, the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal efficiency through as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful upstroke of the flapping motion.|$|E
