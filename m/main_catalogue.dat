This website gives electronic access to several thousand pathology specimens in our pathology teaching collection. It is intended for use by undergraduate and postgraduate students in the health sciences. There are currently three <b>main</b> <b>catalogues</b> for (1) the anatomical pathology collection (2) the forensic pathology collection and (3) the obstetrics and gynaecology collection. (A paediatric pathology section is in the pipeline). This is an historical collection (begun in the 1920 ’s) so the cataloguing is rather old fashioned. The specimens are catalogued by organ or system e. g. “kidneys” and then by broad pathological category e. g. “neoplasms”. Each specimen has a brief description and commentary along with good quality photographs. The emphasis is on macroscopic pathology; we are aiming to include more radiographic imaging and also microscopy going forward. The site also includes a more detailed section with “student cases” that are useful as teaching cases, "specialist cases" presenting unusual cases, and a few online exhibitions around special topics.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{photometric}} data obtained by the Hipparcos and Tycho missions is presented. The photometric signals and their reduction to magnitudes are described, {{as well as the}} passbands and their evolution. The main mission photometry provided on average 110 observations for each of the 118 000 stars observed during the mission. The accuracies for this epoch photometry range from a few millimagnitudes for the brightest stars to a few hundreds of a magnitude for the fainter ones. The data coverage was very much a function of ecliptic latitude, with the most homogeneous coverage near the ecliptic poles, and the most observations close to ecliptic latitude 47. The Hipparcos epoch photometry for all stars was investigated for variability and around 970 new periodic variables were discovered, as well as some 7000 unresolved variables (including micro variables, irregular variables, as well as variables for which a period could not be determined based on the Hipparcos data only). Median magnitudes as well as course variability indicators, derived from the epoch photometry, are included in the the <b>main</b> astrometric <b>catalogue.</b> All Hipparcos epoch photometry has been made available on the ASCII CD-ROM, disks 2 and 3. The Tycho epoch photometry was of lower accuracy, but provided useful colour index information. Only epoch photometry for a selection of the brighter stars in the Tycho catalogue has been preserved on the ASCII CD-ROM disk 4. More epoch photometry can be obtained through the CDS in Strasbourg. Mean magnitudes obtained from the Tycho photometry are, when available, included in the <b>main</b> Hipparcos astrometric <b>catalogue.</b> Key words: space astrometry; photometry; variable stars. 1...|$|R

Dr. Meng offered to permit scanning of his collection, an offer that was eagerly accepted by Scott Publishing. Scans from Dr. Meng's collection began appearing in volume 4 of the 2002 catalog.
