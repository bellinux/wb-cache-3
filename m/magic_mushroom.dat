This was {{due in large part}} to a wide dissemination of information on the topic, which included works such as those by author Carlos Castaneda, and several books that taught the technique of growing psilocybin mushrooms. One of the most popular of this latter group was published in 1976 under the pseudonyms O.T.Oss and O.N.Oeric by Jeremy Bigwood, Dennis J. McKenna, K. Harrison McKenna, and Terence McKenna, entitled Psilocybin: <b>Magic</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Grower's Guide. Over 100,000 copies were sold by 1981.
