40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the accuracy of}} several high-resolution and high-order finite volume schemes in Implicit Large Eddy Simulation of weakly-compressible turbulent channel flow. The main objective is to investigate the properties of numerical schemes, originally designed for compressible flows, in low Mach compressible, near-wall turbulent flows. Variants of the Monotone Upstream-centred Scheme for Conservation Laws and Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory schemes for orders of accuracy ranging from second to ninth order, {{as well as with}} and without low Mach corrections, have been investigated. The performance of the schemes has been assessed against incompressible Direct Numerical Simulations. Detailed comparisons of the velocity profiles, turbulent shear stresses and higher-order turbulent statistics reveal that the low <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> can significantly reduce the numerical dissipation of the methods in low Mach boundary layer flows. The effects of the low <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> have more profound impact on second and third-order schemes, but they also improve the accuracy of fifth order schemes. The ninth-order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme is the least dissipative scheme and it is shown that the implementation of the low <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> in conjunction with this scheme has a significant anti-dissipative effect that adversely affects the accuracy. Finally, the computational cost required for obtaining the improved accuracy using increasingly higher order schemes is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{article is}} {{composed}} of three self-consistent chapters that can be read independently of each other. In Chapter 1, we define and we analyze the low Mach number problem through a linear analysis of a perturbed linear wave equation. Then, we show how to modify Godunov type schemes applied to the linear wave equation to make this scheme accurate at any Mach number. This allows to define an all <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> and to propose a linear all Mach Godunov scheme for the linear wave equation. In Chapter 2, we apply the all <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> proposed in Chapter 1 {{to the case of}} the non-linear barotropic Euler system when the Godunov type scheme is a Roe scheme. A linear stability result is proposed and a formal asymptotic analysis justifies the construction in this non-linear case by showing how this construction is related with the linear analysis of Chapter 1. At last, we apply in Chapter 3 the all <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> proposed in Chapter 1 {{in the case of the}} full Euler compressible system. Numerous numerical results proposed in Chapters 1, 2 and 3 justify the theoretical results and show that the obtained all Mach Godunov type schemes are both accurate and stable for all Mach numbers. We also underline that the proposed approach can be applied to other schemes and allows to justify other existing all Mach schemes...|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the evaluation}} of wall interference corrections for three-dimensional aircraft configurations is presented. The Mach number and angle-of-attack corrections are obtained by numerically solving the Laplace equation in a parallelepiped with boundary conditions supplied mainly from experimental pressure measurements. A portion of these measurements and other wind-tunnel data required by the procedure may be replaced by theoretical estimates if not available from experiments. The accuracy of the correction results will then depend on the accuracy of these estimates. The correction procedure is applied to an isolated wing and to a wing-tail configuration in a solid-wall wind tunnel. It is found that neglecting twist and camber corrections for the wing effectively increases the tail angle-of-attack <b>correction.</b> Two different <b>Mach</b> number <b>corrections</b> can be calculated for the wing and tail. However, since only one <b>Mach</b> number <b>correction</b> is allowed for both the wing and the tail, and since the wing surface area is larger than the tail surface area, the final correction tends to be closer to the required wing correction. This is a source of error for the tail results...|$|R
40|$|A new, well posed, {{two-dimensional}} two-mode incompressible Kelvin{Helmholtz instability {{test case}} has been chosen to explore {{the ability of a}} compressible algorithm, Godunov-type scheme with the low Mach number correction, which can be used for simulations involving low Mach numbers, to capture the observed vortex pairing process due to the initial Kelvin{Helmholtz instability growth on low resolution grid. The order of accuracy, 2 nd and 5 th, of the compressible algorithm is also highlighted. The observed vortex pairing results and the corresponding momentum thickness of the mixing layer against time are compared with results obtained using the same compressible algorithm but without the low Mach number correction and three other methods, a Lagrange remap method where the Lagrange phase is 2 nd order accurate in space and time while the remap phase is 3 rd order accurate in space and 2 nd order accurate in time, a 5 th order accurate in space and time nite di erence type method based on the wave propagation algorithm and a 5 th order spatial and 3 rd order temporal accurate Godunov method utilising the SLAU numerical ux with low Mach capture property. The ability of the compressible ow solver of the commercial software, ANSYS Fluent, in solving low Mach ows is also examined for both implicit and explicit methods provided in the compressible ow solver. In the present two dimensional two mode incompressible Kelvin{Helmholtz instability test case, the ow conditions, stream velocities, length-scales and Reynolds numbers, are taken from an experiment conducted on the observation of vortex pairing process. Three di erent values of low Mach numbers, 0 : 2, 0 : 02 and 0 : 002 have been tested on grid resolutions of 24 24, 32 32, 48 48 and 64 64 on all the di erent numerical approaches. The results obtained show the vortex pairing process can be captured on a low grid resolution with the low Mach number correction applied down to 0 : 002 with 2 nd and 5 th order Godunovtype methods. Results also demonstrate clearly that a speci cally designed low <b>Mach</b> <b>correction</b> or ux is required for all algorithms except the Lagrange-remap approach, where dissipation is independent of Mach number. ANSYS Fluent's compressible ow solver with the implicit time stepping method also captures the vortex pairing on low resolutions but excessive dissipation prevents the instability growth when explicit time stepping method is applied...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} the {{calculation}} of wall interference corrections are based on boundary conditions which require a knowledge of ventilated wall porosity parameters, and which are unsuitable for deformed walls. The method described uses a simple exponential decay of pressure distribution beyond the most upstream and downstream limits in order to evaluate Mach number and incidence corrections given by the method proposed by Papelier et al. (1978). It is found that, while the upstream contribution to incidence correction is significant, the upstream and downstream contributions to <b>Mach</b> number <b>correction</b> are negligible...|$|R
40|$|Sidewall {{boundary}} layer effects were investigated by applying partial upstream sidewall {{boundary layer}} removal in the Langley 0. 3 -m transonic cryogenic tunnel. Over {{the range of}} sidewall boundary layer displacement thickness of these tests the influence on pressure distribution {{was found to be}} small for subcritical conditions; however, for supercritical conditions the shock position was affected by the sidewall boundary layer. For these tests (with and without boundary layer remove) comparisons with predictions of the GRUMFOIL computer code indicated that <b>Mach</b> number <b>corrections</b> due to the sidewall boundary layer improve the agreement for both subcritical and supercritical conditions. The results also show that sidewall boundary layer removal reduces the magnitude of the sidewall correction; however, a suitable correction must still be made...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of sidewall boundary-layer effects in airfoil testing is treated {{by considering the}} changes in the flow area due to boundary-layer thinning {{under the influence of the}} airfoil flowfield. Using von Karman's momentum integral equation, it is shown that the sidewall boundary-layer thickness in the region of the airfoil can reduce to about half the undisturbed value under the conditions prevailing in testing of supercritical airfoils. A <b>Mach</b> number <b>correction</b> due to this increased width of the flow passage is proposed. Using the small disturbance approximation, the effect of the sidewall boundary-layers is shown to be equivalent to a change in the test Mach number and also in the airfoil thickness.

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} into the application of turbulence models to the computation of flows in advanced scramjet combustors, the multiple-scale turbulence model has been applied to a variety of flowfield predictions. The model appears to have a potential for improved predictions in a variety of areas relevant to combustor problems. This potential exists because of the partition of the turbulence energy spectrum that is the major feature of the model and which allows the turbulence energy dissipation rate to be out of phase with turbulent energy production. To establish the general reliability of the approach, it has been tested through comparison of predictions with experimental data. An appreciable overall improvement in the generality of the predictions is observed, as compared to those of the basic two-equation turbulence model.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on two CAST 10 - 2 airfoil models with chords of 3 in. and 6 in. To evaluate the extent of sidewall influence on airfoil tests at transonic Mach numbers. The tests were conducted in the Langley 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel two-dimensional test section equipped with an upstream sidewall boundary layer removal system which reduces the boundary layer displacement thickness to about 1 percent of model halfspan from an initial 2 percent without boundary layer removal. Test results have shown {{the changes in the}} location of the shock on the upper surface of the airfoil to be about the same for both models with and without sidewall boundary layer removal. Even though large differences were noted in the high lift characteristics of the two models, the sidewall boundary layer removal had little effect on the differences.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a <b>Mach</b> number <b>correction</b> on a model for {{predicting}} the length of transition was investigated. The transition length decreases as the turbulent spot production rate increases. Much of the data for predicting the spot production rate comes from low speed flow experiments. Recent data and analysis showed that the spot production rate is affected by Mach number. The degree of agreement between analysis and data for turbine blade heat transfer without film cooling is strongly dependent of accurately predicting the length of transition. Consequently, turbine blade heat transfer data sets were used to validate a transition length turbulence model. A method for modifying models {{for the length of}} transition to account for Mach number effects is presented. The modification was made to two transition length models. The modified models were incorporated into the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes code, RVCQ 3 D. Comparisons were made between predicted and measured midspan surface heat transfer for stator and rotor turbine blades. The results showed that accounting for Mach number effects significantly improved the agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|By {{adapting}} solely top {{and bottom}} flexible walls of a solid-walled test section of rectangular cross section it can be achieved that the wall interferences (<b>Mach</b> number <b>correction,</b> angle of attack correction) are zero along the test section centreline, when testing three-dimensional models. The shapes of the flexible {{top and bottom}} walls {{are determined by the}} well- known Wedemeyer/Lamarche method of two-dimensional wall adaptation for three-dimensional models. The method performs the wall shape determination in a single computational step, at least when starting from the wall shapes of a preceding Mach number or angle of attack. It uses - in the original computer code of Lamarche - a numerical representation of the necessary mathematical operators. The computing time of 17 seconds on a personal computer could be reduced to 0. 3 seconds by using an analytical representation of the operators - following a proposal of E. Wedemeyer.

A detailed discussion of past work on this topic is presented first. Next, {{an overview of the}} decambering approach is presented and is illustrated by applying the approach to the prediction of the two-dimensional C(sub l) and C(sub m) curves for an airfoil.

40|$|The accuracy, robustness, {{dissipation}} {{characteristics and}} efficiency of several structured and unstructured grid methods are investigated {{with reference to the}} low Mach double vortex pairing flow problem. The aim of the study is to shed light into the numerical advantages and disadvantages of different numerical discretizations, principally designed for shock-capturing, in low Mach vortical flows. The methods include structured and unstructured finite volume and Lagrange-Remap methods, with accuracy ranging from 2 nd to 9 th-order, with and without applying low-Mach corrections. Comparison of the schemes is presented for the vortex evolution, momentum thickness, as well as for their numerical dissipation versus the viscous and total dissipation. The study shows that the momentum thickness and large scale features of a basic vortical structure are well resolved even at the lowest grid resolution of 32 √ó 32 provided that the numerical schemes are of a high-order of accuracy or the numerical framework is sufficiently non-dissipative. The implementation of the finite volume methods in unstructured triangular meshes provides the best results even without low <b>Mach</b> number <b>corrections</b> provided that a higher-order advective discretization for the advective fluxes is employed. The compressible Lagrange-Remap framework is computationally the fastest one, although the numerical error for the momentum thickness does not reduce as fast as for other numerical schemes and computational frameworks, e. g., when higher-order schemes are utilized. It is also shown that the low-Mach number correction has a lesser effect on the results as the order of the spatial accuracy increases...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{aerodynamics}} {{and power}} estimation for a Mad Rock Marine Solution hydro craft (or airboat), using a Hoverhawk Warp Drive propfan, were performed. With a given on?the-shelf {{controllable pitch propeller}} blade of the Warp Drive Propfan, measurement of geometry data was obtained, along with the airboat resistance data. In the current work, based on the available data, a series of virtual full-scale propellers was designed and built. These virtual full-scale propellers were then tested under ?open water? (open air) condition in a virtual wind tunnel, simulated by the in-house propeller software package, PROPELLA. A series of thrust coefficients KT and power coefficients KP were then obtained {{after a number of}} computational runs. These obtained coefficients from the virtual wind tunnel, as the basis, or the fundamental design charts, were then used for the design and optimization of the propulsion system of the airboat. Different from the traditional design methods that use Bp-d diagram or charts etc., a computer-aided design method was developed. This CAD method utilizes the advantage of spreadsheet software for generation of trend-line equations and then for interpolations for optimization. The design optimization was performed in terms of efficiency (minimum required power for the given airboat speed) for 4, 6 and 8 propfan blades. <b>Mach</b> number <b>correction</b> was included.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the turbulent Mach number () and the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons (f_ esc) in high-redshift galaxies. Approximating the turbulence as isothermal and isotropic, we show that the increase in the variance in column densities from M= 1 to M= 10 causes f_ esc to increase by ‚âà 25 %, and the increase from M= 1 to M= 20 causes f_ esc to increases by ‚âà 50 % for a medium with opacity œÑ‚âà 1. At a fixed <b>Mach</b> number, the <b>correction</b> factor for escape fraction relative to a constant column density case scales exponentially with the opacity in the cell, which has a large impact for simulated star forming regions. Furthermore, in simulations of isotropic turbulence with full atomic/ionic cooling and chemistry, the fraction of HI drops by a factor of ‚âà 2. 5 at M‚âà 10 even when the mean temperature is ‚âà 5 √ó 10 ^ 3 K. If turbulence is unresolved, these effects together enhance f_ esc by a factor > 3 at Mach numbers above 10. Such Mach numbers are common at high-redshifts where vigorous turbulence is driven by supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and merger activity, as shown both by numerical simulations and observations. These results, if implemented in the current hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to account for unresolved turbulence, can boost the theoretical predictions of the Lyman Continuum photon escape fraction and further constrain the sources of reionization.

40|$|This Philosophiae Doctor thesis {{presents}} the motivation, objectives and reasoning behind the undertaken project. This research, study {{the capability of}} compressible Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) in predicting free shear layer flows, under different free stream regimes (Static and Co-flow jets). Unsteady flows or jet flows are non-uniform in structure, temperature, pressure and velocity. Turbulent mixing is of particular importance for the developing of this class of flows. As a shear layer is formed immediately downstream of the jet exhaust, an early linear instability involving exponential growth of small perturbations is introduced at the jet discharge. Beyond this development stage, in the non-linear Kelvin-Helmholtz instability region large scale vortex rings roll up, and their dynamics of formation and merging become the defining feature of the transitional shear flow into fully developed regime. This class of flows is particularly relevant to numerical predictions, as the extreme nature of the flow in question is considered as a benchmark; however, experimental data should be selected carefully as some results are controversial. To qualify the behaviour of unsteady flows, some important criteria have been selected {{for the analysis of}} the flow quantities at different regions of the flow field (average velocities, Reynolds stresses and dissipation rates). A good estimation of high-order statistics (Standard Deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis) correspond to mathematical steadiness and convergence of results. From the physical point of view, similarity analysis between jet‚Äôs wake sections reveals physical steadiness in results. Spectral analysis of the different regions of the flow field {{could be used as a}} sign that the energy cascade is correctly predicted or efficiently enough since this is where the smallest scales are usually present and which in effect require to be modelled by the different numerical schemes. The flow solver has been reviewed and improved. The former, a revised version of the reconstruction numerical schemes (WENO 5 th and WENO 9 th orders) has been performed and tested, the correspondent results have been compared against analytical data; the latter, correction of the method to compute the Jacobian of the transformation (singularity correction), by changing from the standard algebraic to geometric method, and augmented with transparent boundary condition, giving mathematical and physical meaning to the obtained results. The flow solver improvements and review have been verified and validated through simulations of a compressible Convergent-Divergent Nozzle (CDN), and the standard and a modified version of the Shock tube test cases, where the results are gained with minimal modelling effort. The study of numerical errors associated with the simulations of turbulent flows, for unsteady explicit time step predictions, have been performed and a new formula proposed. Ten different computational methods have been employed in the framework of ILES and computations have been performed for a jet flow configuration for which experimental data and DNS are available. It can be seen that a numerical error bar can be defined that takes into account the errors arising from the different numerical building blocks of the simulation method. The effects of different grids, Riemann solvers and numerical reconstruction schemes have been considered, however, the approach can be extended to take into account the effects of the initial and boundary conditions as well as subgrid scale modelling, if applicable. From the physical analysis several observations were established, revealing that differences in terms of jet‚Äôs core size are not an important parameter in terms of quantification and qualification of predictions, in other words, data should be reduced to the jet‚Äôs inertial reference system. Moreover, the comparative study has been performed to identify the differences between Riemann solvers (CBS and HLLC), Low <b>Mach</b> number Limiting/ <b>Corrections</b> (LMC), numerical reconstruction schemes (MUSCL and WENO) and spatial order of accuracy (2 nd-order LMC, 5 th-order LMC and 9 th-order schemes) in combination with the most efficient cost/resolution discretization level (Medium mesh). The comparisons between results reveals for the Static and Co-Flow jets that the CBS MUSCL 5 th-order LMC and the HLLC MUSCL 5 th-order LMC as the most accurate schemes in predicting this class of flows, accordingly. Furthermore, the selected numerical methods show to be in accordance with the empirical (Static) and experimental (Co-flow) results in terms of resonance frequency and/or Strouhal number; also, the expected behaviour in terms of spectral energy decay rate throughout the jet‚Äôs central line is observed. To conclude the study of the Static jet case, a possible explanation for the jet‚Äôs buoyancy effect is presented. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
