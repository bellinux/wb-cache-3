5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E

500|$|Serial numbers became commonplace {{after the}} United States passed the Gun Control Act of 1968. [...] This law {{mandated}} that all guns manufactured or imported {{into the country}} have a serial number.

[...] If a recovered weapon has had the serial numbers altered or destroyed, examiners can attempt to recover the original numbers. [...] The two main methods for the restoration of serial numbers are <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> inspection and chemical restoration. [...] It is recommended that <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> inspection be performed first due to the nondestructive nature of the method.

Three series of experiments and simulation show that all the <b>magnetic</b> <b>particles</b> are arranged in chain structures and orientated along {{the direction of the}} external magnetic field.
