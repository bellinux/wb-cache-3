5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

25|$|During the dead-ball era, {{baseball}} was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strategy-driven game, using {{a style of}} play now known as small ball or inside baseball. It relied much more on stolen bases and hit-and-run types of plays than on home runs. These strategies emphasized speed, perhaps by necessity.|$|E

25|$|The 1940 film Dark Command, {{based on}} a novel of the same name, is a fictionalized account of the events in <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> classic B-movie western style.

25|$|Economists such as Thomas DiLorenzo and Charles Adams {{argue that}} the Southern secession and the ensuing {{conflict}} was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fiscal quarrel than a war over slavery. Northern-inspired tariffs benefited Northern interests but were detrimental to Southern interests and were destroying {{the economy in the}} South. These tariffs would be less subject to states rights' arguments.|$|E

25|$|Nestmate {{recognition}} {{and the establishment}} of reproductive status and dominance are often maintained through facial markings and chemical signaling. The bodies of L. vechti are covered by a mixture of cuticular lipids and long hydrocarbons.

His later works show the {{dictator}} as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideologue, who pursued the ideas expressed in Mein Kampf (and elsewhere) despite their consequences. This has become a widely accepted view of Hitler, particularly in relation to the Holocaust.|$|R
25|$|Point Break is an American-German-Chinese co-{{production}}. Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw {{production services}} for the film. A script for the remake had been lying around for years, {{but it was not}} until Ericson Core pitched his idea to Warner Bros. that the film actually got off the ground. However, Core's idea for the film was significantly different than the script. His concept was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> big tentpole movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E
25|$|Equiano was a {{prominent}} figure in London and often served as {{a spokesman for the}} black community. He was one of the leading members of the Sons of Africa, a small abolitionist group composed of free Africans in London. They were closely allied with the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Equiano's comments on issues were frequently published in newspapers such as the Public Advertiser and the Morning Chronicle. He had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public voice than most Africans or Black Loyalists, and he seized various opportunities to use it.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} caused by locks is that, {{each time a}} lock goes through one fill-empty cycle, a lockful of water (tens of {{thousands}} up to millions of litres) is released to the lower pound. In more simplistic terms, on a canal where only one boat will fit into a lock, a boat travelling from the summit pound to the lowest pound is accompanied on its journey by one 'personal' lockful of water. A boat {{going the other way}} also transfers a lockful of water from the summit pound to the lowest pound. To prevent the canal from running dry, some method must be used to ensure that the water supply at the canal summit is constantly replenished at the rate that the water is being drained downwards. This is, of course <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem on an artificial canal crossing a watershed than on a river navigation.|$|E
50|$|Increasing use of long-acting {{reversible}} contraceptives (such as IUD and contraceptive implants) {{decreases the}} chance of unintended pregnancy by decreasing {{the chance of}} incorrect use. Method failure is relatively rare with modern, highly effective contraceptives, and is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue when such methods are unavailable or not used.

50|$|Herpes gladiatorum is {{characterized}} by a rash with clusters of sometimes painful fluid-filled blisters, often on the neck, chest, face, stomach, and legs. The infection is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes), fever, sore throat, and headache. Often, the accompanying symptoms are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inconvenience than the actual skin blisters and rash.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{method used}} for hunting is camouflage. It {{is designed to}} break up the human outline so the hunter will not be spotted easily by the animal.

25|$|After the Arab Spring {{movements}} {{overturned the}} rulers of Tunisia and Egypt, Libya experienced a full-scale revolt beginning on 17 February 2011. Libya's authoritarian regime led by Muammar Gaddafi put up <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resistance compared to the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. While overthrowing the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia was a relatively quick process, Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprisings in Libya. The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the Interim Transitional National Council as an alternative government. One of Gaddafi's senior advisors responded by posting a tweet, wherein he resigned, defected, and advised Gaddafi to flee. By 20 February, the unrest had spread to Tripoli. On 27 February 2011, the National Transitional Council was established to administer the areas of Libya under rebel control. On 10 March 2011, France became {{the first state to}} officially recognise the council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot, {{in their}} {{review of the}} game, said that Katamari Forever [...] "carries on the series' {{tradition}} of wildly catchy soundtracks" [...] {{and said that the}} remixes of the older songs [...] "sound terrific". PALGN concurred, calling it a [...] "great soundtrack". The album was received warmly by reviewers such as Square Enix Music Online, who said that it was full of [...] "fresh, diverse, and often downright weird remixes". Describing it as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spiritual successor to the original game's soundtrack than the prior sequels, they said that it kept the [...] "upbeat, humorous, and sentimental feel" [...] of the songs in the original while taking them in new directions. The album reached #158 on the Japanese Oricon charts.|$|E
50|$|Russian {{access to}} the Dardanelles was also changed significantly. Their {{commercial}} ships were now to be granted unlimited access, as would the ships from any other nation trading with Russia. This gave Russia <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assurance that their commercial {{access to the}} Mediterranean would continue and effectively opened them to trade with all other nations.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, War in Middle-earth, whilst {{essentially}} an adventure game {{on a similar}} scale to the Midnight series, represented a switch from the adventure to an action philosophy, requiring the player {{to interact with the}} characters under their control directly, moving them individually in each of the battles, giving the game <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arcade/adventure feel.|$|R

500|$|Berg {{expressed}} regret {{in interviews}} {{about having to}} sacrifice certain story lines in the movie, due to time restraints. The television series allowed interpersonal issues to be addressed more in depth. [...] "The idea {{was to create a}} television show that exists as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soap opera, or an exploration of human beings," [...] said Berg in an interview, [...] "than as a chronicle of a football team's pursuit of glory." [...] The series was filmed partly in Austin, and a call went out for local football players to play part roles in the show. In an attempt to maintain an authentic Texas environment, elements were incorporated from local society. Football scenes were filmed at the local Pflugerville High School's Kuempel Stadium and at the RRISD Complex, while uniforms were based on those of real-life Pflugerville Panthers.|$|E
500|$|In June 2007 {{the band}} contributed a new song, [...] "Under the Boughs" [...] (which was later {{included}} on their second album), to the Kemado compilation Invaders. The group also released a split EP with Swedish doom metal band Witchcraft the same month, contributing new track [...] "Sea of Spears" [...] and {{a cover of}} Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] to the record. Gods of the Earth was the band's second album, released on April 1, 2008. The album, which is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collaborative writing effort than its predecessor, provided the band with its first Billboard 200 chart entry, reaching number 102. In support of the album, the band completed the Gods of the Earth Tour supported by artists such as Machine Head, Lamb of God and Clutch; the quartet also supported heavy metal veterans Metallica on their 2008 European Vacation Tour in July, and returned as the opening act {{for a number of}} legs on their 2009 World Magnetic Tour.|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf had {{announced}} that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would {{say things that}} made him think he {{was sitting next to}} Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rock album." [...] Child says {{that one of the most}} memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on [...] "Bad for Good". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.|$|E
50|$|The {{institution}} of family appears to very formative for a developing child. As such, this theory examines {{the relationship between}} family background and dropout rates. The relationship is not particularly strong, pas academic achievement has <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> influence than poor family socialization. Factors of poor family socialization include low parental expectations and <b>a</b> parent's lack <b>of</b> education.|$|R
50|$|Figures {{both within}} and outside the fashion world took on this {{gender-neutral}} style and made the look ever more popular. Singer, actress, and model Grace Jones was a key figure in furthering this type of fashion—keeping her hair short and wearing manly, oversized clothing. Scottish singer Annie Lennox did the same, but had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effect in the musical realm.|$|R
50|$|Miles wasn't {{particularly}} interested in jazz, professing to have <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interest in classical music; he received several copies of each Blue Note album he designed but gave most of them to friends or sold them to used record shops. Miles used the descriptions of the sessions relayed to him by producer Alfred Lion to create the artwork.|$|R
