5|$|The {{seventh and}} final match was between Randy Orton and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Both Orton and Triple H <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{upper hand in}} the match. During the match, Ric Flair and Batista {{interfered}} on behalf of Triple H, as they attacked Orton while the referee was knocked out. Jonathan Coachman also {{took part in the}} match as he ran down with a referee shirt and tried to act as a guest referee. Orton <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> upper hand over Flair, Batista and Coachman as he delivered an RKO on all of them. Triple H, however, managed to hit Orton with a steel chair, which proceeded with a Pedigree onto the same chair. Batista then rolled the referee into the ring, as Triple H covered Orton for the win via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Randy Orton faced Ric Flair in a steel cage match, which gained 68% of the vote. During the match, both Orton and Flair <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> upper hand. A {{spot in the}} match saw Flair hit a low blow on Orton and sent him into the cage, causing Orton to bleed. Orton regained the {{momentum}} by sending Flair into the cage, resulting in Flair bleeding. The match concluded with Orton performing an RKO for the win. After the match, the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{financial}} means {{to buy back}} their Woodland home, they rented the Steamboat House in Huntsville. The 69-year-old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble, requiring {{the use of a}} cane to get around. Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant, his wife shouldered the duties. Even so, during this period, he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama-Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.|$|E

5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> reactor started.|$|E
5|$|Bamlett was {{manager for}} four years, {{but was unable}} to muster any success, the club's highest {{position}} during his reign being 12th. The club was relegated to the Second Division again in 1931, and Bamlett was replaced by club secretary Walter Crickmer. This was Crickmer's first of two spells as manager of the club, retaining his position as secretary all the while. It lasted only a season, though, as he failed to return the club to the First Division. In June 1932, Scott Duncan was appointed as manager, but in his second season in charge he led the club to what remains a club record lowest League position; 20th in the Second Division. The club held faith in Duncan though, and he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> club back into the First Division by 1936. However, the club was relegated again the following year, and Walter Crickmer resumed control {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
5|$|Once his {{squadron}} {{arrived in}} Tripoli, Silvori sent the Tritone {{into the harbor}} under a flag of truce in order to begin negotiations with Karamanli's government. With assurances from the resident British consul {{that they would be}} safe, Silvori went ashore on the 26th and met the Tripolitanian envoy, General Haggi Mohammed. Although negotiations at first seemed to be going well, the next day Karamanli sent a note with suggested terms that essentially abrogated the peace treaty that British Admiral Edward Pellew had negotiated on Sardinia's behalf after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816. Seeing that Karamanli had no intention of offering acceptable terms, Sivori decided his best course of action would be to attack Tripoli. Before returning to his squadron Sivori <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> British consul to take under his protection what Sardinians remained in Tripoli. Salvori's force had a significant advantage over the Tripolitanian fleet, which only had a 12-gun brig and a pair of 6-gun schooners defending the harbor. Despite the disadvantage in naval power, Karamanli had significant forces ashore and several forts and shore batteries defending the harbor. Upon returning to his vessel, Salvori gave Karamanli a four-hour ultimatum that he would bombard the city unless better peace terms were offered by the Tripolitanians.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
