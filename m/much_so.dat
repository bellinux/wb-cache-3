5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E

With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E

This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Kelly pool {{has long}} been {{associated}} with gambling—so <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> that it was made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the state of Montana, for example, the playing of kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Likewise, the playing of kelly pool was banned in the Canadian province of Manitoba at least as of 1918. Gambling exploits associated with kelly pool were often depicted in Clare Briggs' comic strip of the same name, which centered on the game.
