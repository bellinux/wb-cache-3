Private Newlin with four other Marines, was manning a key position on the perimeter of the Nong Son outpost when the enemy launched a savage and well coordinated mortar and infantry assault, seriously wounding him and killing his four comrades. Propping himself against his machine gun, he poured a deadly accurate stream of fire into the charging ranks of the Viet Cong. Though repeatedly hit by small arms fire, he twice repelled enemy attempts to overrun his position. During the third attempt, a grenade explosion wounded him again and knocked him to the ground unconscious. The Viet Cong guerrillas, believing him dead, bypassed him and continued their assault on the main force. Meanwhile, Private Newlin regained consciousness, crawled back to his weapon, and brought it to bear on the rear of the enemy causing havoc and confusion among them. Spotting the enemy attempting to bring a captured 106 recoilless weapon to bear on other Marine positions, he shifted his fire, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and preventing them from firing the captured weapon. He then shifted his fire back to the primary enemy force, causing the enemy to stop their assault on the <b>Marine</b> <b>bunkers</b> and to once again attack his machine gun position. Valiantly fighting off two more enemy assaults, he firmly held his ground until mortally wounded. Private Newlin had single-handedly broken up and disorganized the entire enemy assault force, causing them to lose momentum and delaying them long enough for his fellow Marines to organize a defense and beat off their secondary attack. His indomitable courage, fortitude, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{greenhouse}} gas emission reduction potential from international shipping. Drawing from the International Maritime Organization’s most recent assessment of maritime greenhouse gas emissions and other sources, we investigate {{the current level of}} emissions from international maritime activity and look at factors influencing future emission levels such as projected activity levels, GHG-reducing technology options and the rate of their uptake, operational measures – foremost speed reduction – and fuel switching. We do not discuss the marginal abatement costs of maritime GHG-reduction measures – with the exception of speed reduction – due to insufficient evidence. Finally, we discuss factors that may influence international responses to maritime GHG reduction policies, though these are discussed more thoroughly in a companion paper (Kågeson, 2009). CO 2 emissions from maritime transport are larger than has previously been estimated The IMO finds that international maritime activity accounted for 843 Mt of CO 2 in 2007 or 45 % more than previous emission estimates from <b>marine</b> <b>bunkers.</b> This finding, for illustrative purposes, places 2007 international shipping emissions between the 2005 national emissions of India and Germany. International shipping accounts for approximately 2. 7 % of world CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion with all shipping activity (fishing, domestic and international) representing approximately 3. 3 % of total CO 2 from fuel combustion. Despite projected efficiency improvements, the IMO projects that CO 2 emissions from international maritime activity will grow through 2050 though this growth may significantly slowed through uptake of fuel efficient technologies and operating procedures. ...|$|E

On {{the day that the}} fighting ceased in the south, a massive coordinated attack by insurgents was underway in the Sunni territories. In five cities - Ramadi, Baghdad, Mahmudiya, Baquba and Mosul - attacks were underway. In Baghdad a suicide bomber killed four Iraqi soldiers, but the attacks in Mosul were the bloodiest. Four suicide bombers killed fifty-six civilians, eight Iraqi policemen and two American soldiers. The most intense fighting was in Baquba, where, with precise and strategic attack, the insurgents attacked and took control of the main police station and city hall, and burned down the home of the police chief. American and Iraqi troops withdrew from the city, but after a few hours American bomber planes hit insurgent positions in the city at city hall, the police station and at the football stadium. After the air strikes, the American forces entered the city without resistance.

40|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the International Maritime organisation (IMO) shipping sector is responsible for 3. 3 % of the global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol calls upon states to pursue limitation or reduction of emissions of GHG from <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels working through the IMO. In 2011, 14 years after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO has adopted mandatory energy efficiency measures for international shipping which can be treated as the first ever mandatory global GHG reduction instrument for an international industry. The MEPC approved an amendment of Annex VI of the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73 / 78) to introduce a mandatory Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for all ships. Considering the growth projections of human population and world trade the technical and operational measures {{may not be able to}} reduce the amount of GHG emissions from international shipping in a satisfactory level. Therefore, the IMO is considering to introduce market-based mechanisms that may serve two purposes including providing a fiscal incentive for the maritime industry to invest in more energy efficient manner and off-setting of growing ship emissions. Some leading developing countries already voiced their serious reservations on the newly adopted IMO regulations stating that by imposing the same obligation on all countries, irrespective of their economic status, this amendment has rejected the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (the CBDR Principle), which has always been the cornerstone of international climate change law discourses. They also claimed that negotiation for a market based mechanism should not be continued without a clear commitment from the developed counters for promotion of technical co-operation and transfer of technology relating to the improvement of energy efficiency of ships.

Fuel consumption by power and combined heat and power generation plants is available for individual plants. Bottom-up models were used to distribute statewide fuel sales-based CO 2 emissions by county for on-road vehicles, aircraft, and watercraft. All other sources of CO 2 emissions were allocated to counties based on surrogates for activity. CO 2 emissions by sector were estimated for each county, {{as well as for the}} South Coast Air Basin. It is important to note that emissions from some sources, notably electricity generation, were allocated to counties based on where the emissions were generated, rather than where the electricity was actually consumed. In addition, several sources of CO 2 emissions, such as electricity generated in and imported from other states and international <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels, were not included in the analysis. California Air Resource Board (CARB) does not include CO 2 emissions from interstate and international air travel, in the official California greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, so those emissions were allocated to counties for informational purposes only. Los Angeles County is responsible for by far the largest CO 2 emissions from combustion in the state: 83 Million metric tonnes (Mt), or 24 percent of total CO 2 emissions in California, more than twice that of the next county (Kern, with 38 Mt, or 11 percent of statewide emissions). The South Coast Air Basin accounts for 122 MtCO 2, or 35 percent of all emissions from fuel combustion in the state.

5000|$|Since the 1980s the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{has been}} the {{accepted}} standard for <b>marine</b> fuels (<b>bunkers).</b> The standard is listed under number 8217, with recent updates in 2005 and 2010. The standard divides fuels into residual and distillate fuels. The most common residual fuels in the shipping industry are RMG and RMK. [...] The {{differences between the two}} are mainly the density and viscosity, with RMG generally being delivered at 380 centistokes or less, and RMK at 700 centistokes or less. Ships with more advanced engines can process heavier, more viscous, and thus cheaper, fuel. Governing bodies (i.e., California, European Union) around the world have established Emission Control Areas (ECA) which limit the maximum sulfur of fuels burned in their ports to limit pollution, reducing the percentage of sulfur and other particulates from 4.5% m/m to as little as [...]10% as of 2015 inside an ECA. As of 2013 3.5% continued to be permitted outside an ECA, but the International Maritime Organization has planned to lower the sulfur content requirement outside the ECA's to 0.5% m/m by 2020. This is where Marine Distillate Fuels and other alternatives to use of heavy bunker fuel come into play. They have similar properties to diesel #2, which is used as road diesel around the world.

Foram {{realizadas}} medidas no intervalo de temperaturas de 170 a 400 K. O espectro em banda-X, à temperatura ambiente, apresentou um sinal isotrópico com típico desdobramento hiperfino de prótons com parâmetros: g = 2, 0028 ± 0, 0005; A = 6, 31 ± 0, 01 G para seis prótons equivalentes (septeto) e A´ = 1, 80 ± 0, 01 G para três prótons equivalentes (quarteto). Os resultados obtidos para as constantes de acoplamento hiperfino indicaram o radical perinaftenil como sendo o responsável pelo espectro septeto-quarteto deste derivado de petróleo. A variação de temperatura realizada com uma amostra de diesel marítimo (bunker) que já não apresentava os desdobramentos hiperfinos, inicialmente observados, revelou o aparecimento gradativo de linhas hiperfinas com o aumento da temperatura e um espectro com linhas totalmente resolvidas foi observado a 383 K. A simulação das linhas hiperfinas considerando somente o radical perinaftenil não foi suficiente para prever todas as linhas de ressonância contidas no espectro. O modelo teórico para o espectro registrado a 383 K consistiu da sobreposição de três grupos de linhas: um septeto-quarteto, um sexteto-quarteto e um quinteto-quarteto, com porcentagem de 53, 5 %, 30, 0 % e 16, 5 %, respectivamente. A análise dos parâmetros hiperfinos indicou a presença de radicais hidroxiperinaftenil e 4, 6 -dimetilperinaftenil após o aquecimento da amostra. As espécies químicas responsáveis pelo espectro de diesel marítimo sob aquecimento foram estudadas através de métodos quânticos nos níveis {{ab initio}} e semiempíricos. As constantes de acoplamento hiperfino obtidos através dos cálculos quânticos se aproximam dos valores obtidos experimentalmente. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at X- and W-bands {{was used in}} the <b>marine</b> diesel (<b>bunker)</b> study. Measurements were performed in the temperature range from 170 to 400 K. The X-band spectrum at room temperature exhibited isotropic sign with typical hf splitting of protons with parameters: g = 2. 0028 ± 0. 0005; A = 6. 31 ± 0. 01 G for six equivalent protons (septet) and A´ = 1. 80 ± 0. 01 G for three equivalent protons (quartet). The results obtained for hyperfine coupling constants pointed to perinaphthenyl radical the responsible for the septet-quartet spectrum of this oil by-product. The temperature variation performed with a marine diesel sample without hyperfine splitting, initially observed, revealed a progressive appearance of typical hf interaction of protons with the heating and a spectrum with resolved lines was observed at 383 K. Hyperfine line simulations considering only the perinaphthenyl radical was insufficient to predict all resonance lines contained in the spectrum. For the spectrum recorded at 383 K, the theoretical model consisted of the superposition of three line sets: a septet-quartet, a sextet-quartet, and a quintet-quartet with percentage of 53. 5 %, 30. 0 % and 16. 5 %, respectively. Analyses of the hyperfine parameters indicated the presence of perinaphthenyl, hydroxyperinaphthenyl and 4, 6 - dimetilperinaphthenyl radicals after sample heating.
