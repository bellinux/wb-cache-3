5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods.</b> The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

These <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> are used in low-traffic private roadways as well as public roads and highways. Geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads: separation, reinforcement, filtration and drainage; which increase the pavement performance, reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance.|$|E
25|$|As {{building}} {{continued into}} the late 1830s and 1840s, houses reflected an austere Greek Revival style. They were mostly brick laid in Flemish bond primarily, with running and American bond appearing more. Plain pilasters flanked the recessed entrances, with little ornament on the front facades. Newer roofing <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> made flat roofs possible. Some frame stores, most since demolished, were constructed in the neighborhood.|$|E

2500|$|Larger ship {{models have}} been used in museums to {{document}} historical ships, in companies for decoration and public relations. [...] These are typically built by commercial firms, or, in the past, model departments of large shipyards. One famous builder of ship models for the United States Navy was the firm of Gibbs and Cox.; a 1/48 scale model of the USS Missouri, which is on display at the Washington Navy Yard museum, required an estimated 77,000 man hours to construct.

2500|$|Dewey {{believed}} that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> they teach. [...] For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one’s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. [...] "No one," [...] according to Dewey, [...] "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [...] who does not retain [...] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [...] entire career" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.34). [...] According to Dewey, {{it is not that}} the “teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,” rather, “a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: [...] history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35). [...] The classroom teacher {{does not have to be}} a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scarcity}} of imported materials, {{together with a}} lack of skilled laborers, compelled the Fathers to employ simple building <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> in the construction of mission structures. Since importing the quantity of materials necessary for a large mission complex was impossible, the padres had to gather the materials they needed from the land around them. Five basic materials were used in constructing the permanent mission structures: adobe, timber, stone, brick, and tile. Adobes (mud bricks) were made from a combination of earth and water, with chaff, straw, or manure added to bind the mixture together. Occasionally pieces of bricks or shells were placed in the mix to improve the cohesiveness. The soil used may have been clay, loam, or sandy or gravelly earth. The making of the bricks was a simple process, derived from methods originally developed in Spain and Mexico. A convenient, level spot was chosen near the intended building site and close to a suitable water supply (usually a spring or creek). The ground was dug up and soaked with water, whereupon bare-legged workers would stomp the wet earth and binders into a [...] consistency fit for carrying to, and placing in, the brick molds.|$|E
