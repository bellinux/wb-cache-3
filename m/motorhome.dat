5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand <b>motorhome,</b> ending in Homer, where she parked the <b>motorhome</b> at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Norberto Fontana {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber <b>motorhome</b> and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve if they were in a position to do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship.|$|E
5|$|Villeneuve {{was born}} in Richelieu, a small town just outside Montreal, in the largely French-speaking {{province}} of Quebec in Canada {{and grew up in}} Berthierville. In 1970, he married Joann Barthe, with whom he had two children, Jacques and Mélanie. During his early career Villeneuve took his family on the road with him in a <b>motorhome</b> during the racing season, a habit which he continued to some extent during his Formula One career. He often claimed to have been born in 1952. By the time he got his break in Formula One, he was already 27 years old and took two years off his age to avoid being considered too old to make it at the highest level of motorsports.|$|E

5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a <b>motorhome,</b> though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the <b>motorhome</b> of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E

50|$|Airstream-badged Class A <b>motorhomes</b> {{began as}} 24- and 28-foot (7.3 and 8.5-m) models in 1979, {{and in the}} 1980s and 1990s, models ranging from 25 up to 37 feet (7.6 up to 11.2 m) were marketed. The {{aluminum}} <b>motorhomes</b> were followed by more traditional-looking fiberglass models in the 1990s. Airstream discontinued manufacture of Class A <b>motorhomes</b> in 2006.

500|$|Keene's {{career as}} the [...] "Eagle Lady" [...] began {{shortly after her}} arrival in Homer, when one morning she noticed two bald eagles on the beach near her <b>motorhome.</b> Keene saw {{offering}} food to the eagles as {{a natural extension of}} her practice of keeping bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds for wild songbirds. She began to bring home surplus fish in a bucket from her job, and each morning would throw some fish to the eagles over the short driftwood fence she had made around her <b>motorhome.</b> By the end of that spring, a half-dozen eagles were showing up for breakfast. The eagles departed with the arrival of summer, when the Spit became more active with human visitors, but they returned in the winter when tourist season had ended, and Keene resumed the daily feeding.|$|E
500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her <b>motorhome,</b> [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her <b>motorhome</b> to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My <b>motorhome</b> smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the last}} two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury Blue Bird <b>motorhome</b> on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near Creston, California. He {{remained}} in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so, where. He spent his time [...] "writing and researching", according to a spokesperson, and pursued photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals. He repeatedly redesigned the property, spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter-mile horse-racing track with an observation tower, which reportedly was never used.|$|E
50|$|GMC <b>motorhomes</b> in good {{condition}} and in proper tune are as efficient as similarly powered modern <b>motorhomes,</b> despite the use of computer-controlled engines on the latter, and typically see 9 to 11 miles per US gallon (21 to 26 L/100 km; 11 to 13 mpg-imp) of regular unleaded fuel.

The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the South Congress district of Austin, on June 21, 1986. According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The Drag in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his <b>motorhome</b> to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs. In May and June 1990, he opened for the Cowboy Junkies during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans.
