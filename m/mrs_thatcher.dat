5|$|The Rooms {{were opened}} to the public by <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> on 4 April 1984, in a {{ceremony}} attended by Churchill family members and former Cabinet War Rooms staff. At first the Rooms were administered by the museum on behalf of Department for the Environment; in 1989 responsibility was transferred to the Imperial War Museum.|$|E
25|$|A large London {{demonstration}} {{against the}} poll tax on 31 March 1990 — {{the day before}} it was introduced in England and Wales — turned into a riot. Millions of people resisted paying the tax. Opponents of the tax banded together to resist bailiffs and disrupt court hearings of poll tax debtors. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> refused to compromise, or change the tax, and its unpopularity was {{a major factor in}} Thatcher's downfall.|$|E
25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E
500|$|Considering it a {{waste of}} rate payer's money, Thatcher's {{government}} was keen to abolish the GLC and devolve control to the Greater London boroughs, stating its intention {{to do so in}} its 1983 electoral manifesto. Secretary of State for Employment Norman Tebbit lambasted the GLC as [...] "Labour-dominated, high-spending and at odds with the government's view of the world"; Livingstone commented that there was [...] "a huge gulf between the cultural values of the GLC Labour group and everything that <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> considered right and proper." [...] The government felt confident that there was sufficient opposition to Livingstone's administration that they could abolish the GLC: according to a MORI poll in April 1983, 58% of Londoners were dissatisfied and 26% satisfied with Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|Benn {{asserted}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a [...] "radical political importance" [...] on his life, and made {{a distinction between the}} historical Jesus as [...] "a carpenter of Nazareth" [...] who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and [...] "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a [...] "great mistake" [...] to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was [...] "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx". Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. [...] "I've never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church", Benn said to the Catholic Herald. [...] "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now – well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell." [...] According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman, Benn [...] "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus". Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as [...] "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was [...] "a Christian agnostic" [...] who believed [...] "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of [...] "humanist".|$|E

2500|$|The {{ideology}} Forman {{referred to}} was the fashionable combination of supply side economics, monetarism and privatisation {{known in the}} 1980s as Thatcherism. [...] After <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> was forced from office in late 1990 it was considered {{only a matter of}} time before Forman would be promoted.|$|E
2500|$|Squire {{was born}} and raised in South West London. After {{qualifying}} as an accountant he was employed by a finance company while being a Conservative Party activist. He became a member of Sutton Borough Council in 1968 and the Member of Parliament for Hornchurch in 1979. During the Thatcher years (1979 to 1990) Squire was considered to be a prominent [...] "wet", opposed to the Conservative government's economic and employment policies. After <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> left office in 1990, Squire's political position strengthened and he held junior ministerial positions until the Conservative government fell in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1981 Cabinet reshuffle, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> {{appointed}} Tebbit as Employment Secretary. This {{was seen}} as a shift to a 'tougher' approach to the trade unions than had been the case under Tebbit's predecessor, James Prior. Tebbit introduced the Employment Act 1982 which raised the level of compensation for those unfairly dismissed from a closed shop and prohibited closed shops unless 80% of relevant workers approved the arrangement in periodic ballots. It also removed trade unions' immunity from liability in tort- i.e. made trade unions liable for civil damages if they committed unlawful acts, and made injunctions possible against such acts. In his memoirs Tebbit said that the 1982 Act was his [...] "greatest achievement in Government".|$|E
2500|$|By 1982, {{the latent}} strains in his {{relationship}} with <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> became fully apparent. She complained that he was dismissive of the obstacles she was encountering in dismantling the legacy of decades of socialism, while he berated her for betraying the promise of her early years. After his exclusion from her inner circle she nevertheless continued to regard him with [...] "exasperated affection", and rewarded him with a knighthood in 1983. Yet in the 1990s he said of her, [...] "Lady Thatcher is great theatre as long as someone else is writing her lines; she hasn't got a clue". In July 2005 they were reunited at a reception marking the publication of Sherman's last book with a revealing title, Paradoxes of Power: Reflections on the Thatcher Interlude.|$|E
2500|$|During a hustings for the GMB Union on 7 June, McDonnell {{was asked}} what single act he would do to improve the world if he could travel back to the 1980s. His off-the-cuff reply was that [...] "I was on the GLC that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> abolished, I worked for the NUM {{and we had the}} NUM strike, I think I would assassinate Thatcher". Conservative MP Conor Burns told the BBC that [...] " [...] very distasteful" [...] and [...] "a very silly remark". McDonnell told the BBC: [...] "I'm sorry if I have caused offence to anyone. It was a joke and in that {{audience}} it was taken as a joke... it was taken out of context, I can see if people are upset about that and if I have caused offence to anyone of course I apologise".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, in {{preparation}} for privatisation, Post Office Telephones was rebranded as British Telecom (BT). In February 1981, {{it was announced that}} all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow, which was BT's new corporate colour. There was an immediate public outcry; the Daily Mail launched a campaign [...] "against the yellow peril" [...] and questions were asked in Parliament. In the House of Lords, the Earl of Gowrie, the Minister of State for Employment, called on BT [...] "to abandon this ridiculous scheme". In the House of Commons, Mark Lennox-Boyd MP asked the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, if she would treat the decision [...] "with the greatest possible dismay". <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher,</b> who was responsible for the privatisation, would only say that she could [...] "see my honourable Friend's point". Shortly afterwards, BT announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours [...] "as an experiment" [...] and that no final decision had been reached.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1983, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> {{appeared}} on Nationwide, a live television show on BBC1, where a teacher, Diana Gould, , {{saying that the}} ship was already west of the Falklands and heading towards the Argentinian mainland to the west. Gould {{also said that the}} Peruvian peace proposal must have reached London in the 14 hours between its publication and the sinking of General Belgrano, and the escalation of the war could have thus been prevented. In the emotional exchange that followed, Thatcher answered that the vessel was a threat to British ships and lives and denied that the peace proposal had reached her. She added that [...] "One day, all of the facts, in about 30 years time, will be published", apparently a reference to a classified report prepared by intelligence officer Major David Thorp for Thatcher after the incident. Diana Gould died in December 2011, just {{a few weeks before the}} existence of the report was made public.|$|E
2500|$|Jack Straw, former Foreign Secretary, was famously President of Leeds University Union in 1967-68. [...] Whilst President, Straw {{played a}} role in taking over the {{leadership}} of a student sit-in (which he had initially opposed) in June 1968. [...] In 2000, a motion was passed at the LUU Annual General Meeting strongly criticising Straw, then Home Secretary, for his part in the Asylum and Immigration Bill, the attempted removal of trial by jury (for some defendants) and legal aid in many cases, the anti-terrorism bill, the curfew on teenagers, mandatory drug testing for criminal suspects, and his attitude towards cannabis and tuition fees. Simon Rothstein, who proposed the motion, noted that the organisations that have condemned Straw included the Bar Council. He also pointed out that <b>Mrs</b> <b>Thatcher</b> had said, [...] "I trust Jack Straw. He is a very fair man." [...] The motion revoked Jack Straw's life membership of the union, banned him from the union building and called on the university to withdraw Straw's honorary degree.|$|E
2500|$|In the Cold War, Thatcher {{supported}} Ronald Reagan's {{policies of}} Rollback {{with the goal}} of reducing or ending Soviet Communist power. [...] This contrasted with the policy of détente which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies still wedded to the idea of détente. US forces were permitted by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> to station nuclear cruise missiles at British bases, arousing mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, declaring she liked him and [...] "We can do business together" [...] after a meeting three months before he came to power in 1985. This was a start in swinging the West back to a new détente with the Soviet Union in his era, as it proved to be an indication that the Soviet regime's power was decaying. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and détente postures.|$|E
60|$|Rose sought {{opportunity}} to talk about <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> and Josephine.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> {{shook her}} head feebly and turned paler than ever.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> turned pale, {{and sank}} into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said: ...|$|E
60|$|Josie stopped {{astonished}} and startled for a moment, {{and then}} tip-toed {{out of the}} room like a burglar, and told <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> all about it.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher,</b> a tall thin woman, welcomed Rose in sober fashion, {{and led the}} {{way into}} the little parlor, which seemed {{incredibly}} elegant to the shy girl.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the long}} {{afternoon}} the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited Aunt Polly and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> {{and tried to}} comfort them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, [...] "Send more candles--and send food." [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.|$|E
6000|$|The {{matter was}} decided there. [...] "You {{send her to}} me, when she gets ready, and I'll have <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> look after her {{for a week or}} so, till we find her a place to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher.</b> Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy that's {{turned up}} missing. I reckon my Tom stayed {{at your house}} last night--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Rose, {{when you}} come to Madison you must come to our house. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> will be glad to see you." [...] She could not utter a word in thanks. After he had gone Rose turned to her father with a swift appeal.|$|E
60|$|Her good, {{vigorous}} blood {{built up}} her courage during the night, {{but she was}} hardly a sweet and lovable companion in the days which followed. She (temporarily) hated Josie and feared <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher.</b> Thatcher himself, however, was her savior, for she would surely have gone home {{had it not been}} for him.|$|E
6000|$|Rose {{felt for}} the first time the unusualness of this talk. All her life she had {{discussed}} such things with him, but on previous vacations she had not been conscious of its startling plainness, but now it came to her with a sudden hot flush--think of such talk being reported of her to the Doctor and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|But dazed {{as she was}} {{she kept}} her self-command, at least she kept silence and sat in sombre, almost sullen dejection amid it all. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> hardly knew what to think of her, but the Doctor comprehended her mood better for he had passed through such {{experiences}} himself. He talked to her {{for a few minutes}} about her plans, and then they went out to dinner.|$|E
60|$|Natural as {{was this}} thought, she hid {{it from her}} associates. Most women die with it unacknowledged, even to their own spoken thought. She would have been helped by talk with the Doctor, or at least with his wife. But there was a growing barrier between <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> and herself, and the Doctor did not seem the same good friend. She felt a change coming in the whole household.|$|E
60|$|A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to {{his senses}} and he {{saw that he had}} made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The {{children}} became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.|$|E
60|$|She sat silently {{while the}} rest moved about her. There was a certain dignity in this reserve, and both <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> and Josie were {{impressed}} by it. She was larger and handsomer than either of them and that gave her an advantage, though she did not realize that. She was comparing in swift, disparaging fashion her heavy boots with their dainty soft shoes, and wondering what {{she could do to}} escape from them.|$|E
6000|$|And then, in some way, {{she never}} knew exactly how, he talked away her {{bitterness}} and gave her hope and comfort. He advised about books, and said: [...] "And you'll need some little things which Bluff Siding doesn't keep. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> will drive you up town tomorrow {{and you can get}} what you need. Your father has deposited some money here to pay your expenses. I am going over to University Hill to make a call; perhaps you'd like to go." ...|$|E
60|$|Joe {{tried to}} remember, {{but was not}} sure he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took {{possession}} of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear {{that they were still}} in the cave! <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.|$|E
6000|$|Morning came, eventually, and by ten or {{eleven o'clock}} a giddy and rollicking company were {{gathered}} at Judge Thatcher's, {{and everything was}} ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferryboat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> said to Becky, was: ...|$|E
60|$|TUESDAY {{afternoon}} came, and waned to the twilight. The {{village of}} St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children {{had not been}} found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations, {{saying that it was}} plain the children could never be found. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.|$|E
6000|$|Early in the forenoon {{parties of}} jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the {{citizens}} continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked {{that had never been}} visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names [...] "BECKY & TOM" [...] had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Thatcher</b> recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.|$|E
