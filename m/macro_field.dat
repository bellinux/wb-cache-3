40|$|This study {{proposes a}} multi-field {{asymptotic}} homogenization {{for the analysis}} of thermo-piezoelectric materials with periodic microstructures. The effect of the microstructural heterogeneity is taken into account by means of periodic perturbation functions, which derive from the solution of non homogeneous recursive cell problems defined over the unit periodic cell. A strong coupling is present between the micro displacement field and the micro electric potential field, since the mechanical and the electric problems are fully coupled in the asymptotically expanded microscale field equations. The micro displacement, the electric potential, and the relative temperature fields have been related to the macroscopic quantities and to their gradients in the derived down-scaling relations. Average field equations of infinite order have been obtained and the closed form of the overall constitutive tensors has been determined for the equivalent first-order homogenized continuum. A formal solution of such equations has been derived by means of an asymptotic expansion of the <b>macro</b> <b>fields.</b> The accuracy of the proposed formulation is assessed in relation to illustrative examples of a bi-material periodic microstructure subjected to harmonic body forces, free charge densities, and heat sources, whose periodicity is much greater than the characteristic microstructural size.

This model was {{proposed}} to describe the high order optical nonlinearities, and the low density free electron plasma generated by a laser pulse propagating in a gas. The MASP model is based on nonasymptotic, ab-initio equations, and accurately uses self-consistent description of micro (quantum) - and <b>macro</b> (<b>field)</b> - variables. However, its major drawback is a high computational cost, which in practice means that only short propagation lengths can be calculated. In order to reduce this cost, we study the MASP models enriched by a macroscopic evolution equation for polarization, from its simplest version in a form of transport equation, to more complex nonlinear variants. We show that homogeneous transport equation is a more universal tool to simulate the high harmonic spectra at shorter times and/or at a lower computational cost, while the nonlinear equation could be useful for modeling the pulse profiles when the ionization level is moderate. The gain associated with the considered modifications of the MASP model, being expressed in reduction of computational time {{and the number of}} processors involved, is of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude...|$|E

40|$|Polymer based porous {{materials}} largely exhibit viscoelastic properties {{which is a}} consequence of the viscoelastic nature of the constituent solid. If the constitutive relation for the constituent solid is known, then it is of interest to investigate how this constitutive relation of the solid at the microscale influences the macroscopic properties of the porous structure. In the present work porous structures are studied with the assumption that the constitutive solid is isotropic and that it also exhibits non-proportional damping characteristics. Non-proportional damping here refers to the dissimilarity in the frequency dependencies of the different complex elastic moduli of the constituent solid. Two different kinds of porous structures are investigated: pseudo random periodic microstructure and the other a pseudo random non-periodic microstructure. Both the structures are based on the implementation of Voronoi tessellations in 2 D Euclidean space. A representative volume element(RVE) or a unit cell approach is adapted to analyse the properties of the porous structure. Periodic boundary conditions are implemented on the RVE in case of the periodic microstructure while a less elegant approach of using a large enough element size and measuring the stress strain fields at the interior boundaries is adapted for the non-periodic structure. A direct homogenisation technique based on the volume averaging of the micro stress and strain fields is used to estimate the macro level stress and strain <b>fields.</b> These <b>macro</b> <b>fields</b> are then used for determining the complex elastic moduli of the porous frame structures. Finally the results reveal that in spite of the assumption of non-proportional damping for the constituent solid, the porous frame structure exhibits proportional damping for structures of high porosity, thus possibly justifying the assumptions of proportional damping for a porous structure with sufficiently high porosity...|$|R

40|$|The {{brain and}} its {{vast network of}} neurons is {{primarily}} considered purely {{from the perspective of}} how action potentials and neurotransmitters propagate signals. However, this view is limiting as it does not account for the impact of the electric fields that oscillate throughout the brain. These fields have traditionally been ignored because the fields from individual neurons are small and considered negligible. However, groups of neurons form clusters and their aggregate field effects are not negligible, just as a group of antennas in a phased array have significantly more transmission power than any one antenna in the array. In phased antenna arrays, the synchrony of the array elements is critical to combining the fields from the component antennas to create and steer a beam. In the neural world, the <b>macro</b> <b>field</b> oscillations due to the synchronicity of neural networks has been of great research interest, but models that explain the underpinnings of this synchronization are lacking. This work proposes a two-part model for explaining the establishment and maintenance of synchronicity in neural networks (the Ad-Hoc Connectedness Model for Neural Networks), based on unifying the results from prior research. First, plastic neural networks are greedily optimizing decentralized (ad-hoc) networks that dynamically adjust synaptic links based on a perceived usefulness for the respective links. Second, the handshaking signals used to encode the perceived utility for links are sensitive to even weak electric fields, and therefore the electric fields can modulate these greedily optimized networks. ...|$|E

Those induced cracking along with increased permeability, shall be taken into account in safety assessment of deep geological disposal. Ultrasonic survey and monitoring experiments have been performed in the Underground Research Laboratory of Meuse/Haute-Marne to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} extension and evolution of this damage. Ultrasonic devices have been deployed around shaft, gallery, slot and borehole to characterize the initiation, the extension and the level of the EDZ, P-wave velocity being very sensitive to the mechanical rock perturbations. The analysis of spatial and temporal velocity field changes gave reliable information on the cracks characteristics of the especially about their opening or their preferential orientation. The results provided by an ultrasonic device around shaft mine by test highlighted the initialization and extension of the damage as the shaft front proceeded. They also showed a polarisation of the velocity field and an oscillation of the transversal isotropy with a preferential orientation of the stress release and the microcracking. Otherwise, with a new automatic and ultrasonic probe, we have found around a borehole that the damage zone extends up to 0. 175 diameter of depth with an anisotropic damage pattern oriented according to the regional stress field (Figure 1). Nevertheless, the evolution of this damaged zone is still not well known at longer term, particularly under the influence of parameters such as the reconfining rock in contact with a rigid concrete surface. Is it possible that cracks close up significantly toward their seal? Induced mechanical perturbations are in this case much weaker than those generated by the excavation itself. A new ultrasonic experiment has been designed to be more sensitive to the frequency modulation of the P and S-wave sources. The purpose is to determine on site the dynamic elastic stiffness and the corresponding crack density tensors change before and during the resaturation and reconfining of the damaged and undamaged excavation vicinit...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{tries to}} resolve the {{unbalanced}} relationship between the “power, responsibility, and interests” of local debt in China, {{which is on the}} view of the power endowment, the responsibility restriction, and the interest transformation. The goal is to afford some lessons to control the local debt risk in China. However, to operate the above mechanisms, it depends on the safeguard which is formed by the institution perfection and the policy adjustment in the <b>macro</b> <b>field.</b> In practical terms, the first one is to ensure the legal basis for the debt power and responsibility. The power is the operation start and the responsibility is the code of conduct. In case of missing the restriction to the power and responsibility, the debt will be expanded as it is much harder to shake off the erosion of private benefit. Thus, the legal norm must be established for carrying the power and responsibility of the local debt, which is really the way in favor of the functional running of the debt management mechanism. The second one is to change the idea of the local officers as for the achievement assessment. As far as debt management is concerned, to help change this idea, try to consider some indicators of the local debt cost with spillovers into the examination system, which involve the debt efficiency, the debt risk, and so on. The purpose is to make local government have the sense of the debt responsibility while developing the economy. The third one is to guarantee basic financing for improving local development. For some factors such as the political system the local government can hardly provide enough money, the financial gap will be more serious, and the demand to the debt will become more urgent as well. The more serious this gap, the easier it is to cover up the irrational and irregular behavior of debt financing. So try to establish and perfect the basic financing safeguard mechanism at all levels of government, to eliminate any possibility of the local debt financing blindly. The next one is to set up a budget system to manage the local debt. From the consideration, the governments at all levels should have more emphasis on how to build a budget system meeting the requirements of the modern budget system. One of the important reasons is that only by bringing the local debt into the budget management can the scale be controlled effectively and be managed regularly. In a further step, this will lead the continuous debt expansion and then make a threat to the financial, monetary, and economic security in the whole country. The last one is to enhance the information disclosure mechanism of the local debt. If there is a large amount of non-transparent information about local debt, it would bring about many of them being outside the statistics and kept in the invisible position. The more important is the behavior about the relevant debt power is difficult to supervise and control. As a result, it is necessary to establish a perfect mechanism to disclose the information of the local debt, which needs to improve the accounting system, strengthen the auditing mechanism, and regulate the system of statistical management and so on.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>field</b> <b>macro</b> {{experiment}} {{which has}} been carried out in locality of “Bosevica” on alluvial soil type has been investigated weed vegetation with rice grown in precrop of some fodder plants (a mixed forage crop). The variants in the experiments were the following: I – precrop of forage pea (Pisum sativum ssp. arvense L.), II - for-age pea (Pisum sativum ssp. arvense L.) + wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar “babuna”), III – chickling (Vicia vilosa L.) and IV-control (continuous cropping sistem). According to the obtained results it has been ascertained that the average number of weeds per m^ 2 of Echinchloa spp., Heteranthera limosa (Sw) Wild and Leersia orizoides in variants I, II and III significantly decreased compared to the control, where as that of Cyperus spp. and Scirpus maritimus is bigger. Weed density compared to control (100...|$|R

Focusing on the Nizam/Selamet Movement, this dissertation studies why and {{how there}} are variations in the political engagement patterns of “moderate” Islamist movements operating within the same institutional/political context. Specifically, covering a period from the 1960 s through the 1970 s, this study examines {{why and how}} the Nizam/Selamet Movement emerged and established a political party; produced goals and ideational elements distinct from contemporary and past Islamist movements in Turkey and showed considerable flexibility in its choice of allies, strategies and policies, including formation of a coalition government with the archenemy of the Islamists, the Republican People’s Party. Drawing on the Nizam/Selamet case, this study argues that Islamist movements are complex social phenomena that emerge and survive through an incremental process entailing interacting, complex and even undetermined sets of cognitive, relational and environmental factors. The answer to the research question thus lies in unearthing these configurations through descending {{up and down the}} <b>macro</b> (political <b>field),</b> meso (network and organization) and micro (properties and trajectories of the movement elites and activists) echelons at both national and local levels of the political field and the movement. A historical dimension is also necessary to highlight intra- and extra-movement factors at different life phases of the movement (accumulated resources and inherited constraints), which shape the form and substance of its political engagement; and to take into consideration the influence of one stage over the other.
