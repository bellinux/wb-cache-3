40|$|Fiscal {{federalism}} {{implies a}} challenge of holding fiscal discipline {{at the local}} level. Recent analyses of fiscal adjustment have addressed the design of fiscal and political institutions for the U. S. states, and have shown how tax limits and anti-deficit rules strengthen immediate shock adjustment. Here we extend the evidence {{to the case of}} centralized financing in Norway. In this system central government takes a larger responsibility in smoothing decentralized government revenue, {{but at the same time}} the localities are more vulnerable to shocks because of their limited room to maneuver. The empirical analysis of responses to budgetary shocks shows that local public investment is the <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> in this system and that investments are procyclical.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal scal policy {{adjustment}} to adverse {{terms of trade}} shocks by commodity-producing countries within a general equilibrium model,which allows for explicit distinction between public investment and government consumption. As the private sector has limited room for maneuver in correcting the shock itself, the public sector is used to isolate the economy from external fluctuations. The ability of fiscal policy to shield the economy from external shocks critically depends on instruments available to government. In the presence of international capital market imperfections, the shock is absorbed primarily {{through a combination of}} reduced expenditure and higher taxes. Cuts in expenditure are carried out mostly through cuts in public investment, with the change in the levelof public investment being about ten times larger than the change in government consumption. Public investment is thus the <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> in this situation and is highly pro-cyclical. In the absence of distortions on the international capital markets, government shifts from domestic sources to external sources to absorb the shock and resorts to increased external borrowing to finance the shortfall in revenues. In this case, responses of both public investment and government consumption are more smoothed and less pro-cyclical, whereas tax rate falls. fiscal policy, adjustment, external shocks, commodity-producing countries...|$|E
5000|$|The December 29 {{accident}} {{was the second}} runway overrun involving a Red Wings operated Tu-204-100B in nine days. A Moscow Vnukovo to Novosibirsk flight on December 20, 2012 overran runway 25 at Tolmachevo Airport by 1,150 feet (350 meters) when its brakes failed on landing. As {{a result of that}} incident, on December 24 the Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia (Rosaviatsia) issued a mandatory Airworthiness Directive requiring Red Wings and all other operators of the Tu-204 to inspect and apply extra lubrication to the braking system drive mechanism limit switches, located on the <b>main</b> landing <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> [...] "before next departure". On December 28, the day before the fatal Vnukovo accident, Rosaviatsia also formally notified Tupolev, the aircraft's manufacturer, that malfunctioning brakes had caused the Red Wings Tu-204 overrun accident at Novosibirsk. On December 30 Rosaviatsia chief Alexander Neradko announced that a preliminary examination of the aircraft's flight data recorder indicated that the flight had touched down in the proper landing area but, as in the December 20 incident in Novosibirsk, the braking system on RA-64047 appeared to have failed in the fatal Moscow overrun accident as well.|$|R
