5000|$|Unlike {{elemental}} boron whose combustion {{is incomplete}} through the glassy oxide layered impeding oxygen diffusion, magnesium diboride burns completely when ignited in oxygen or in mixtures with oxidizers. Thus <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> {{has been proposed}} as fuel in ram jets,. In addition the use of MgB2 in blast-enhanced explosives [...] and propellants has been proposed for the same reasons. Most recently it could be shown that decoy flares containing magnesium diboride/Teflon/Viton display 30-60% increased spectral efficiency, Eλ (J g−1sr−1), compared to classical Magnesium/Teflon/Viton(MTV) payloads.|$|E

In the temperature range explored (883 – 1154 K), <b>magnesium</b> <b>borides</b> are observed to decompose by loss of gaseous Mg only. The equilibrium pressures of Mg(g) have been measured during high-temperature decompositions involving MgB 2 /MgB 4 and MgB 4 /MgB 7 two-phase mixtures and the corresponding standard reaction enthalpies were determined.

40|$|With the {{motivation}} of searching for new superconductors in the Mg-B system, we performed ab initio evolutionary searches for all the stable compounds in this binary system in the pressure range of 0 - 200 GPa. We found previously unknown, yet thermodynamically stable, compositions MgB_ 3 and Mg_ 3 B_ 10. Experimentally known MgB_ 2 is stable in the entire pressure range 0 - 200 GPa, while MgB_ 7 and MgB_ 12 are stable at pressures below 90 GPa and 35 GPa, respectively. We predict a reentrant behavior for MgB_ 4, which becomes unstable against decomposition into MgB_ 2 and MgB_ 7 at 4 GPa and then becomes stable above 61 GPa. We find ubiquity of phases with boron sandwich structures analogous to the AlB_ 2 -type structure. However, {{with the exception of}} MgB_ 2, all other <b>magnesium</b> <b>borides</b> have low electron-phonon coupling constants λ of 0. 32 to 0. 39 and are predicted to have T_c below 3 K.

40|$|Multivalence is {{identified}} in the light element, B, through structure morphology. Boron sheets exhibit highly versatile valence, and the layered boron materials may hold {{the promise of a}} high-energy-density magnesium-ion battery. Practically, boron is superior to previously known multivalence materials, especially transition metal compounds, which are heavy, expensive, and often not benign. Based on density functional theory simulations, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have predicted a series of stable <b>magnesium</b> <b>borides,</b> MgB{sub x}, with a broad range of stoichiometries, 2 < x < 16, by removing magnesium atoms from MgB{sub 2 }. The layered boron structures are preserved through an in-plane topological transformation between the hexagonal lattice domains and the triangular domains. The process can be reversibly switched as the charge transfer changes with Mg insertion/extraction. The mechanism of such a charge-driven transformation originates from the versatile valence state of boron in its planar form. The discovery of these new physical phenomena suggests the design of a high-capacity magnesium-boron battery with theoretical energy density 876 mAh/g and 1550 Wh/L...|$|R
50|$|Aluminum <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> or BAM is a {{chemical}} compound of aluminium, magnesium and boron. Whereas its nominal formula is AlMgB14, the chemical composition {{is closer to}} Al0.75Mg0.75B14. It is a ceramic alloy that is highly resistive to wear and has a low coefficient of sliding friction, reaching a record value of 0.02 in lubricated AlMgB14−TiB2 composites.

The influence of number of ECAE passes on MgB 2 PITs was also analyzed in terms of microstructure, density and mechanical properties. MgB 2 PITs with iron tube were processed up to six ECAE passes. X-ray analysis of the compacts showed no other phases, other than MgO, in MgB 2 compacts even after large mechanical working and annealing. Simple shear stresses predominant in ECAE constantly rendered compaction of the hard brittle MgB 2 powders. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} a ternary <b>magnesium</b> nickel <b>boride</b> (MgNi_(2. 5) B_ 2) mixed with LiH and MgH_ 2 can be {{hydrogenated}} reversibly forming LiBH_ 4 and Mg_ 2 NiH_ 4 at temperatures below 300 °C. The ternary boride was prepared by sintering a mechanically milled mixture of MgB_ 2 and Ni precursors at 975 °C under inert atmosphere. Hydrogenation of the ternary, milled with LiH and MgH_ 2, was performed under 100 to 160 bar H_ 2 at temperatures up to 350 °C. Analysis using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and ^(11) B magic angle spinning NMR {{confirmed that the}} ternary boride was hydrogenated forming borohydride anions. The reaction was reversible with hydrogenation kinetics that improved over three cycles.

40|$|Among the borohydrides {{proposed}} for solid state hydrogen storage, Ca(BH 4) 2 is particularly interesting {{because of its}} favourable thermodynamics and relatively cheap price. Composite systems, where other species are present {{in addition to the}} borohydride, show some advantages in hydrogen sorption properties with respect to the borohydrides alone, despite a reduction of the theoretical storage capacity. We have investigated the milling time influence on the sorption properties of the CaH 2 + MgB 2 system from which Ca(BH 4) 2 and MgH 2 can be synthesized by hydrogen absorption process. Manometric and calorimetric measurements showed better kinetics for long time milled samples. We found that the total substitution of MgB 2 with AlB 2 in the starting material can improve the sorption properties significantly, while the co-existence of both <b>magnesium</b> and aluminum <b>borides</b> in the starting mixture did not cause any improvement. Rietveld refinements of the X-ray powder diffraction spectra were used to confirm the hypothesized reactions...|$|R
40|$|An electron-counting {{strategy}} {{starting from}} <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> {{was used to}} show the inevitability of hexagonal holes in 2 D borophene. The number (hole density, HD) and distribution of the hexagonal holes determine the binding energy per boron atom in monolayer borophenes. The relationship between binding energy and HD changes dramatically when the borophene is placed on a Ag(111) surface. The distribution of holes in borophenes on Ag(111) surfaces depends on the temperature. DFT calculations show that aside from the previously reported S 1 and S 2 borophene phases, other polymorphs may also be competitive. Plots of the electron density distribution of the boron sheets suggest that the observed STM image of an S 2 phase corresponds to a sheet with a HDof 2 / 15 instead of a sheet witha HDof 1 / 5. The hole density and the hole distribution echo the distribution of vacancies and extra occupancies in complex beta-rhombohedral boron...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study powder in tubes (PITs) are {{processed}} through single pass equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), for two different powders by using three different tube materials. Studies were conducted {{for the first time}} to understand the processing mechanism of ECAE of PITs. In the case of hard brittle intermetallic <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> (MgB 2) powder, the process was found to primarily involve compaction and shear-sliding of the powder, and localized-deformation of the tube. Reasons for localized-deformation occurring during ECAE were discussed in detail. Compaction efficiency was understood to depend not only on the material of the tube but also on the homogeneity of stress and strain in the composite PIT. Various frictional stresses and mechanisms of localized-deformation were found to be the reasons for stress-strain inhomogeneity. In the case of copper powder, even though localized-deformation occurred, higher inter-particle friction and low yield strength of the powder helped in the complete densification of the powders...|$|E
40|$|Graphene, carbon onions, and {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes {{have been}} chemically synthesised {{through a variety}} of novel pathways. Graphene was synthesised in gram-scale quantities by a bottom-up wet chemical approach involving a solvothermal process. Purification methods of the chemically synthesised graphene were investigated along with the physical properties of the material. High surface areas and long range anti-ferromagnetic behaviour was identified in the synthesised graphene. The graphene was incorporated into superconducting <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride,</b> and nano-sized silicon particles in battery devices. The graphene based composite materials showed enhanced properties to that of the parent materials. Gram-scale quantities of carbon onions were obtained by a simple combustion method involving a polyaromatic hydrocarbon. The synthesis provided insights into the formation of carbon nanostructures. Carbon onion coatings on glass were found to be superhydrophobic. Solvothermal conditions were used to synthesise very large multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Through a set of interdependent reactions involving lithium metal and polytetrafluoroethylene, it was shown that the formation of carbon nanotubes could be controlled. Under ambient pressures, multi-walled carbon nanotubes were also synthesised by the reaction of sodium metal and carbon tetrachloride...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} study, we demonstrated that <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> nanotubes {{can reach the}} same stability as bulk MgB 2 structure. However, most stable nanotubular forms are not structurally derived from mixed triangular-hexagonal structural motifs of a single layer sheet, which {{is thought to be}} the 2 D precursor form of all boron nanotubes. MgB 2 multiwall nanotubular structures that are derived from multilayer MgB 2 slabs with honeycomb B-networks in hexagonal lattices are more stable. The results of an ab initio study of multilayer slabs of MgB 2 show that a 25 -layer slab approaches the stability of bulk MgB 2. The critical parameter of the corresponding multiwall nanotubes is the inner diameter; the calculated value is ~ 32. 6 nm, which is independent of the number of walls. The outer diameters of 25 -wall nanotubes are ~ 51 nm, and terminal Mg atoms are located on the outer surfaces of the nanotubes. The electronic band structures of MgB 2 -multiwall nanotubes (MgB 2 MWNT) correspond to the band structure character and topology of superconducting bulk MgB 2. The results confirm that the quasi- 1 D superconductor MgB 2 MWNT is a stable structure and can be synthesized...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{interest}} in hydrogen-storage materials as an alternative high-efficiency and safe, green energy carriers is steadily increasing. Among numerous hydrides scrutinized for the purpose over the past 10 - 15 years, aluminum- and magnesium-based systems attract continued attention, mainly because of their high gravimetric capacity and low cost. However, difficulties associated with facile synthesis and hence the reversibility, relatively high desorption temperatures, and sluggish kinetics {{in many of these}} systems are still of great concern and hold them back from broad, large-scale applications, e. g. in automotive industry. Our research was devoted to studies of mechanochemical activation and synthesis of nanostructured hydride systems of aluminum and magnesium by solid-state mechanical milling techniques. The structural and desorption properties of milled powders were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and desorption analysis in a Sieverts-type apparatus. The primary focus {{of this study was to}} investigate a number of aluminum-based hydride systems to develop advanced synthesis procedures for AlH 3 (alane) using solvent-free solid-state mechanical milling under moderate hydrogen pressures at room temperature. The findings reported in this dissertation, may provide the much needed basic scientific insight necessary for the development of an approach for direct mechanochemical hydrogenation of metallic aluminum which still remains elusive despite numerous efforts worldwide. Here, we have demonstrated a mechanochemical approach for synthesis of alane via metathesis reactions between hydride sources and aluminum halides. Reaction pathways and parameters controlling the reactions were investigated. Additionally, the possibility of mechanochemical hydrogenation of <b>magnesium</b> <b>boride</b> (MgB 2) was also studied...|$|E

The {{configuration of the}} formal of [ [...] . ]- 2, 3 -butanediol has been established unequivocally by reactions of the diol under basic conditions with methylene iodide, methylene chloride, and chloromethyl acetate. The products are optically active, are alike, and {{are the same as}} the one obtained in the acid-catalyzed reaction of the glycol with formaldehyde. II. The coloration of sodium chloride by white x-radiation has been separated into two distinct types. The intense color at the surface involves the creation of new anionic vacancies by longwave radiation; aggregate color centers result from optical or thermal bleaching. The less intense coloration throughout the crystal is due to the short-wave radiation; no new vacancies are created and no secondary coloration occurs. Plastic deformation does not affect the overall colorability but greatly enhances the secondary coloration effects. Tentative mechanisms for these processes are discussed. Studies of the secondary radiative coloration, the so-called colloidal band in additively colored crystals, and the color of blue rocksalt have led to the suggestion that these color centers are members of a continuous series of F center aggregates. The possibility of a true colloidal dispersion in additively colored sodium chloride has been investigated by comparison of these crystals with sodium chloride, known to contain colloidal copper. Crystals of sodium chloride have been grown containing heavy metal ion impurities. Spectrophotometric studies have been made of these crystals before and after radiative and additive coloration. The ultraviolet absorption bands in the uncolored crystals have been tentatively explained in terms of V centers. X-radiation and bleaching destroys some of the absorption bands and creates others. III. An investigation of the strontium-zinc system, using x-ray diffraction techniques, has revealed four intermetallic phases. The compound SrZn 13, previously reported elsewhere, has been confirmed with respect to composition and symmetry. The second phase, SrZn 5, contains 24 atoms in its unit cell, is orthorhombic, and has been tentatively assigned the symmetry Pmnb. The third phase, SrZn 2, is also orthorhombic, and has 12 atoms in a body centered unit cell. No single crystals of the fourth phase have been isolated, but the composition has been shown to correspond approximately to Sr 3 Zn 2 or Sr 4 Zn 3. The structure of the [ [...] . ] phase has been worked out in detail.
