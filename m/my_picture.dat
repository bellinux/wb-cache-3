After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future.

[...] An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author: [...] "He knew he was different and that his music was good but I thought he was such a nasty character; always rude and quite vulgar." [...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word". Morrison's image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey again took a {{hands-on}} approach to MGM's products, personally ordering cuts on films. The New York Times Magazine wrote, [...] "Aubrey's heavy involvement with every creative detail of MGM's pictures far surpassed his immersal in CBS's scripts." [...] After he made edits {{to the film}} Going Home starring Robert Mitchum, its director, Herbert B. Leonard, protested publicly. [...] "He unilaterally and arbitrarily raped the picture," [...] he told Time in 1971. Director Blake Edwards was incensed by changes Aubrey made to his film The Wild Rovers with William Holden, telling The New York Times Magazine, [...] "Cuts? He doesn't {{know as much as}} a first-year cinema student. He cut the heart right out of it." [...] Television producer Bruce Geller, who created , had his name removed from the credits of his first film, Corky, because [...] "It's not <b>my</b> <b>picture</b> any more."

500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that <b>my</b> <b>picture</b> would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!" [...] Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by [...] "feeling some of them up inappropriately" [...] while frisking them.|$|E
500|$|In 1809 {{historian}} John Eliot called Wilson affable in speech, but condescending in his deportment. [...] An early mentor of his, Dr. William Ames, wrote, [...] "that if {{he might}} have his option of the best condition this side of heaven, it would be [...] the teacher of a congregational church of which Mr. Wilson was pastor." [...] Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton called him [...] "eminent for love and zeal" [...] and M'Clure wrote that his unfeigning modesty was excessive. [...] In this vein, M'Clure wrote that Wilson refused to ever sit for a portrait and his response to those who suggested he do so was [...] "What! Such a poor vile creature as I am! [...] Shall <b>my</b> <b>picture</b> be drawn? [...] I say No; it never shall." [...] M'Clure then suggested that the line drawing of Wilson in the Massachusetts Historical Society was made after his death. [...] Cotton Mather, the noted Puritan who was a grandson of both Richard Mather and John Cotton wrote of Wilson, [...] "If the picture of this good, and therein great man, were to be exactly given, great zeal, with great love, would be the two principal strokes that, joined with orthodoxy, should make up his portraiture." ...|$|E

Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know <b>my</b> <b>picture,</b> 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the campaign, a {{controversy}} arose when Barbour chose {{to speak at}} the Blackhawk Rally, a fundraiser for the Blackhawk [...] "council school" [...] in Blackhawk, Mississippi. Such [...] "council schools", also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as [...] "academies", were established by the White Citizens' Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the Civil Rights Movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that [...] "Once you start down the slippery slope of saying, 'That person can't be for me,' then where do you stop? ... I don't care who has <b>my</b> <b>picture.</b> My picture's in the public domain." [...] Barbour's Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk rallies.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish <b>my</b> <b>picture</b> when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E

" — Elliot Eisner (2003) When Matthew joined Penny Clare's 3 rd grade classroom midyear, the students {{were in the midst}} of crafting collage stories, inspired by the hand-painted papers they had created during an artists/writers workshop. Each student donated one hand-painted paper to Matthew and explained to him how to create his own collage story. The students then got into a heated debate. Alexander told Matthew that you could either make your pictures first, write your words first, or go back and forth between the two. Hannah, a two-year veteran of artists/writers workshop, disagreed: I always make <b>my</b> <b>pictures</b> first because then I can look at <b>my</b> <b>pictures</b> to help me with my describing words.
