5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} <b>mainmast</b> in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the <b>mainmast</b> and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was installed in a port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the <b>mainmast.</b> Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and <b>mainmast</b> had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and <b>mainmast</b> were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
50|$|A barque, barc, or bark {{is a type}} {{of sailing}} vessel with three or more masts having the fore- and <b>mainmasts</b> rigged square and only the mizzen (the aftmost mast) rigged fore-and-aft.|$|R
2500|$|The lower masts of both fore- and <b>mainmasts</b> {{are still}} standing, whereas the {{mizzenmast}} have healed over to starboard. The wreck was originally rigged as a ship, with square sails on fore and <b>mainmasts.</b> The [...] hull is about 20 m long and relatively wide. The stern is round tucked, which might indicate English shipbuilding style, {{rather than the}} Dutch. The hull has three gunports along each side. Two guns have been observed at the wrecksite. Due to its maneuverability and small size, such a ship would also have been suitable for piracy. The ship once had three masts, {{two of which are}} still standing. The beakhead was adorned with a figurehead {{in the shape of a}} lion.|$|R
50|$|Twice, {{after her}} repairs had been {{completed}} and {{as she was about}} to get underway, the frigate was kept in port by lightning-splintered <b>mainmasts.</b> Meanwhile, the ship, undermanned when she left Philadelphia, was losing more of her men from sickness, death, and desertion.|$|R
5|$|As far as is known, no radars were {{installed}} aboard Mutsu before her loss. While in drydock in May 1943, a Type 21 air-search radar was installed aboard Nagato {{on the roof}} of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface-search radars {{were installed}} on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her <b>mainmast.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her <b>mainmast</b> fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens <b>mainmast</b> also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Korall radar-jammers were {{mounted on}} either side of the <b>mainmast</b> as well as a Machta system on the foremast. Solentse-1P {{infrared}} detectors were carried {{on either side}} of the superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|E
5000|$|They {{carried a}} barque rig of sail on three masts, {{including}} {{a full set}} of studding sails on fore and <b>mainmasts.</b> [...] This rig enabled them to serve in areas where coaling stations were rare, and to rely on their sails for propulsion. That flexibility made them was well-suited to distant cruising service and trade protection for the British Empire.|$|R
5|$|The replica {{standing}} mizzen {{is built}} to this shorter measurement and stepped {{in the hold}} on the keelson, as is the model in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. There {{is a difference between}} the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of Earl of Pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and <b>mainmasts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and <b>mainmasts</b> be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|R
5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short <b>mainmast.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the <b>mainmast.</b> The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Illustrious was delayed {{two months to}} fit her with a Type 79Z early-warning radar; {{she was the first}} aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion. This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new <b>mainmast</b> {{to be added to the}} aft end of the island to mount the transmitter.|$|E
50|$|It {{was fitted}} with 3-cylinder {{compound}} engines with one high-pressure cylinder of 46 in diameter being {{flanked by two}} low-pressure cylinders of 64 in diameter. The bow above the waterline was nearly straight, in contrast to that of wooden sailing ships. It had stern galleries, similar to older frigates, but the ports were false, {{and there were no}} quarter galleries. Boats were carried both amidships and at the stern. Canada flew a barque or ship rig of sail on three masts, including studding sails on fore and <b>mainmasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pallister {{served as}} a Shoreham police officer {{responsible}} for beach patrol. In 1937, he rescued passengers of a yawl that went adrift on Long Island Sound during an intense thunderstorm. Strong winds from the storm had broken both <b>mainmasts</b> on the 25-foot ship during a journey from Mattituck, New York to Port Jefferson. This had left it floating haphazardly two miles from shore. After rowing a 12-foot dory (a lightweight rowboat) to the ship, Pallister threw its two passengers a connecting line. He then used his rowboat to tow the ship to shore.|$|R

5|$|The {{multiple}} explosions gutted the superstructure {{between the}} <b>mainmast</b> and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the <b>mainmast.</b> The ship's side between Frames 74 and 84 was ripped open {{down to the}} lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed. After {{it was estimated that}} it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair Iéna it was decided to decommission the ship and use her as a target ship. All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the Île des Porquerolles where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of armour-piercing shells beginning on 9 August 1909. After the completion of numerous tests, and with Iéna close to , she was towed to deeper water. While under tow Iéna capsized and sank on 2 December 1909. The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and salvaged between 1912 and 1927.|$|E
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, a Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on her <b>mainmast.</b>|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the <b>mainmast</b> on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5000|$|Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden had two {{horizontal}} return {{connecting rod}} compound steam engines, built by Lairds, each driving a single 15 ft propeller. The engines were powered by four square boilers. The engines produced {{a total of}} [...] which gave the ship a maximum speed of 12.09 kn during her sea trials. She carried 380 LT of coal and was barque-rigged with three masts. Her fore and <b>mainmasts</b> were supported by tripods to reduce interference with the firing arcs of the gun turrets by the ship's rigging. Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden had a total sail area of [...]|$|R
500|$|The control {{positions}} {{for the main}} armament were located in the spotting tops {{at the head of}} the fore and <b>mainmasts.</b> Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.|$|R

5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the <b>mainmast.</b> These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the <b>mainmast</b> on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her <b>mainmast</b> was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck to allow it to fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
2500|$|In the Comus class, the bow {{above the}} {{waterline}} was nearly straight, {{in contrast to}} that of wooden sailing ships. [...] The corvettes had stern galleries, similar to older frigates, but the ports were false, {{and there were no}} quarter galleries. [...] Boats were carried both amidships and at the stern. [...] The ships flew a barque or ship rig of sail on three masts, including studding sails on fore and <b>mainmasts.</b> The masts were stayed by shrouds which were anchored to chainplates affixed {{to the inside of the}} gunwales, rather than the exterior as in wooden sailing ships.

The guns fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of [...] at a rate of four rounds per minutes. At their maximum elevation of 15° they had a maximum range of about [...] The ship carried 150 rounds per gun.|$|R
5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} <b>mainmast.</b> She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} foremast with a pole <b>mainmast.</b> To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E
5|$|The Nagato {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was {{large enough to accommodate}} an electric elevator running between the foretop and main deck. In November 1944, the tops of Nagatos <b>mainmast</b> and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
2500|$|She was rigged as a barque (the fore- and <b>mainmasts</b> being square rig and the {{mizzen mast}} {{carrying}} a fore-aft sail) {{and the total}} maximum sail area was 12,296 square feet (1142 square metres). Following {{the practice of the}} most modern sailing ships of the time, the windjammers, she carried split topsails {{to reduce the size of}} the deck crew needed to handle them. The ship was rigged to carry several large staysails and the funnel was hinged at the base so it could be laid on the deck when the large mizzen staysail was rigged once at sea. The Discovery was marginally faster under sail than she was under engine - her record for distance travelled in 24 hours is 223 nautical miles (358km), equivalent to 9.2 knots (10.5mph, 17km/h)> ...|$|R
50|$|At the time, Britain {{was heavily}} {{dependent}} on flax (Linum usitatissimum) (for sails) and hemp (Cannabis sp.) (for ropes) from {{the shores of the}} Baltic Sea ports. Any threat to their supply endangered Britain's sea power. The UK also relied on timbers from New England for <b>mainmasts,</b> and these were not supplied after the American War of Independence. The alternative source of Norfolk Island for these, (or in the case of flax and hemp, similar) supplies is argued by some historians, notably Geoffrey Blainey in Tyranny of Distance, as being a major reason for the founding of the convict settlement of New South Wales by the First Fleet in 1788.James Cook said that, “except for New Zealand, in no other island in the South Sea was wood and mast-timber so ready to hand”.|$|R
50|$|Swiftsures {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} fourteen 50-calibre 7.5-inch Mk III guns. Ten {{of the guns}} were mounted in a central battery on the main deck; the other four were in casemates abreast the fore- and <b>mainmasts</b> on the upper deck. A major problem with the guns on the main deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship—only about 10 ft above water at deep load—and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather as they dipped their muzzles in the sea when rolling more than 14°. The guns fired 200 lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2781 ft/s at a rate of four rounds per minutes. At their maximum elevation of 15° they had a maximum range of about 14000 yd. The ship carried 150 rounds per gun.|$|R
