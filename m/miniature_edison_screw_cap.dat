40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine {{closures}} provide {{many benefits}} in maintenance of wine quality over time, however acceptance of their use by purchasers has varied. This work first investigates how factors like age, gender, income and education affect {{the decision to}} purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines {{and to what extent}} these factors impact consumer decisions to bring <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine to various social settings. The results of a questionnaire pooling attitudes and behaviors of wine purchasers (n= 319) indicate that factors such as age, wine knowledge, income and gender influence a consumerâ€™s decision to purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine. Education and income positively impact the acceptance of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines and the likelihood of purchasing them.

50|$|Compared to cork, <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{reduce the}} wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> bottle. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> are generally perceived as easier to open. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful.|$|R

40|$|In {{the wine}} closure {{industry}} cork remains the dominant bottle sealing technology with a {{market share of}} around 90 per cent. Our research analyses the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine seal's development and original introduction within Australia in the 1970 s. It identifies the fundamental reasons for its initial commercial failure. The Australian wine industry {{played a leading role}} in recognizing the commercial potential of a French prototype <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. Local piloting and testing occurred followed by a market launch. Unfortunately for <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> change agents, the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal was largely a failure. Rogers' (1995) innovation diffusion model identifies several underlying factors responsible for the customer's rejection of the new <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. In particular, these were the failure to effectively demonstrate the relative advantage of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal to consumers and to address the complexity and incompatibility of the seal with established user traditions. The industry was therefore unable to achieve a 'critical mass' of adoption. The additional application of Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model reveals that the failure of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> was also attributable to a lack of an effective industry marketing strategy that would overcome this identifiable consumer resistance. In particular, it lacked a strategy to manage the transition dynamics between the early and mainstream markets. We conclude that a theoretically informed {{understanding of the nature of}} the innovation and thus the adoption hurdles would have significantly aided the diffusion of this innovation...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> or [...] "Stelvin caps" [...] are {{closures}} {{made only}} from aluminium material that threads onto the bottleneck. They are the predominant closure used by Austrian, Australian and New Zealand wineries. This {{can be attributed}} {{in part to the}} New Zealand <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> initiative which promotes the use of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> instead of cork. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> form a tighter seal and can keep out oxygen for a longer time than cork. These benefits aid in maintaining the wine's overall quality and aging potential. Michel Laroche of Domaine Laroche noted that this played a role in his decision to adopt screwcaps. [...] "Extensive quality tests show convincing results: apart from protecting against cork taint, screwcaps are also beneficial in the aging of wine, particularly preserving the aromatic freshness." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{met with}} {{customer}} resistance in Australia and New Zealand, and were phased {{out in the}} early 1980s, only to be reintroduced gradually in the 1990s.
