5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see <b>me</b> <b>very</b> dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|You made <b>me</b> <b>very</b> low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes. Yours sincerely, Mary.|$|E

5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt <b>me</b> <b>very</b> much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes <b>me</b> <b>very</b> grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E

500|$|The {{committee}} professes to find <b>me</b> <b>very</b> {{useful in}} unravelling the conundrums sent {{down by the}} finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [...] and despairing, {{and now they have}} pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard <b>me</b> <b>very</b> patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{stated the}} use of her lower vocals on the tracks {{claiming}} that [...] "people weren't taking <b>me</b> <b>very</b> seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out.

[...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E

500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her head down on the table and talking to <b>me,</b> <b>very</b> flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E

[...] This fact does not impress <b>me</b> <b>very</b> much. [...] Lawyers have been trained to take either side of any case and make the most intelligent and impassioned defense of their adopted viewpoint." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{publicly}} supported Sinn Féin and {{the unification}} of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that {{to do so would}} recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: [...] "I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought that my mother would suddenly be a foreigner would upset <b>me</b> <b>very</b> much." ...|$|E
500|$|Barry Beyerstein - [...] "One of {{the many}} enjoyable tasks I {{undertake}} for CSICOP is to lecture in Ray Hyman's annual summer workshop at the University of Oregon. [...] Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower of my fellow faculty at work, {{it is also the}} people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' [...] They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it.

Kirschner previously appeared in two season four episodes [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] and [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land". Jen Ponton, who plays a Carvel employee who gets fired, said that the cast and crew of 30 Rock were [...] "wonderful to work with. Everyone was absolutely top-notch. The whole crew was very professional. They treated <b>me</b> <b>very</b> well". Ponton auditioned for her role in September and got the job within a few days.|$|E

[...] In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote [...] "My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead <b>me</b> <b>very</b> strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan, age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country." [...] An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
500|$|Britten {{was at the}} RCM from 1930 to 1933, {{studying}} composition with Ireland {{and piano}} with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students [...] "amateurish and folksy" [...] and the staff [...] "inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be [...] "an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength"; Britten was not, and learned little from him. He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for [...] "nurs <b>me</b> <b>very</b> gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence".|$|E
