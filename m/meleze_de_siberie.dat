50|$|It {{makes some}} wonder, {{that the story}} became {{well-known}} and popular in the West even faster than in Russia. It turned into series of music and literature works too. The first novel Élisabeth ou les Exilés <b>de</b> <b>Sibérie</b> (in the English variant - The Exiles of Siberia, 1806) about Praskovia’s fate was written by Sophie Ristaud Cottin. Later on, Xavier de Maistre creates his novel La Jeune Sibérienne, (in the English variant - The Young Siberian, 1815). Then, basing on the novel by Cottin, the Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti creates the lyrical drama Otto mesi in due ore o Gli esiliati in Siberia (in the English variant - Eight months in two hours, 1827).|$|R
5000|$|Born Marie Sophie Ristaud (sometimes spelt Risteau) in March 1770 at Tonneins, Lot-et-Garonne, {{she was not}} yet twenty {{when she}} married her first husband, Jean-Paul-Marie Cottin, a banker. She wrote several romantic and {{historical}} novels including Elizabeth; or, the Exiles of Siberia (Elisabeth ou les Exilés <b>de</b> <b>Sibérie</b> 1806), a [...] "wildly romantic but irreproachably moral tale", according to Nuttall's Encyclopaedia. She also published Claire d'Albe (1799), Malvina (1801), Amélie de Mansfield (1803), Mathilde (1805), set in the crusades, and a prose-poem, La Prise de Jéricho. Her writing became more important to her after her first husband {{died when she was}} in her early twenties. She went to live with a cousin and her three children at Champlan (Seine-et-Oise) but died in her thirties, in Paris on 25 August 1807.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the failure}} of a similar piece, Phédor et Waldamir, ou la famille <b>de</b> <b>Sibérie</b> (1801), Ducis ceased to write for the stage; {{and the rest of his}} life was spent in quiet {{retirement}} at Versailles.He had been named a member of the Council of the Ancients in 1798, but he never discharged the functions of the office; and when Napoleon offered him a post of honor under the empire, he refused.Amiable, religious and bucolic, he had little sympathy with the fierce, sceptical and tragic times in which his lot was cast. [...] "Alas!" [...] he said in the midst of the Revolution, [...] "tragedy is abroad in the streets; if I step outside of my door, I have blood to my very ankles. I have too often seen Atreus in clogs, to venture to bring an Atreus on the stage." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{longtime}} hip-hop fan, at age 21 Diarra {{began his}} {{collaboration with the}} fledgling rap collective Time Bomb, honing his craft alongside future superstars like Booba and Diam's. He quickly developed into a lyricist with a metaphorical ingenuity far more advanced than his contemporaries, crafting violent yet strangely poetic portraits of urban Paris life and drawing on the street-smart American hip-hop of the Notorious B.I.G. and other icons to document life in Paris' hardscrabble 19th district. In 1996 Oxmo Puccino made his recorded debut with Pucc. Fiction, {{a contribution to the}} compilation L432. A series of subsequent mixtape appearances solidified his growing reputation within the French rap underground, and in 1998 he issued his solo debut, Opéra Puccino. Its 2001 follow-up, L'Amour Est Mort, proved Puccino's creative and commercial breakthrough, while 2004's Le Cactus <b>de</b> <b>Sibérie</b> confirmed his star status. After signing to the venerable jazz label Blue Note, Puccino assembled a new backing group, the Jazzbastards, to record 2006's Lipopette Bar.|$|R

40|$|Summary &mdash; More than 100 clones {{of hybrid}} larch (Larix x eurolepis) have been vegetatively propa-gated by stem {{cuttings}} and their behaviour {{under field conditions}} been examined in 2 clonal tests up to age 8 and 10 yr. Rooting rate was high (87 %) but very variable from clone to clone. Transfer of rooted cuttings from greenhouse to the nursery remained a serious problem. No correlation between ortet vigour (total height at age 2 yr) and rooting ability could be found. Rooted cuttings behaved mostly like seedlings for both growth traits and stem form, at least when taken from young ortets (2 yr old). Age (2 compared to 16 yr) of donor plants seemed to have long-lasting effects (up to age 10 yr) on further growth of ramets. The genetic composition evolution of a fictive multiclonal variety was simulated up to age 8 yr. No major change in {{the representation of the}} component clones could be observed.

Among the manuscripts collected by Voltaire {{on the history}} of Russia, there is a copy of three hitherto unpublished letters from J. N. Delisle in St. Petersburg to Plélo, the ambassador in Denmark. They date from 1732 and 1733, and concern Delisle's work on a general map of the Russian Empire, whose Siberian possessions were little-known. Delisle informs Plélo of the discoveries made on Bering's first voyage and of the departure of his second expedition. As he was mainly invited to Russia in order to set up the study of astronomy in this country, he tries, via Plélo, to obtain the observations of the Danish astronomer Horrebow, who had succeeded Roemer at the Copenhagen Observatory.

40|$|Sentimental Manipulations: Duty and Desire in the Novels of Sophie Cottin" {{examines}} four novels by Sophie Cottin, from 1798 until 1806. A forgotten but once-popular novelist, Cottin {{used the}} theme of motherhood to develop the relationship between women and desire and duty. These novels use the sentimental novel in different ways that challenge the limits of genre and confront social perceptions of motherhood. The generic transitions reveal subversive representations of women's sexuality and choice. The author's rewriting of motherhood and genre thus {{plays a crucial role}} in understanding the complex and developing notion of the sentimental novel in a period of transition after the Revolution. The eighteenth century gave rise to more structured gender divisions in society that provided little space for women's freedom outside of the patriarchal dictates of the family and motherhood. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's 1761 publication of Julie; ou la Nouvelle Héloïse and his 1762 publication of Emile; ou de l'éducation are thought to have defined social roles for women in relation to their reproductive abilities. The novel, as a site of social production, was understood to have influential moral implications and was used to confront and maintain socially accepted behavior. Mother-child depictions in literature, therefore, reveal socially acceptable behavior for women. My first chapter examines the development of motherhood as a form of social duty imposed on women. I explore the Rousseauian themes in Cottin's first sentimental epistolary novel, Claire d'Albe, published in 1978. The representation of adultery reveals the complex relationship between women's duty, virtue, and sexuality. In my second chapter, I analyze how Cottin manipulates the epistolary sentimental genre in Amélie Mansfield, published in 1802. Cottin creates narrative spaces that privilege women's expression and redefine women's choice through a violent and controversial depiction of the protagonist's suicide. I explore the social implications of the removal of the suicide scene from all publications of the novel after 1805. My third chapter examines the incorporation of elements of the travel narrative into the sentimental genre in Malvina, published in 1800, and Elisabeth; ou les exilés <b>de</b> <b>Sibérie,</b> published in 1805. Through the description of travel, I explore Cottin's representations of duty and women's education at two distinct moments in her publishing career. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|The State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) {{contains}} a corpus of around one hundred letters sent by Élisée Reclus to Pëtr Kropotkin between 1882 and 1905. The correspondence is mainly concerned with their geographical works, notably the collaboration of Kropotkin with the Nouvelle Géographie Universelle (1876 e 1894) and the Brussels edition of Kropotkin’s Orographie <b>de</b> la <b>Sibérie</b> (1904), edited by Reclus. In this paper, we deal {{first with the}} importance of this source: it {{is an example of the}} material work of a network of geographers who were at the same time the founders of the international anarchist movement. We suggest the correspondence falls into two parts: the first period (1882 e 1886) when Reclus was in exile in Switzerland after the Paris Commune of 1871, and Kropotkin was in prison in France; and the second period (1888 e 1905) when the two anarchist geographers discuss the role of geographical education, historical geography in Europe and its part in the globalisation of their era. The archive also contains significant evidence of their relationships with British geography: Kropotkin lived in London and joined the Royal Geographical Society and was on familiar terms with leading Fellows, such as John Scott Keltie and Halford Mackinder. The paper addresses the significance of the correspondence for understanding the relationships between geography, politics and public education, and the role of these heterodox geographers in the construction of geographical knowledge.

40|$|Catherine Claudon-Adhémar and Francis Claudon : Chappe d'Auteroche's Voyage en Siberie. The astronomer, abbé Chappe d'Auteroche {{was almost}} the first Frenchman to {{describe}} Siberia, where he went in order to observe a comet in 1761. His work was published in 1768 and republished several times; the only contemporary work comparable to Chappe's is Biischung's Neue Erdbeschreibung (French translation 1768). Chappe's Voyage is interesting first of all for its choice of route (Paris-Tobolsk by road) and it provides information on the little-known geography of Siberia, including maps {{and all sorts of}} observations. Secondly, Chappe lists various geographical, climatic and above all sociological 'curiosities'. He is very impressed by the land of Russia, but he has less affection for its inhabitants, whom he finds wild with unexpected reactions — true barbarians in fact. He thus corrects Voltaire and Montesquieu, and his remarks on the relationship between nature and politics are still relevant today. Claudon Adhémar Catherine, Claudon Francis.

40|$|Abstract: Siberian {{boreal forest}} fires burn large areas annually, {{resulting}} in smoke that releases {{large amounts of}} par-ticulate emission into the atmosphere. We sampled aerosol emissions from experimental fires on three Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest sites of central Siberia. Emissions from ground-based aerosol samples were 0. 1 – 0. 7 t/ha. This value represented 1 %– 7 % of the total biomass (10 – 30 t/ha) consumed during the experimental fires. We were able to classify the chemical composition of 77 %– 90 % {{of the mass of}} particulate fire emissions. Chemical analysis indi-cated that an average of 8 %– 17 % of the particulate composition was of mineral origin. Carbonaceous aerosols created because of incomplete combustion ranged from 50 % to 70 % of the total aerosol mass. The fraction of aerosols contain-ing elemental carbon (EC) (i. e., graphite, soot, and charcoal) was 7 %– 15 %. As our samples were taken near the ground surface, these results represent freshly emitted fire aerosols that have not yet had time to react with atmospheric mois-ture or to undergo postfire chemical or physical–chemical changes. In a typical year, where 12 × 106 – 14 × 106 ha burn in Russia, we estimate that 3 × 106 – 10 × 106 t of particulate matter may be emitted into the atmosphere.
