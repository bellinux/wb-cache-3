5000|$|The arid {{climate of}} the town of Chimayo greatly {{influences}} the appearance of the Chimayo pepper, giving it a twisted, [...] "sun-dried" [...] shape. Its color can be compared to that of the Jalapeño, transitioning from green to red as the fruit matures. Chimayo peppers are of <b>medium</b> <b>pungency,</b> and have a heat level ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 on the Scoville scale. Chimayo pepper plants typically grow to a height of roughly 18 to 24 in, while the fruits reach 4 to 6 in in length.|$|E
5000|$|The jalapeño ( [...] , , , [...] ) is a {{medium-sized}} chili pepper pod type cultivar {{of the species}} Capsicum annuum. A mature jalapeño fruit is 5 - 10 cm long and hangs down with a round, firm, smooth flesh of 25 - 38 mm wide. It is of mild to <b>medium</b> <b>pungency,</b> having a range of 1,000 to 20,000 Scoville units, depending on cultivar. Commonly picked and consumed while still green, it is occasionally allowed to fully ripen and turn red, orange, or yellow. It is wider and milder than the similar Serrano pepper. The Chile Pepper Institute is known for developing colored variations.|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} canning sardine in two {{different}} curry media is presented. One curry medium yields a product with <b>medium</b> <b>pungency</b> while the second one has a low pungency. Sardine canned in curry medium having <b>medium</b> <b>pungency</b> developed signs of internal corrosion as well as slight bitter taste {{at the end of}} 15 months storage at ambient temperature. Similar phenomenon took place in the other product only at the end of 18 months storage. Being a ready to serve product it needs no further preparation for the table...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen onion landraces from North-West Spain were {{evaluated}} using microsatellites markers. Eleven polymorphic markers identified 32 alleles {{in the whole}} collection, {{with an average of}} 2. 9 alleles per locus. High values of observed (mean of 0. 45) and expected heterozigosity (mean of 0. 51) were detected for the majority of loci. Wright’s fixation index confirmed an excess of heterozygotes and a low level of inbreeding within the collection. Multivariate analyses revealed that Oimbra was the most distinctive genotype. The remaining 16 onion genotypes were in part assorted according to some morphological traits of bulbs. Pungency and solid soluble content highly varied among landraces and bulbs. Five landraces were classified as sweet, whereas 9 possessed <b>medium</b> <b>pungency</b> and 3 were recorded as pungent. This onion collection represents a useful source of genetic heterogeneity that might be exploited in breeding programs for the generation of new onion varieties that satisfy consumer demand...|$|E
