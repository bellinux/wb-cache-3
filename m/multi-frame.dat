40|$|This paper {{explores the}} merits and practicalities {{of using a}} <b>multi-framing</b> {{approach}} in problem solving and decision making, through applying it to a real situation. We provide a rationale for the <b>multi-framing</b> approach, which is founded on the notions {{that there is no}} one correct way to approach most real problems, and that single-frame approaches can induce frame blindness. The case analysis demonstrates benefits of <b>multi-framing</b> that include building frame awareness, overcoming frame blindness, and understanding the development of perspectives that contribute to more robust and acceptable ‘solutions’. We describe our experiences of using framing as a meta-framework for problem solving and illustrate how the approach may be used in the classroom. In doing so, we indicate how the nature and success of problem-solving interventions can be frame dependent. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{first part}} of this article {{identified}} a limitation in the range of options being considered by healthcare professionals when problem-solving or making decisions. Part two of the article builds upon this idea and describes a process where these limitations can be overcome through the use of multiple framing. Methodology/Approach Masters students, who are also healthcare managers, were asked to undertake <b>multi-framed</b> analyses of different decision-making scenarios. Practical Implications The exercise enabled the healthcare managers to recognise weaknesses of seeking solutions within a predominantly structural frame, to challenge this narrow application and to explore the benefits and utility of multiple framing. Originality/Value The development of a technique used to enable 'reframing' of problems, contexts and potential solutions is outlined. A strategy is proposed which firstly, enables the current management frames to be identified and secondly, adopts a <b>multi-framing</b> approach to problem-solving. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} robust system to {{recognize}} vehicle license plate by <b>multi-frames</b> learning. To fast locate {{the position of}} a license plate, we adopt a morphology-based method to extract important contrast features as filters to find all possible license plate candidates after calculating motion energy from video frames. The contrast feature is robust to lighting changes and invariant to different transformations like image scaling, translation, and skewing. Due to noise, many impossible license regions may be extracted. Hence, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is adopted for verifying license plate regions. After locating license plate, the scheme of shape contexts is used to recognize the characters in license plate. To improve the correct rate of recognition, the verifying technique of <b>multi-frames</b> is further involved in our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust for the recognition of license plate.

40|$|Malay speech {{recognition}} is becoming popular among Malaysian researchers. In Malaysia, more local researchers {{are focusing on}} noise robust and accurate independent speaker {{speech recognition}} systems that use Malay language. The performance of speech recognition application under adverse noisy condition often becomes the topic of interest among speech recognition researchers in any languages. This paper presents a study of noise robust capability of an improved vowel feature extraction method called Spectrum Delta (SpD). The features are extracted from both original data and noise-added data and classified using three classifiers; (i) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), (ii) K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and (iii) Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). Most of the dependent and independent speaker systems which use mostly <b>multi-framed</b> analysis, yielded accuracy between 89 % to 100 % for dependent speaker system and between 70 % to 94 % for an independent speaker. This study shows that SpD features obtained an accuracy of 92. 42 % to 95. 11 % using all the four classifiers on a single framed analysis which makes this result comparable to those analysed with <b>multi-framed</b> approach...|$|R
