5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E

40|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> was {{developed}} by ancient Greek geometers to identify and solve problems related to geometry. From that period, well known scientists such as Newton and Descartes have applied the method. More recently, Polya has presented the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> as a heuristic template to solve mathematical and other problems. Despite its continual epistemological dilution, the method has also been used to explain the cognitive process of designing. In this paper it is claimed that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> can also explain production management. It seems that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> has been used across different levels of management in production, i. e. from a holistic/strategic perspective through to detailed levels. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} paper is to discuss whether the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> provides a partial theoretical foundation for production planning. The research approach is literature review with an emphasis on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and synthesis. The conclusion is that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and synthesis adds to the theoretical explanation of both design and production...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides {{towards the}} {{reconciliation}} {{of faith and}} experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century StAnselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, Peter Abelard followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, Robert Grosseteste used Abelard's <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.|$|E

25|$|In modern academia, {{music theory}} is a {{subfield}} of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, music theory {{is an act}} of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle. As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, {{but there is also a}} body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production. A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the M.A. or Ph.D level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. <b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of musical acoustics, considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (Harmony and Counterpoint), among other topics.|$|E
50|$|In short, some {{philosophers}} {{feel strongly}} that the analytic method (especially conceptual analysis) is essential to and defines philosophy—e.g. Jackson (1998), Chalmers (1996), and Bealer (1998). Yet, some philosophers argue that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> is problematic—e.g. Stich (1998) and Ramsey (1998). Some, however, take the middle ground and argue that while analysis is largely a fruitful <b>method</b> <b>of</b> inquiry, philosophers should not limit themselves to only using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{internal}} {{investigation by the}} university released in 2011 and another investigation commissioned by former North Carolina governor Jim Martin in 2012 found numerous academic and ethical issues with the AFAM department, including unauthorized grade changes and faculty signatures, classes with very little teaching taking place, and a disproportionate proportion of the student-athletes enrolled in affected classes. Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes are not academically qualified for college. Additionally, former basketball player Rashad McCants, {{a member of the}} North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, said that he took substandard classes and had much of his classwork done by tutors. As a result of these revelations, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the university on probation for one year, which ended in June 2016. The NCAA completed its investigation in October of 2017, finding no violations of the NCAA's rules and imposing no athletic punishments. It affected a variety of different people in different ways, including coaches, players, judges, politicians, academics, rivals, whistleblowers, lawyers, alumni, mascots, college administrators, the NCAA, state governors, and journalists. The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university was educating some of its student-athletes properly and the role of NCAA Division I athletics in colleges.|$|E

500|$|Plateosaurus is {{a member}} of a group of early herbivores known as [...] "prosauropods". The group name is obsolete, as [...] "Prosauropoda" [...] is not a {{monophyletic}} group (thus given in quotation marks), and most researchers prefer the term basal sauropodomorph. Plateosaurus was the first [...] "prosauropod" [...] to be described, and gives its name to the family Plateosauridae Marsh, 1895 as the type genus. Initially, when the genus was poorly known, it was only included in Sauria, being some kind of reptile, but not in any more narrowly defined taxon. In 1845, von Meyer created the group Pachypodes (a defunct junior synonym of Dinosauria) to include Plateosaurus, Iguanodon, Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus. Plateosauridae was proposed by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1895 within Theropoda. Later it was moved to [...] "Prosauropoda" [...] by von Huene, a placement that was accepted by most authors. Before the advent of cladistics in paleontology during the 1980s, with its emphasis on monophyletic groups (clades), Plateosauridae was defined loosely, as large, broad-footed, broad-handed forms with relatively heavy skulls, unlike the smaller [...] "anchisaurids" [...] and sauropod-like [...] "melanorosaurids". Reevaluation of [...] "prosauropods" [...] in light of the new <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> led to the reduction of Plateosauridae. For many years the clade only included Plateosaurus and various junior synonyms, but later two more genera were considered to belong to it: Sellosaurus and possibly Unaysaurus.
