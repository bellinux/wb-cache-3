Methods: Participating COPD modeling groups simulated the outcomes for the placebo-treated groups of the TORCH and UPLIFT trials using baseline characteristics of the trial populations as input. Groups then simulated treatment effectiveness by using relative reductions in annual decline in lung function and exacerbation frequency observed in the most intensively treated group compared with placebo as input for the models. Main outcomes were (change in) total/severe exacerbations and mortality. Furthermore, the absolute differences in total exacerbations and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to approximate the cost per exacerbation avoided and the cost per QALY gained. Result: Of the six participating <b>models,</b> three <b>models</b> <b>reported</b> higher total exacerbation rates than observed in the TORCH trial (1. 13 /patient-year) (models: 1. 22 - 1. 48). Four <b>models</b> <b>reported</b> higher rates than observed in the UPLIFT trial (0. 85 /patient-year) (models: 1. 13 - 1. 52).

This <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> has been developed in accordance with the ''Technical Work Plan for: Performance Assessment Unsaturated Zone'' (Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) 2002 [160819]). The technical work plan (TWP) describes planning information pertaining to the technical scope, content, and management of this <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> in Section 1. 12, Work Package AUZM 08, ''Coupled Effects on Flow and Seepage''. The plan for validation of the models documented in this <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> is given in Attachment I, Model Validation Plans, Section I- 3 - 4, of the TWP. Except for variations in acceptance criteria (Section 4. 2), there were no deviations from this TWP. This report was developed in accordance with AP-SIII. 10 Q, ''Models''. This <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> documents the THC Seepage Model and the Drift Scale Test (DST) THC Model. The THC Seepage Model is a drift-scale process model for predicting the composition of gas and water that could enter waste emplacement drifts and the effects of mineral alteration on flow in rocks surrounding drifts. The DST THC model is a drift-scale process model relying on the same conceptual model and much of the same input data (i. e., physical, hydrological, thermodynamic, and kinetic) as the THC Seepage Model. The DST THC Model is the primary method for validating the THC Seepage Model. The DST THC Model compares predicted water and gas compositions, as well as mineral alteration patterns, with observed data from the DST. These models provide the framework to evaluate THC coupled processes at the drift scale, predict flow and transport behavior for specified thermal-loading conditions, and predict the evolution of mineral alteration and fluid chemistry around potential waste emplacement drifts. The DST THC Model is used solely for the validation of the THC Seepage Model and is not used for calibration to measured data...|$|E

This <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> was planned in ''Technical Work Plan (TWP) for: Performance Assessment Unsaturated Zone'' (BSC 2002 [160819], Section 1. 12. 7), and was developed in accordance with AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models. In this <b>Model</b> <b>Report,</b> any reference to ''repository'' means the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, and any reference to ''drifts'' means the emplacement drifts at the repository horizon. This <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> provides the necessary framework to test conceptual hypotheses for analyzing mountain-scale hydrological/chemical/mechanical changes and predict flow behavior in response to heat release by radioactive decay from the nuclear waste repository at the Yucca Mountain site. The mountain-scale coupled TH/THC/THM processes models numerically simulate the impact of nuclear waste heat release on the natural hydrogeological system, including a representation of heat-driven processes occurring in the far field. The TH simulations provide predictions for thermally affected liquid saturation, gas- and liquid-phase fluxes, and water and rock temperature (together called the flow fields). The main focus of the TH Model is to predict the changes in water flux driven by evaporation/condensation processes, and drainage between drifts. The TH Model captures mountain-scale three dimensional (3 -D) flow effects, including lateral diversion at the PTn/TSw interface and mountain-scale flow patterns. The Mountain-Scale THC Model evaluates TH effects on water and gas chemistry, mineral dissolution/precipitation, and the resulting impact to UZ hydrological properties, flow and transport. The THM Model addresses changes in permeability due to mechanical and thermal disturbances in stratigraphic units above and below the repository host rock. The Mountain-Scale THM Model focuses on evaluating the changes in 3 -D UZ flow fields arising out of thermal stress and rock deformation during and after the thermal periods...|$|E

The initial documentation of this <b>model</b> <b>report</b> was conducted under the ''Technical Work Plan For: Saturated Zone Flow and Transport Modeling and Testing'' (BSC 2003 [DIRS 163965]). The <b>model</b> <b>report</b> has been revised in accordance with the ''Technical Work Plan For: Natural System [...] Saturated Zone Analysis and <b>Model</b> <b>Report</b> Integration'', Section 2. 1. 1. 4 (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171421]) to incorporate Regulatory Integration Team comments. All activities listed in the technical work plan that are appropriate to the transport model are documented in this report and are described in Section 2. 1. 1. 4 (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171421]). This report documents: (1) the advection-dispersion transport model including matrix diffusion (Sections 6. 3 and 6. 4); (2) a description and validation of the transport model (Sections 6. 3 and 7); (3) the numerical methods for simulating radionuclide transport (Section 6. 4); (4) the parameters (sorption coefficient, Kd) and their uncertainty distributions used for modeling radionuclide sorption (Appendices A and C); (5) the parameters used for modeling colloid-facilitated radionuclide transport (Table 4 - 1, Section 6. 4. 2. 6, and Appendix B); and (6) alternative conceptual models and their dispositions (Section 6. 6). The intended use of this model is to simulate transport in saturated fractured porous rock (double porosity) and alluvium. The particle-tracking method of simulating radionuclide transport is incorporated in the finite-volume heat and mass transfer numerical analysis (FEHM) computer code, (FEHM V 2. 20, STN: 10086 - 2. 20 - 00) (LANL 2003 [DIRS 161725]) and is described in Section 6. 4 of this report. FEHM is a three-dimensional (3 -D), finite-volume, finite-element, heat and mass flow-and-transport code. This report documents the features and capabilities of the site-scale transport model for calculating radionuclide transport in the SZ at Yucca Mountain in support of the TSPA-LA.
