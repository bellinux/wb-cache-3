25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by <b>me</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

500|$|Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone {{asserted}} that [...] "This is 100 percent {{having to do}} with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E

Instead, try redefining a super couple by the intensity of their love, their loss and their ability to move on without their other half. It leaves us frustrated, heartbroken and yearning for more.

2500|$|After his wife's death, {{he began}} to {{disagree}} with the church's methods, writing in his journal in June 1832, [...] "I have sometimes thought that, {{in order to be}} a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry. The profession is antiquated. In an altered age, we worship in the dead forms of our forefathers". His disagreements with church officials over the administration of the Communion service and misgivings about public prayer eventually led to his resignation in 1832. As he wrote, [...] "This mode of commemorating Christ is not suitable to <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> reason enough why I should abandon it". As one Emerson scholar has pointed out, [...] "Doffing the decent black of the pastor, he was free to choose the gown of the lecturer and teacher, of the thinker not confined within the limits of an institution or a tradition".|$|E

Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.'

At first, Klee was {{somewhat}} detached from it, {{as he wrote}} ironically, [...] "I have long had this war in <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> why, inwardly, it is none of my concern." [...] Klee was conscripted as a Landsturmsoldat (soldier of the reserve forces in Prussia or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends August Macke and Franz Marc in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink lithographs on war themes including Death for the Idea (1915). After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company in Oberschleissheim, executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft camouflage, and [...] accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he {{was transferred to the}} Royal Bavarian flying school in Gersthofen (which 54 years later became the USASA Field Station Augsburg) to work as a clerk for the treasurer {{until the end of the}} war.

2500|$|There {{are several}} eucharistic rituals within the magical canon. Two {{of the most}} well known are The Mass of the Phoenix and The Gnostic Mass. The first is a ritual {{designed}} for the individual, which involves sacrificing a [...] "Cake of Light" [...] (a type of bread {{that serves as the}} host) to Ra (i.e. the Sun) and infusing a second Cake with the adept's own blood (either real or symbolic, in a gesture reflecting the myth of the Pelican cutting its own breast to feed its young) and then consuming it with the words, [...] "There is no grace: there is no guilt: This is the Law: Do what thou wilt!" [...] The other ritual, The Gnostic Mass, is a very popular public ritual (although it can be practiced privately) that involves a team of participants, including a Priest and Priestess. This ritual is an enactment of the mystical journey that culminates with the Mystic Marriage and the consumption of a Cake of Light and a goblet of wine (a process termed [...] "communication"). Afterwards, each Communicant declares, [...] "There is no part of <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not of the gods!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 13, 2006, a {{statement}} was issued in Hayes's name, indicating {{that he was}} asking {{to be released from}} his contract with Comedy Central, citing recent episodes which satirized religious beliefs as being intolerant. [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins," [...] he was quoted in the press statement. However, the statement did not directly mention Scientology. A response from Matt Stone said that Hayes' complaints stemmed from the show's criticism of Scientology and that he [...] "has no problem – and he's cashed plenty of checks – with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons or Jews." [...] Stone adds, [...] " [...] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone and Parker agreed to release Hayes from his contract by his request. In 2007, Hayes said he had quit because [...] "they [...] didn't pay me enough... They weren't that nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the content}} of the {{official}} press release, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode [...] "Trapped in the Closet", and its treatment of Scientology. Stone commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on South Park: [...] " [...] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [...] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Fox News reporter Roger Friedman suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and {{not in a position to}} make a rational decision to leave the show. Friedman also reported that Hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow Scientologists, the decision was not voluntary, and the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him. In a 2016 oral history of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Isaac Hayes III confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own.|$|E
