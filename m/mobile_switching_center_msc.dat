40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in wireless communications and mobile networking have dramatically increased {{the popularity of}} multimedia services for mobile users, with wireless video streaming at their fingertips. To facilitate efficient acquisition of video content, proxy caching has been widely used by wireless service providers (WSPs), which typically deploy cache servers at <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centers</b> (<b>MSCs).</b> However, capacity provisioning of cache servers is challenging, given the dynamic user demands and the limited cache server resources. With increased densities of wireless service deployment, it is increasingly common that mobile users are covered {{by more than one}} WSP within an area. This brings opportunities of a collaborative caching paradigm among the cache servers deployed at different MSCs. In this paper, we explore the benefits of collaborative caching in wireless streaming services, addressing both challenges of incentives and truthfulness of selfish WSPs. We propose a collaborative mecha-nism that maximizes the social welfare in the context of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, in which cache servers cooperate in the trading of their resources in a self-enforcing manner. Experimental results demonstrate that superior performance can be achieved with respect to the quality of video streaming...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new scheme (or algorithm) {{in order to}} {{optimize}} the frequency assignment and to enable the reuse of same frequency by sufficiently distant cell. This is to maximize the number of communication (calls) but with {{a limited number of}} frequencies. The proposed scheme is called dual band frequency channel borrowing (DBFCB). In Simple Borrowing, channel assignments are borrowed from the adjacent cells and are returned to that cell after it has become free. When a new call initiates and reaches to a cell, and if currently, all the permanent channels allocated to the cell are busy, then channels are borrowed from adjacent cell provided the channels are available (in adjacent cell) and minimum reusable distance constraint is met. In Channel Borrowing algorithms, a database is maintained for the record of channels as per their status either currently in use, borrowed or free. <b>Mobile</b> <b>switch</b> <b>center</b> (<b>MSC),</b> taking care of the channel borrowing activities, runs the channel borrowing procedure, so that channels available are borrowed from the cell having relatively more free channels. Channel borrowing is done under minimum reusable distance constraint. The performance may be reduced for ongoing connections, due to increase of overheads in the base stations of the cellular Mobile system [15].|$|R
50|$|The {{base station}} {{controller}} (BSC) provides, classically, the intelligence behind the BTSs. Typically a BSC has tens or even hundreds of BTSs under its control. The BSC handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers from BTS to BTS (except {{in the case of}} an inter-BSC handover in which case control is in part the responsibility of the anchor MSC). A key function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low capacity connections to BTSs (with relatively low utilisation) become reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> (<b>MSC)</b> (with a high level of utilisation). Overall, this means that networks are often structured to have many BSCs distributed into regions near their BTSs which are then connected to large centralised MSC sites.|$|E

40|$|TCP is a {{reliable}} transport protocol tuned {{to perform well}} in traditional networks made up of links with low bit-error rates. Networks with higher bit-error rates, such as those with wireless links and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made by transmission control protocol (TCP), causing degraded end-to-end performance. In this paper, we propose a two-layer hierarchical cache architecture for enhancing TCP performance over heterogeneous networks with both wired and wireless links. A new network-layer protocol, called new snoop (NS), is designed. The main idea is to cache the unacknowledged packets at both <b>mobile</b> <b>switch</b> <b>center</b> (<b>MSC)</b> and base station (BS), to form a two-layer cache hierarchy. If a packet is lost due to transmission errors in wireless link, the BS takes the responsibility to recover the loss. When a handoff occurs, the packets cached at MSC can help to minimize the latency of retransmissions due to temporal disconnection. NS can preserve the end-to-end TCP semantics and is compatible with existing TCP applications. Its implementation only requires code modification at the BS and MSC. Simulation results show that NS is significantly more robust in dealing with unreliable wireless links and handoffs {{as compared with the}} original Snoop scheme, as well as some other existing TCP enhancements. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Centers</b> (<b>MSCs)</b> in {{wireless}} {{telecommunication networks}} must implement signaling overload controls to maintain acceptable performance {{during periods of}} high load especially due to fast changing hot spots resulting from user mobility. An MSC’s signaling load comprises a variety of service requests, some {{more important than the}} others, and it must treat them differentially under overload conditions. We propose multi-class overload control algorithms that are highly reactive to sudden bursts of signaling load and maintain high performance under a wide range of overload conditions as well. First, we introduce the concept of equivalent system load measures to convert the system load measures associated with different classes of traffic into a single measure with respect to a pre-defined base class. We use this concept to develop three multi-class overload detection and measurement algorithms. Next, we develop a new algorithm for partitioning the allowable equivalent system load across multiple traffic classes, using a strict priority scheme. Using simulations of call flows from mobile telecommunications standards, we compare different multi-class overload algorithms under a variety of overload conditions. Our simulation results indicate that our algorithm that measures system load using a combination of request acceptance rate and processor occupancy, provides highly reactive and robust overload control. Last, for the purpose of making the overload control algorithms more robust, we propose a measurement-based simple regression technique to dynamically estimate key system parameters. We find that estimates derived in this manner converge rapidly to their true values. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{approach}} for planning location areas (LAs) {{in a personal}} communication services network (PCSN) to be overlaid on an existing wired network. Given the average speed of mobile terminals, the number of <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centers</b> (<b>MSCs),</b> their locations, call handling capacity of each MSC, handoff cost between adjacent cells and call arrival rate, an important consideration in a PCSN is to identify the cells in every LA {{to be connected to}} the corresponding MSC in a cost effective manner. In this work, while planning a location area, we present a two-step approach, namely optimization of total system recurring cost (subproblem I), and optimization of hybrid cost (subproblem II). The planning first determines the optimum number of cells in an LA from subproblem I. Then it finds out the exact LAs by assigning cells to the switches, while optimizing the hybrid cost which comprises the handoff cost and the cable cost, in subproblem II. This divide-and-conquer strategy provides a practical way for designing LAs. As our approach toward LA planning takes into accounts both cost and network planning factors, this unique combination will be of great interest to PCSN designers. It develops an optimum network planning method {{for a wide range of}} call-to-mobility ratios (CMRs) that minimizes the total system recurring cost while still ensuring a good system performance. Our study shows that acceptable results are achievable with a reasonable computational effort, which supports the engineered planning of a PCSN...|$|R

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{community is}} migrating {{toward a new}} network architecture based on horizontal layers. Call control and connectivity, which have traditionally been bundled in telecommunication networks, are being separated into different layers. The connectivity layer is based primarily on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and Internet protocol (IP) transmission. Access networks and the core network are parts of the connectivity layer. The connectivity layer provides interfaces to legacy networks, such as the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The layered architecture is being deployed in third-generation mobile networks—that is, the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS).
