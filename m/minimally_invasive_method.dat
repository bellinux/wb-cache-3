This is known as the Hall Technique and works by depriving the bacteria in the decay of nutrients and making their environment less favorable for them.

50|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery should have less operative trauma, other complications and adverse effects than an equivalent open surgery. It {{may be more}} or less expensive (for dental implants, a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method</b> reduces the cost of installed implants and shortens the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation time with 4-6 months). Operative time is longer, but hospitalization time is shorter. It causes less pain and scarring, speeds recovery, and reduces the incidence of post-surgical complications, such as adhesions and wound rupture. Some studies have compared heart surgery.|$|E

Kaye, Mouly, Peled and Tramier also scored the cartilage on the anterior side of the antihelix. Fritsch sometimes removed soft-tissue or bone between the conchal bowl and the mastoid. Narrow tunnels on the post auricular cartilage created a scar band to augment the retention sutures and attach to the conchal bowl correction.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results show}} that both the {{absolute}} and relative number of publications related to endometrial polyps have increased steadily during the last 30  years, testifying growing interest in the subject. During the same period great progress has occurred concerning the development of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} intrauterine pathology [8, 9]. We are now simply better than 30  years ago at looking inside the uterus and operating effectively, and with minimal invasiveness, conditions which in the past required a hysterectomy [10 – 12]. Endometrial polyps represent just one example of the different abnormalities of the uterine cavity frequently related to abnormal bleeding, infertility, or cancer risk [13]. We might speculate that the increase in the clinical use of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> for diagnosis and treatment [14] might {{have played a role in}} the increase of scientific interest on endometrial polyps, but this should be confirmed by other studies.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Dr. Dickman became heavily {{involved}} in both the development and popularization of endoscopic assisted spine procedures within neurosurgery. He pioneered the field of thoracoscopic neurosurgery, {{becoming one of the}} first neurosurgeons to use endoscopes to treat diseases of the thoracic spine via a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method.</b> He translated a relatively new technology utilized in the cardiothoracic surgical sub-specialty for neurosurgical purposes, and developed some of the basic instruments commonly used today by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons alike for minimally invasive thoracic spinal procedures. Thoracoscopic spine surgery has since become a common treatment modality for a multitude of neurosurgical pathologies, including Herniated Thoracic Discs and Hyperhidrosis. Dr. Dickman currently {{remains one of the most}} prolific thoracoscopic spine surgeons in the world, and has written the only textbook on the subject. His recently published series on the subject has become a standard by which other neurosurgeons are measured against.|$|E
50|$|FASTKD1 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential molecular biomarker for endometrial cancer, a cancer of the female genital tract, most notably using uterine aspirates This finding represent the basis {{for the development of a}} highly sensitive and specific <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method</b> for the screenings of endometrial cancer. Accordingly, gene expression screening on 52 carcinoma samples and series of real-time quantitative PCR validation on 19 paired carcinomas and normal tissue samples and on 50 carcinoma and non carcinoma uterine aspirates were performed to identify and validate potential biomarkers of endometrial cancer. Furthermore, another study designed a strategy to explore gene expression signatures associated with the survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), to search for aberrant gene activity, which consists of applying several filters to transcriptomic datasets from two pediatric ALL studies. Six genes whose expression in leukemic blasts was associated with prognosis were identified:three genes predicting poor prognosis (AK022211, FASTKD1 and STARD4) and three genes associated with a favorable outcome (CAMSAP1, PCGF6 and SH3RF3). Thus it appears that FASTKD1 may also play a role in ALL.|$|E

50|$|The Merck stitch <b>method</b> is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{procedure}} for pinning protruding ears, developed by Merck. The method {{belongs to the}} special types of ear pinning surgeries. In contrast to other variations of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedures the stitch method does not use additional techniques from the traditional ear pinning surgeries (otoplasty). It belongs to the closed ear pinning surgeries because the ear is not cut open for {{the placement of the}} sutures. According to the experience of the author the Stitch Method is suitable for all protruding ears. The stitch method is the most frequently performed otoplasty among the <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
30|$|Introduction: <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> of endometrial {{destruction}} {{have been}} evaluated as alternatives to hysterectomy in women with menorrhagia. Currently, second-generation methods of endometrial ablation are performed “blind” (without a hysteroscope), usually in the outpatient setting under local anesthesia, and require minimal cervical dilation. These methods include cryoablation, thermal balloon ablation, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and diode laser thermotherapy. This methods offers great satisfaction and safety to the patients.|$|R
