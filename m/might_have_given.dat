5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
25|$|Created as {{a result}} of the Cleveland Browns {{relocation}} controversy, the rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. Unlike the other two rivalries, this one is more lopsided: the Ravens lead 25-9. Additionally, this matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft picks for 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won Super Bowl for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by GM Ozzie Newsome) <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Browns the title after a 35-year drought. This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second world title in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{struggle}} between Maronites and Jacobites {{in the region}} started {{at the beginning of}} the 15th century and lasted till around the mid-16th century. It ended with the advantage going to the Maronites. This might have economically and demographically weakened the Jacobite population of Qaryat Moussa. Moreover, the heavy snows which are advanced as the cause behind the disappearance of the neighboring Jacobite village of Bqoufa around 1600 <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the last stroke to the existence of Qaryat Moussa as an independent agglomeration, obliging its surviving population to take refuge in Kfarsghab. The popular tradition in Kfarsghab attributes the disappearance of Qaryat Moussa to the displacement of the village water source to a lower location. This displacement could have been caused by the important seismic activity that the Levant region witnessed from the middle of the sixteenth century till the middle of the eighteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The Senate {{confirmed}} Richardson to be Clinton's Secretary of Energy on July 31, 1998. His {{tenure at}} the Department of Energy was marred by the Wen Ho Lee nuclear controversy. Richardson named Lee, an employee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, as a suspect who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> nuclear secrets to the Chinese government. Lee was later cleared of espionage charges and won a settlement against {{the federal government for}} the accusation. Richardson was also criticized by the Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry, which involved missing computer hard drives with sensitive data, by not testifying in front of Congress sooner. Richardson justified his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress. Republican Senators called for Richardson's resignation while both parties criticized his role in the incident, and the scandal ended Richardson's hope of being named as Al Gore's running mate for the 2000 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|Decker {{was five}} months {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of her disappearance. Extensive searches have found no trace of her or the child she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> birth to. Roldan, who had a criminal record prior to the disappearance, is considered a person of interest in the case. In 2015, he was arrested in North Carolina and charged with the attempted murder of another girlfriend after she survived several gunshot wounds he allegedly inflicted on her during an incident in 2014; he has not said anything about the Decker case. After she recovered, the victim claimed on the Dr. Phil show that he had made statements to her that might implicate him in Decker's disappearance. The incident has also been the subject of a segment of the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared. Roldan pled guilty to two lesser charges in 2016; after he serves his sentence he will deported to his native Bolivia.|$|E
25|$|At Maltby Secondary School, Trueman had two {{teachers}} called Dickie Harrison and Tommy Stubbs who recognised his talent as a bowler and picked {{him for the}} school team, {{even though he was}} much younger than the other players. His school playing career was interrupted for two years after he was seriously injured by a ball that hit him in the groin. He started playing again in 1945 when he was fourteen but left school that summer to start work, initially in a newsagent's shop. He had several jobs before becoming a professional cricketer. Inhibited by his injury, Trueman <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up on cricket at this time but instead, motivated by his family, he joined a nearby village club called Roche Abbey, playing regularly for them in 1946. He was successful at Roche Abbey and, before the 1947 season when he was sixteen, came to the notice of former Yorkshire player Cyril Turner who was coaching the Sheffield United Cricket Club which played at Bramall Lane, a ground then in regular use by Yorkshire for first-class cricket.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the policemen}} {{were not able}} to {{recognize}} where the shots were coming from. After roughly 30 minutes of gunfire, the CJNG gunmen left through the mountains' forest. Investigators {{were not able to}} confirm any casualties from the CJNG's side, but Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco stated that it was not uncommon for organized crime members to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the battlefield to prevent authorities from investigating and identifying the corpses. He said that the suspects were probably hiding in the nearby mountains, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to conduct a thorough search of the area. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco admitted that one of the biggest obstacles of the investigation was understanding how the CJNG found out the exact day, time, and place the police convoy was going to pass through the area where they were ambushed. He believes that the CJNG had precise information on the police's journey, and does not discard the possibility that an outsider <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the CJNG information on the police's arrangements, or that someone inside the police ranks was passing along information to them.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson {{came down}} from the {{pavilion}} end like a man possessed and bowled with great pace, far more than his controlled fast-medium. David Sheppard was caught in front of the wicket lbw for 0, Ted Dexter's off-stump was missed by a coat of varnish and Geoff Pullar was bowled through the gate. Colin Cowdrey came in at 19/2, but with bags of confidence after hitting 307 (with 4 sixes and 29 fours) against South Australia, his highest first-class score and the best by a tourist in Australia. Together Dexter and Cowdrey withstood Davidson's burst of speed, the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Occasionally Dexter would strike out {{and at the end of}} a long, hot day he gave Bobby Simpson a catch of Benaud (1/82) and was out for 93, his third missed century in three innings. The stand had made 175 runs and the unluckiest bowler was Norm O'Neill (0/19) who had Cowdrey dropped on 56 and dropped a hard-hit return from Dexter on 89. Cowdrey ended the day on 94 not out with Ken Barrington on 11, England 210/3 - still 106 runs behind - and the game very much in the balance. They returned the next day and Cowdrey made his third and highest century in Australia, having made 102 in Melbourne in 1954-55 and 100 not out in Sydney in 1958-59. The celebrations were short lived when Cowdrey (113) hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie, who then had Barrington (35) was lbw to a ball that cut back. Tom Graveney <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> England a real lead, but his was run out by a cracking throw from Neil Harvey for 41 and the last 4 wickets fell for 16 runs as Davidson (6/75) returned the clean up the tail; Fred Titmus caught behind, Fred Trueman skying the ball to O'Neill, Brian Statham having his stumps turned over and Len Coldwell edging to Benaud in the gully. Alan Smith was left 6 not out and England were out for 331, a lead of 15 runs when they had looked set for far more, or far worse.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{describing}} Stegosaurus, Marsh noted a large canal in the hip {{region of}} the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 {{times larger than the}} famously small brain. This has led to the influential idea that dinosaurs like Stegosaurus had a [...] "second brain" [...] in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. This [...] "brain" [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a Stegosaurus a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators.

At the time of the bombing, there were 100day-care centers in the United States in 7,900federal buildings.

He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up too quickly on writing.

500|$|In July, Maj. Gen John Pope {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} newly-formed Army of Virginia, which {{consisted}} of the commands of Banks, Irvin McDowell, and Franz Sigel.

500|$|Manning's first {{published}} works were three serialised detective novels, Rose of Rubies, Here is Murder and The Black Scarab {{which appeared in}} the Portsmouth News beginning in 1929 under the pseudonym Jacob Morrow. Manning did not acknowledge these books until the 1960s; their publication dates <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> away her age, a secret she kept even from her husband. Between 1929 and 1935 she wrote about 20 short stories, including a ghost story that was the first work to be published under her own name, though using initials to obscure her gender. Manning also wrote two literary novels, neither of which was accepted for publication. However, her second manuscript sufficiently impressed Edward Garnett, a literary editor at Jonathan Cape, that he asked his assistant Hamish Miles to write her a note of encouragement. Miles, a respected and well-connected literary adviser and translator in his late thirties, invited Manning to visit if she were ever in London. Manning, feeling stifled in Portsmouth, had already made efforts to move to the capital, but her meeting with Miles made her more determined. She succeeded in obtaining a typing job at Peter Jones, the department store, and, despite opposition from her mother, moved into a run-down [...] bed-sitting room in Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|On February 23, 303, Diocletian {{ordered that}} the newly built Christian church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized. February 23 was {{the feast of}} the Terminalia, for Terminus, the god of boundaries. It was the day they would {{terminate}} Christianity. The next day, Diocletian's first [...] "Edict against the Christians" [...] was published. The key targets of this piece of legislation were, as they had been during Valerian's persecution, Christian property and senior clerics. The edict prohibited Christians from assembling for worship, and ordered the destruction of their scriptures, liturgical books, and places of worship across the empire. But Christians tried to retain the scriptures as far as possible, though, according to de Ste Croix, [...] "it appears that giving them up...was not regarded as a sin" [...] in the East; sufficient numbers of them must have been successfully saved, as is evident from the representative findings of [...] "early biblical papyri" [...] in the stream of the transmission of the text during this period. Christians <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up apocryphal or pseudepigraphal works, or even refused to surrender their scriptures at the cost of their own lives, and there were some cases where the scriptures were not in the end destroyed. Christians were also deprived of the right to petition the courts, making them potential subjects for judicial torture; Christians could not respond to actions brought against them in court; Christian senators, equestrians, decurions, veterans, and soldiers were deprived of their ranks; and Christian imperial freedmen were re-enslaved.|$|E
500|$|The {{localization}} {{itself was}} handled by Bill Black {{and his company}} Binari Sonori, whose previous work included Demons' Score for Square Enix and [...] for Blizzard Entertainment. Another key staff member was Timothy Law, a localization editor from Square Enix who supervised the translation and voice recording for the title. An element of the localization that provided a challenge was creating a sense of wordplay equivalent with that used in the original Japanese. An example of this was the Performer job and its owner, the latter of which needed to have her first name adjusted while taking into consideration European gender perceptions. Another example from the dialogue was the need to create jokes that would not work in Japanese, such as Agnès commenting on finding a [...] "lucky charm". The subtitle [...] "Flying Fairy" [...] was removed for the western release as it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a false impression of family-friendly content due to different cultural perceptions to Japan. The English voice actors were chosen to sound as similar as possible to their Japanese counterparts, and adjustments were made to characters through the actors' performances: these included making Ringabel more flirtatious, and adjusting Edea's growl of rage between language versions. The game uses both the English and Japanese dubs, along with subtitles in multiple languages. The Western localization of the game contains censorship related to some sexual material in the original game: {{the ages of the}} main characters were increased to no longer be underage by Western standards, with 15-year-olds being changed to be 18-year-olds, and two of the female playable characters' costumes were altered to make them less revealing.|$|E
