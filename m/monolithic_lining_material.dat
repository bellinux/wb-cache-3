40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possible}} {{heat release}} rates of fires resulting from burning combustibles in 900 karaoke music compartments of 19 local karaokes were studied. Combustibles of concern are furniture foam, partitions and surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Equations {{appearing in the}} literature for calculating the heat release rates of these combustibles are used. Heat release rates of furniture foams were studied first, followed by igniting surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> classified under the Swedish system. The likelihood of flashover in those 900 karaoke music compartments was then investigated. Further, the total heat release rate curves for burning foam, surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> and carpets are studied using the results reported in the literature. Based on this study, it is recommended to select furniture foam with less heat release rates upon burning, and replace timber surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> as soon as possible. As an urgent action, a good fire safety management scheme “tailor-made ” for individual karaokes is to be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water temperature, in association with four denture cleansers, on the colour and surface roughness of five soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Method: Two silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> (Molloplast B and Sofreliner) represented the heat-cured, laboratory-based and chairside materials that are available. The wide range of chairside, acrylic resin-based, temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> was represented by Coe-Soft, Viscogel and Eversoft. An alkaline hypochlorite (Dentural) and three effervescent peroxide solutions {{with a range of}} active pH values (Steradent Active Plus, pH 6; Steradent Extra Strength, pH 3; Superdrug Fresh, pH 11) were selected as the cleansers. The denture cleansers were used at two temperatures: 55 °C (manufacturers' recommended temperature) and 80 °C. The colour of the specimens was evaluated using a colorimeter and the surface roughness was assessed using a three-dimensional, non-contact surface profilometer. This study reported on the effect of using both the higher temperatures and the recommended temperature on the colour and roughness of permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Results and Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the temperature of the water used with denture cleansers might have a detrimental effect on the colour and surface roughness of some permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

Two experimental silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> have been developed and demonstrate good physical properties. Purpose of study. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the extent of candidal adherence to these materials compared with a commercially available soft <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> and an acrylic resin denture base. Material and methods. The experimental materials were constructed in a stainless-steel mold, and their surface energies were determined with a dynamic contact angle analyzer. The adherence of three strains of C. albicans was determined with an in vitro assay. In addition, one test strain was used to determine the effect on adherence of precoating the materials with whole saliva. Results. Adhesion to all materials was strain variable, with the lowest adherence recorded for the two experimental materials. Decreased adherence was also apparent after precoating the materials with saliva. Correlation between surface energy of the material and the degree of candidal adhesion was seen for one strain, but no correlation was seen for the other two strains. Conclusion. Adherence of C. albicans to the two experimental silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> was significantly less than that for an acrylic resin denture base and a commercially available soft <b>lining</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} made that describes the basic stress-strain state of the <b>monolithic</b> <b>lining</b> vertical excavation for materials with a porous structure, the skeleton of which has compressed the hardening elastoplastic properties. The deformation of the porous medium under the action of given radial compressive loads {{is divided into two}} interconnected parts: the elastic deformation of the porous medium and the inelastic deformation of the compressed matrix. The problem of determining the fields of stresses and displacements lining vertical production at each stage of deformation is solved {{within the framework of the}} plane strain. It does not take into account the effects due to the fact that the excavation has a finite depth. The equations define the field of stresses and displacements in the first and second stages of the deformation. The conditions of compatibility are the continuity conditions of the selected components of stresses and displacements in the elastic-plastic boundary and plastic strains are equal to zero on it. Within the framework of the exact three-dimensional equations of stability, the stability of the ground state of the <b>monolithic</b> <b>lining</b> vertical excavation in rock mass with tight pores has been studied. The estimation of influence on the value of the boundary between the elastic and plastic deformation of the initial porosity of the media and the yield strength of the material has been explained.

40|$|Fatigue {{initiation}} {{and subsequent}} {{short and long}} crack growth has been investigated in an typical automotive bearing system, focussing on the behaviour of the aluminium-tin-silicon <b>lining</b> <b>material.</b> Crack initiation appears {{to be associated with}} decohesion of the interface between the primary, globular silicon and the aluminium matrix. Short crack growth, and crack growth at low Delta K levels in the long crack case, appears to be tortuous and highly microstructurally dependent, deviating towards secondary phase/matrix interfaces. At higher Delta K levels crack growth occurs principally through the aluminium matrix, and classical striations are seen. Multiple crack initiation is seen in the multiphase bearing <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> and crack coalescence gives rise to the dominant crack. Uncoalesced cracks appear to arrest at a "critical" surface crack length, whose dimension has been linked to sub-surface crack deflection within the <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> once the crack reaches the steel backing...|$|R
