We had indications in the week prior that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Novak</b> knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Novak</b> and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Novak</b> should not publish my name." ...|$|E

2500|$|ARMITAGE: Well, even <b>Mr.</b> <b>Novak</b> {{has said}} that he used the word [...] "operative" [...] and misused it. No one ever said [...] "operative."

[...] Indeed, it was already widely known (even by prosecutor Fitzgerald) that the actual [...] "leaker" [...] was Richard Armitage, via columnist Robert Novak.

2500|$|As a {{television}} actor, Scourby had roles on Playhouse 90, Circle Theatre, and Studio One.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} {{has been to}} attempt to illustrate, {{with the help of}} the novel, certain fundamental concepts in political studies, and to link these concepts coherently. The link that is established is not proposed as final. It is more a way in which ~ seeming coherence can be established. It is part of this dissertation to assert that the very nature of politics is such that any final linking of concepts is impossible for the single reason that politics, being normative essentially, cannot be static. The author would like to thank the staffs of the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus, and of McMaster University for help during the preparation of this work, and, in particular, his Supervisor, <b>Mr.</b> Derry <b>Novak,</b> who was, among all other things, consistently courteous. He would also like to thank Dean Melling for what he has found to be most searching and pregnant suggestions, comments, and understanding. And, lastly, he must thank Dr. Norman Shrive for final help and advice...|$|R
