In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.|$|E

50|$|Even with {{systems that}} do not rely on brokers, a {{subscriber}} {{might be able to}} receive data that it is not authorized to receive. An unauthorized publisher may be able to introduce incorrect or damaging messages into the pub/sub system. This is especially true with systems that broadcast or multicast their <b>messages.</b> <b>Encryption</b> (e.g. Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)) can prevent unauthorized access, but cannot prevent damaging messages from being introduced by authorized publishers. Architectures other than pub/sub, such as client/server systems, are also vulnerable to authorized message senders that behave maliciously.|$|R

In this design paper we are outlining the perspective of chat message protection through the Strongvelope module. This is different from the product (the Mega chat) and the transport means which it will be used with.

50|$|In {{the history}} of cryptography, the ECM Mark II was a cipher machine used by the United States for <b>message</b> <b>encryption</b> from World War II until the 1950s.

50|$|Secure padding schemes such as RSA-PSS are as {{essential}} {{for the security of}} message signing as they are for <b>message</b> <b>encryption.</b> Two US patents on PSS were granted (USPTO 6266771 and USPTO 70360140); however, these patents expired on 24 July 2009 and 25 April 2010, respectively. Use of PSS no longer seems to be encumbered by patents. Note that using different RSA key-pairs for encryption and signing is potentially more secure.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} models for {{managing}} cryptographic keys. S/MIME employs a model based on a trusted certificate authority (CA) that signs users' public keys. OpenPGP employs a somewhat more flexible web of trust mechanism that allows users to sign one another's public keys. OpenPGP is also more flexible in {{the format of the}} messages, in that it still supports plain <b>message</b> <b>encryption</b> and signing as they used to work before MIME standardization.|$|E
50|$|Petraeus and Broadwell used fake {{names to}} create free webmail {{accounts}} exchanging <b>messages</b> without <b>encryption</b> tools. They would share an email account, with one saving {{a message in}} the drafts folder and the other deleting it after reading it.|$|R

50|$|There are {{cryptography}} {{applications that}} {{can serve as a}} remedy to {{one or more of the}} above. For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP, SMEmail, or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end <b>message</b> <b>encryption,</b> and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.|$|E

50|$|In cryptography, the ElGamal {{encryption}} system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography {{which is based}} on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric <b>message</b> <b>encryption.</b> It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985. ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. The DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which {{should not be confused with}} ElGamal encryption.|$|E
50|$|For the {{one-time}} pad system the key {{must be at}} least as long as the <b>message.</b> In <b>encryption</b> systems that use a cipher algorithm, messages can be much longer than the key. The key must, however, be long enough so that an attacker cannot try all possible combinations.|$|R
50|$|Protocol <b>encryption</b> (PE), <b>message</b> stream <b>encryption</b> (MSE) or {{protocol}} header encrypt (PHE) {{are related}} features of some peer-to-peer file-sharing clients, including BitTorrent clients.

30|$|Won et al. {{proposed}} a new secure MIH message transport solution called MIHSec [20]. The idea of MIHSec is {{to utilize the}} Master Shared Key (MSK) generated by the L 2 authentication procedure, for generating the MIH keys. MIHsec method though has a good performance for MIH message transportation, it introduces other issues. First, it is closely integrated with L 2 authentication, thus it is not media independent. Second, the MSK needs to be securely delivered to IS by AR (access router), which means a security association should be settled apriori between each AR and IS. So the scheme does not posses scalability. Finally, in MIHsec protocol, the AR that sends the MSK to the IS may know the key for MIH <b>messages</b> <b>encryption,</b> which degrades the level of security.|$|R

Mail, AOL Mail, Gmail, Outlook and iCloud (formerly MobileMe) and it supports Exchange. iOS features a mobile version of Mail with added Exchange ActiveSync support, though it notoriously missed the functionality of attaching files to reply emails until the release of iOS 9. The iOS version of Mail {{is the most popular}} email client in the world by market share.|$|E

50|$|In cryptography, the Cellular <b>Message</b> <b>Encryption</b> Algorithm (CMEA) is a {{block cipher}} {{which was used}} for {{securing}} mobile phones in the United States. CMEA {{is one of four}} cryptographic primitives specified in a Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) standard, and is designed to encrypt the control channel, rather than the voice data. In 1997, a group of cryptographers published attacks on the cipher showing it had several weaknesses which give it a trivial effective strength of a 24-bit to 32-bit cipher.Some accusations were made that the NSA had pressured the original designers into crippling CMEA, but the NSA has denied any role in the design or selection of the algorithm. The ECMEA and SCEMA ciphers are derived from CMEA.|$|E
