5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. Mitochondrial genes are transcribed as multigenic transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs. Not all proteins necessary for <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>function</b> are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; most are coded by genes in the cell nucleus and the corresponding proteins are imported into the mitochondrion. The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome differs between species. Most mitochondrial genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, mitochondrial DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human mitochondrial genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, such as that of yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of mitochondrial tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>function</b> associated with the aging process.|$|E

Major changes include impairment of the electron transport chain and/or oxidative phosphorylation leading to decreased oxidative metabolism of various substrates, decreased ATP synthesis, and reduced hepatocyte tolerance towards stressing insults. Functional impairment of mitochondria is often accompanied by structural changes, resulting in organelle swelling and formation of inclusion in the mitochondrial matrix. Adequate <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> in hepatocytes are maintained by mitochondrial proliferation and/or increased activity of critical enzymes.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} has demonstrated a link between various disturbances in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functioning</b> and type 2 diabetes. This review focuses on a range of mitochondrial factors important in the pathogenesis of this disease. The mitochondrion {{is an integral part of}} the insulin system found in the islet cells of the pancreas. Because of the systemic complexity of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functioning</b> in terms of tissue and energetic thresholds, details of structure and function are reviewed. The expression of type 2 diabetes can be ascribed to a number of qualitative or quantitative changes in the mitochondria. Qualitative changes refer to genetic disturbances in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Heteroplasmic as well as homoplasmic mutations of mtDNA can lead to the development of a number of genetic disorders that express the phenotype of type 2 diabetes. Quantitative decreases in mtDNA copy number have also been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes. The study of the relationship of mtDNA to type 2 diabetes has revealed the influence of the mitochondria on nuclear-encoded glucose transporters and the influence of nuclear encoded uncoupling proteins on the mitochondria. This basic research into the pathogenesis of diabetes has led to the awareness of natural therapeutics (such as coenzyme Q 10) that increase <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functioning</b> and avoidance of trans-fatty acids that decrease <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functioning.</b> (Altern Med Rev 2002 : 7 (2) : 94 - 111...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{central role}} of {{mitochondria}} in basic physiological processes has rendered this organelle a receiver and integrator of multiple regulatory signals. Steroid and thyroid hormones are major modulators of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> and the question arises as to how these molecules act at the molecular level. The detection in mitochondria of steroid and thyroid hormone receptors suggested their direct action on <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> {{within the context of}} the organelle. The interaction of the receptors with regulatory elements of the mitochondrial genome and the activation of gene transcription underlies the hormonal stimulation of energy yield. Glucocorticoid activation of hepatocyte RNA synthesis is one of the experimental models exploited in this respect. Furthermore, the interaction of the receptors with apoptotic/antiapoptotic factors is possibly associated with the survival-death effects of the hormones. In addition to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, several other receptors belonging to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, as well as transcription factors with well defined nuclear actions, have been found in mitochondria. How these molecules act and interact and how they can affect the broad spectrum of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> is an emerging exciting field...|$|R
40|$|Salicylic acid (SA) {{is known}} to induce {{alternative}} pathway respiration by activating expression of the alternative oxidase gene. In the present study we report a rapid mode of action by SA on plant <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions.</b> SA at concentrations as low as 20 μm induced inhibition of both ATP synthesis and respiratory O 2 uptake within minutes of incubation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell cultures. Biologically active SA analogs capable of inducing pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance also caused rapid inhibition of ATP synthesis and respiratory O 2 uptake, whereas biologically inactive analogs did not. Inhibition of ATP synthesis and respiratory O 2 uptake by SA was insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but was substantially reduced by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting a possible role for reactive oxygen species in the inhibition of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions.</b> With exogenous NADH as the respiratory substrate, mitochondria isolated from SA-treated tobacco cell cultures {{were found to have}} normal capacities for both ATP synthesis and respiratory O 2 uptake; direct incubation of isolated mitochondria with SA had no significant effect on these <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions.</b> These results indicate that (a) the respiration capacities of isolated mitochondria do not correspond to the in vivo respiration activities in SA-treated cell cultures and (b) the SA-induced inhibition of respiration in tobacco cell cultures may involve other components that are not present in isolated mitochondria. Given the recently demonstrated roles of mitochondria in plant disease resistance and animal apoptosis, this rapid inhibition by SA of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> {{may play a role in}} SA-mediated biological processes, including plant defense responses...|$|R
25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>function.</b> Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the idea}} is controversial, some {{evidence}} suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents {{about the size of}} mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>function</b> reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.|$|E

On the molecular level there is down-regulation of various nuclear-DNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins by mutant androgen receptor (mAR), colocalization of the mAR with various mitochondrial proteins, association of mAR aggregates with mitochondria resulting in abnormal distribution of mitochondria, mtDNA depletion or multiple mtDNA deletions, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increase in reactive oxidative species, and activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway. On the clinical level various mitochondrial disorders mimic SBMA, and on the therapeutic level pioglitazone expresses PPAR-, cyclosporine-A restores mitochondrial membrane potentials, coenzyme-Q and idebenone reduce oxidative stress, and geldanamycin up-regulates protective mitochondrial heat shock proteins. In conclusion, in BSMA mitochondrial dysfunction results from various interactions of elongated poly-Q AR with mitochondria, mitochondrial proteins, nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, causing oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, or activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway.

40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) governs bile acid and energy homeostasis, {{is involved in}} inflammation, and has protective functions in the liver. In the present study we investigated the effect of Fxr deficiency in mouse precision cut liver slices (PCLS) exposed to a model hepatotoxicant cyclosporin A (CsA). It was anticipated that Fxr deficiency could aggravate toxicity of CsA in PCLS and pinpoint to novel genes/processes regulated by FXR. Methods: To test this hypothesis, PCLS obtained from livers of wild type mice (WT-PCLS) and Fxr-knockout mice (FXRKO-PCLS) were treated with 40 μM CsA for 24 h and 48 h. ATP and histological assays were applied to assess the viability of PCLS. DNA microarrays combined with bioinformatics analysis were used to identify genes and processes that were affected by CsA in WT-PCLS and/or FXRKO-PCLS. In addition, WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS {{were exposed to the}} endogenous FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and subjected to q-PCR to determine whether subsets of known FXR-targets and the identified genes were regulated upon FXR activation in an FXR-dependent manner. Results: No difference in viability was observed between WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS upon CsA treatment. Transcriptomics data analysis revealed that CsA significantly upregulated stress-response and inflammation and significantly downregulated processes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism in WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS. However, only in FXRKO-PCLS, CsA upregulated additional pro-inflammatory genes and downregulated genes related to <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, only in WT-PCLS, CDCA upregulated a subset of known FXR-target genes as well as the regulator of inflammation and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor delta (Ppar delta). Conclusions: Although FXR governs energy metabolism, no major differences in response to CsA could be observed between WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS in regulation of processes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. This finding indicates that CsA does not directly affect FXR functions in relation to the above mentioned processes. However, the more pronounced induction of pro-inflammatory genes and the downregulation of genes involved in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions</b> only in FXRKO-PCLS suggest that FXR deficiency aggravates CsA-induced inflammation and impairs <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions.</b> Therefore, FXR can exert its hepatoprotective functions by controlling inflammation and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>functions,</b> possibly involving an FXR-PPAR delta cross-talk. </p...|$|R

2500|$|One {{variation}} {{of the idea that}} mutation is the basis of aging, that has received much attention, is that mutations specifically in mitochondrial DNA are the cause of aging. Several studies have shown that mutations accumulate in mitochondrial DNA in infrequently replicating cells with age. DNA polymerase gamma is the enzyme that replicates mitochondrial DNA. A mouse mutant with a defect in this DNA polymerase is only able to replicate its mitochondrial DNA inaccurately, so that the mutation rate is 500-fold higher than in normal mice. These mice showed no clear features of rapidly accelerated aging (Kujoth et al., 2005, Trifunovic et al., 2004.). Importantly, these aged mice did not have elevated levels of ROS, suggesting that the cause of their ageing is not associated with oxidative damage, but with compromised <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Overall, the observations discussed in this section indicate that mutations are not the primary cause of aging.|$|E

During the cell differentiation, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was increased, mitochondrial membrane potential declined and respiratory chain complex IV activity was decreased. Treatment with specific inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV led to a significant inhibition in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of PMA-induced cell differentiation.
