5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E

It was still uncomfortable for me. When you're mentioned with him, I'm not sure you fully understand what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people think of her, and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in. Now that I'm an adult, I care about the inside of me ... Before I said I didn't care about what people thought about <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> really did." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Peter Martin confided, [...] "The Warped Ones baffled and mystified <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> {{liked it}} very much." [...] J.R. Jones, for The Reader's Guide to Arts & Entertainment, found the film [...] "actually celebrates the values it's {{supposed}} to be condemning," [...] but recommended it for its kineticism and action. TV Guide and Allmovie did not recommended it, both gave it one star in their respective four and five star rating systems.|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|Although {{in later}} life he had a {{reputation}} for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner. Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions. He commented, [...] "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for <b>me.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion." ...|$|E

500|$|As the Nixon {{presidency}} slowly collapsed, Voorhis {{spoke out}} more frequently. In 1972, he said, [...] "Sour grapes {{to criticize the}} man who beat <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> just wouldn't be human if I said I liked spending {{the second half of}} my life as 'the man who Nixon beat'". After Nixon resigned as President, Voorhis, noted, [...] "Here is the philosophy of doing-anything-to-win receiving its just and proper reward." [...] Voorhis, believing he had been labeled a subversive by Nixon, [...] "took some satisfaction" [...] in stating that Nixon himself had been the subversive, seeking, according to Voorhis, to impose [...] "a virtual dictatorship" [...] on the country.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{announcement}} of Windsor's departure, it was reported she wanted to take a two-year break, but after that would like to make return appearances as Peggy. However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of <b>me</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back but I like to think that 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Kristoff {{was delighted}} with his win, saying: [...] "I'm really happy to win, it's {{a really good}} feeling [...] My family is here today, {{and it was a}} big dream and my big goal this season and I managed to do it." [...] On his run-in to the finish line with Terpstra, he commented: [...] "At the end, I came with Niki, and he didn't really want to work with <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} that. In the end I could still beat him." [...] Geraint Thomas was disappointed with his performance, tweeting after the race that he [...] "just lacked the legs of last weekend", referring to his E3 Harelbeke victory.|$|E

Forgive me Lord, I am tired of this hell, this mediocre market where everyone has a price. Forgive <b>me</b> Lord <b>but</b> <b>I</b> will go with you through your mountains, your seas, and your rivers. Forgive <b>me</b> Lord <b>but</b> sometimes <b>I</b> think you have something better than this for me. Forgive me Lord, I don't {{want to be a}} citizen, I want to be a man, Lord, like you created me." ...|$|R

500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, {{if they ever}} want to tear it up, they can hold <b>me</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} {{for a number of}} years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at <b>me...</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> do love him." [...] In Jackson's other high profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.|$|E

500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> feel like it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{maintains}} that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine NME and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that since this point he has had no respect for either party. However, Albarn has suggested {{the roots of the}} feud were much more personal. By 2007, the tension between the two had cooled, and in an NME interview, Gallagher said [...] "I've got {{a lot of respect for}} Damon, I really do mean it. Because I'm indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he's a cunt. Our Liam will talk to him, I won't because he's just another singer in a band to <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't think he's a cunt. Good luck to him!" [...] On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Damon, Graham Coxon and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit [...] "Tender" [...] at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher provided backing vocals on the song [...] "We Got the Power" [...] with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, on Albarn's Gorillaz project, from their album Humanz.|$|E
