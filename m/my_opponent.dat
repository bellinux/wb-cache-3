500|$|Benjamin was {{the first}} U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. [...] In 1845, David Yulee, born David Levy, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and {{eventually}} formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin was a nonobservant Jew, {{who was not a}} member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs. [...] He rarely spoke of his religion publicly, but was not ashamed of it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on his faith come from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who related that Benjamin delivered an address in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city's Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains [...] "part of the Benjamin legend", according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an [...] "Israelite in Egyptian clothing". Benjamin is supposed to have replied, [...] "It is true that I am a Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Responding to the controversy, Allen stated: [...] "My {{record as}} a United States senator is an open book. <b>My</b> <b>opponent</b> has a record as well. He, in his advertisements, points out that he's an author, that he's a writer of books. That's part of his record. These {{passages}} in his books are part of his open record. I'll let the people of Virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with." ...|$|E
2500|$|An article which {{appeared}} in The Southeast Missourian discussed that Norton credited Napoleon Hill's philosophy for his success. To quote from the article, [...] "Norton says he's a believer in Napoleon Hill's philosophy, that a person can do anything he puts his mind to. 'So I train for my fights,' he says, 'mentally as well as physically. One thing I do is only watch films of the fights in which I've done well or in which <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> has done poorly.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Swindall won the {{election}} with 53% {{of the vote in}} what was a major upset victory for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in the 1984 elections.

2500|$|Jeffries {{remained}} mostly {{hidden from}} media attention {{until the day}} of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he could lose only if he had a lack of skill on the day. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, [...] "It is my intention to go right after <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> and knock him out as soon as possible." [...] While his wife added, [...] "I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight." [...] Johnson's words were [...] "May the best man win." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of <b>my</b> <b>opponent.</b> At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
2500|$|Pachman once {{deliberately}} let an hour run off his {{clock in}} order to use his own time trouble to lure his opponent into a swindle. In Pachman–Doda, Havana 1965, Pachman had earlier sacrificed an exchange for attacking chances. In the left-most position, Pachman had just played 27.Re1–e3?, to which his opponent responded with 27...Nd7–e5!. After that move, Pachman writes, [...] "I was suddenly aware that my position was in ruins. Black threatens to win a second exchange with 28...Ng4; since 28.fxe5 fxe5, threatening both 29...Rxf2 and 29...exd4, is hopeless for White, White must allow the knight to penetrate to d3, where it will threaten White's b and f pawns, leaving Black with a crushing position. Pachman considered resigning immediately, but saw an opportunity for a possible swindle. Since Black could easily sidestep the swindle, leaving him with a winning position, it was essential for Black to think that the move introducing the swindle was a time-trouble induced blunder. Pachman, who had over an hour for the next 13 moves, accordingly let his time go down to three minutes, [...] "the absolute minimum required in case <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> should err." [...] Pachman then played 28.Qd2, Doda responded 28...Nd3, and Pachman played 29.Nd1 immediately, [...] "in my artificially created time trouble!" [...] Doda now could have kept a winning position with (for example) 29...Bg4. Instead, he glanced at Pachman's clock, thought no more than 30 seconds, and played 29...Nxf4?, falling into Pachman's swindle. Pachman played 30.Nf5!, initiating a strong attack (see right-most diagram). Pachman writes, [...] "The rest of the game followed at lightning speed, with <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> in no way short of time but clearly depressed by the piece sacrifice." [...] The game concluded 30...gxf5 31.Rg3+ Kh8 32.Qxf4 Rb3? (better was 32...Qxe4 33.Qd2 f4 34.Rf3 and 35.Rxf4, with a strong attack) 33.Nc3 Rxb2 34.exf5 a5 35.Ne4 Re2 36.Nxf6 Rxf6? (after the better 36...Re5 37.Ng4 Rxf5 38.Nh6! Rf8 39.Rg5! wins) 37.Qg5 Re1+ 38.Kh2 1–0 ...|$|E

5000|$|The second event {{occurred}} {{while she}} was practising martial arts at the theatre.

6000|$|Dr. Pym {{jumped up}} again. [...] "Our {{authority}} {{is based on}} masses of accurate detail," [...] he said. [...] "It deals with a region in which things can be handled and tested. <b>My</b> <b>opponent</b> will at least admit that death {{is a fact of}} experience." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "that {{a plague}} was brought {{upon the earth}} after the Christian {{religion}} came into the world, and after it revealed the mysteries of hidden truth? But pestilences, say <b>my</b> <b>opponents,</b> and droughts, wars, famines, locusts, mice, and hailstones, and other hurtful things, by which the property of men is assailed, the gods bring upon us, incensed as they are by your wrong-doings and by your transgressions." ...|$|R
5000|$|There was a {{swing of}} support over to <b>my</b> <b>opponent's</b> side, {{especially}} in the educated class ... The issue was whether they wanted a PAP man as president to check on a PAP government, or {{whether it would be}} better to have a neutral independent like Chua. That's why they voted against me because I had the PAP government support. I would have been happier without the PAP's open support.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} it seemed that I could not {{withstand}} the weight of numbers that confronted me, but again, as on so many other occasions when I had been called upon to face fearful odds upon this planet of warriors and fierce beasts, I found that my earthly strength so far transcended that of <b>my</b> <b>opponents</b> that the odds were not so greatly against me as they appeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was a}} mistake," [...] said Egremont, [...] "and the cry {{was changed}} the moment <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> was on the ground. Then all the town was {{placarded}} with 'Vote for McDruggy and our young Queen,' {{as if he had}} coalesced with her Majesty." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{happened}} then I cannot exactly say. I saw <b>my</b> <b>opponent</b> spring forward like a panther and whirl his racquet. The next moment the back net was shaking violently, {{and the ball}} was rolling swiftly along the ground on a return journey to the other court.|$|E
6000|$|Tarzan {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I am {{going out to}} expiate a great wrong, Paul.

6000|$|... "So much is of course. I {{give credit}} to <b>my</b> <b>opponents</b> in Parliament for that desire quite as readily as I do to my colleagues or to myself.

5000|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, questioning Reagan's age and capacity {{to endure the}} grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president—73 at the time—while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I {{am not going to}} exploit, for political purposes, <b>my</b> <b>opponent's</b> youth and inexperience." ...|$|R
60|$|That was {{the first}} sound I had heard from human lips during all this dreadful chase, and full as it was of menace and danger {{to me it was}} a welcome sound for it broke that awful silence which {{shrouded}} and appalled me.

6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>opponent</b> was a quite undistinguished Major-General who {{relied upon}} his {{advocacy}} of Protection, and was particularly anxious we should avoid [...] "personalities" [...] and fight the constituency in a gentlemanly spirit. He was always writing me notes, apologising for excesses {{on the part}} of his supporters, or pointing out the undesirability of some course taken by mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was on my}} game to-day," [...] Lutchester admitted. [...] "With {{a little}} luck at the seventh," [...] he {{continued}} earnestly, [...] "I might have tied the amateur record.

5000|$|In 1984, former Vice President Walter Mondale won {{the first}} debate over President Ronald Reagan, in part by criticizing Reagan's age, a {{performance}} that generated much-needed donations to Mondale's lagging campaign.

I {{am not going to}} exploit, for political purposes, <b>my</b> <b>opponent's</b> youth and inexperience", which effectively negated the age issue and stalled Mondale's momentum.|$|R
