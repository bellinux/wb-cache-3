5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E

25|$|Once {{butter is}} softened, spices, herbs, or other {{flavoring}} agents can be mixed into it, producing {{what is called}} a compound butter or composite butter (sometimes also called composed butter). Compound butters can be used as spreads, or cooled, sliced, and placed onto hot food to <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> a sauce. Sweetened compound butters can be served with desserts; such hard sauces are often flavored with spirits.|$|E
25|$|However the {{dynamics}} of the movement of corium in and outside the reactor vessel is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> an underlying water pool can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of corium with water may result in a destructive steam explosion. Corium may be completely retained by the reactor vessel, or the reactor floor or some of the instrument penetration holes can be melted through.|$|E

25|$|In {{continental}} arcs, {{such as the}} Andes, magma often {{pools in}} the shallow crust creating magma chambers. Magmas in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country rock. Over time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, magma chambers must have continued recharge of hot basaltic <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> the system. When this basaltic material mixes with the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its intermediate phase.|$|E

500|$|An unusually warm winter, {{with warm}} days and cold nights, {{was also a}} factor. Water in the mountain's {{fissures}} froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports. Heavy snowfall in the region in March {{was followed by a}} warm April, causing the mountain snows to <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> the fissures. [...] GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide. [...] The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below [...] Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.|$|E

500|$|Chloi Rad of IGN {{awarded the}} game a perfect score of 10/10, {{calling it a}} {{masterpiece}} and stating that it is [...] " [...] beautiful, powerful, and cleverly designed puzzle game with a wealth of mysteries to unravel." [...] Brenna Hillier from VG247 praised the game's use of a first-person perspective to present what otherwise {{could have been a}} simple series of puzzle boards, and was impressed by the steep learning curve that the puzzles presented, [...] "impossible, incomprehensible puzzles <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> simple exercises after you’ve visited nearby locations". Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine found that there was a [...] "jarring shift" [...] once the player reached the puzzles inside the mountain, with puzzles that relied more on obfuscation in a more clinical environment, contrasting {{with the rest of the}} island.|$|E
500|$|The Nihilistic team {{used their}} {{experience}} adapting an existing property for the Star Wars games to design Redemption. Reasoning {{that most people}} would be familiar with vampire tropes, the team wrote the game assuming players would not need an explanation of the genre's common elements, while enabling them to explore White Wolf's additions to the mythos. When translating the pen-and-paper RPG to a video game, the team redesigned some of the disciplines to make them simpler to understand. For example, in the pen-and-paper game, the [...] "Protean" [...] discipline includes the abilities to see in the dark, grow claws, <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> the ground, and change into an animal, however in Redemption these were made into individual disciplines to make them instantly accessible, instead of requiring the player to select Protean and then select one of the sub-abilities.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a melodic cover of [...] "Strawberry Swing" [...] by English {{alternative}} rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with [...] "so much atmosphere you almost <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> it" [...] and then [...] "spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of an alarm clock, followed by the [...] "nightmarish" [...] song [...] "Novacane". It {{has been called a}} love song of sorts, with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn. Ocean meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, {{has no choice but to}} get gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator.|$|E

500|$|... "Baby I" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Sam Lansky of the website Idolator opined that Grande succeeded in [...] "meeting the bar where she set {{it with her}} debut," [...] while praising her [...] "extraordinary vocal performance" [...] and describing her vocal runs as [...] "nothing short of everything." [...] He also stated, [...] "Comparisons to Mariah Carey are starting to grow tiresome, but truly— who else has a range like that?" [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly praised the production of [...] "Baby I" [...] dubbing it as a throwback and felt that the song argued Grande as [...] "the new Mariah". Pitchfork's Andrew Ryce gave a positive review to the song and believed that [...] "Baby I" [...] is [...] "most representative of where Grande is {{at this stage in}} her career." [...] Ryce also noted a diversity of characteristics presents in the track, [...] "from its Britney-esque [...] "yeah yeah yeahs" [...] to the punchy horn riffs that somehow <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> a staggered hip-hop verse," [...] and further opined that [...] "Grande's boundless energy means she can power through like no one else", by using her voice as if it was nothing.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of the Phoenix shots, the crew moved to two weeks of nighttime shooting in the Angeles National Forest. Zimmerman created a village of fourteen huts to stand in for Montana; the cast enjoyed the scenes as a chance to escape their uniforms and wear [...] "normal" [...] clothes. The last location shoot was at an art deco restaurant in Los Angeles' Union Station, which stood in for the Dixon Hill holonovel; Frakes wanted a sharp contrast with the dark, mechanical Borg scenes. While the cinematographer wanted to shoot the scene in black and white, Paramount executives deemed the test footage [...] "too experimental" [...] and the idea was dropped. The site made using high-wattage lights impractical, so Leonetti opted to use dimmer master lights near the ceiling and took advantage of a large window to shine diffused lights through. To give the scene a black-and-white feel, Leonetti made sure to use light without any coloration. [...] "I like creating separation with lighting as opposed to using color," [...] he explained. [...] "You can't always rely on color because the actor might start to <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> the background." [...] By separating the backlights, Leonetti made sure that the principal actors stood out of the backdrop. The shoot used a ten-piece orchestra, 15stuntmen, and 120extras to fill the seats. Among the nightclub patrons were Braga, Moore, and the film's stunt coordinator, Ronnie Rondell.|$|E

[...] Eric [...] says that this movement must have [...] "made Mozart's hearers sit up by its daring modernities... There is a suppressed feeling of discomfort about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mahākāla is {{typically}} black in color. [...] Just as all colors are absorbed and dissolved into black, all names and forms {{are said to}} <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> those of Mahakala, symbolizing his all-embracing, comprehensive nature. Black can also represent the total absence of color, and again {{in this case it}} signifies the nature of Mahakala as ultimate or absolute reality. This principle is known in Sanskrit as [...] "nirguna", beyond all quality and form, and it is typified by both interpretations.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{conception}} of her {{many layers of}} selfhood is replicated in the multi-genres of her work. Critic Carmen Birkle wrote: [...] "Her multicultural self is thus reflected in a multicultural text, in multi-genres, {{in which the individual}} cultures are no longer separate and autonomous entities but <b>melt</b> <b>into</b> a larger whole without losing their individual importance." [...] Her refusal to be placed in a particular category, whether social or literary, was characteristic of her determination to come across as an individual rather than a stereotype. Lorde considered herself a [...] "lesbian, mother, warrior, poet" [...] and used poetry to get this message across.|$|E
