The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED One MX digital camera, which uses ambient light and has a 4.5K image resolution. Since he hoped for the premise to be authentic and [...] "as realistic as possible", Soderbergh opted not to film in the studio. [...] "There's, to <b>me,</b> <b>nothing</b> more satisfying occasionally than making someplace look like someplace else on film and having nobody know the difference." [...] For choosing cities, Soderbergh felt that they couldn't [...] "go anywhere where one of our characters hasn't been", since he wanted to portray an [...] "epic", yet [...] "intimate" [...] scenario.

She defined [...] "rock soul" [...] as encompassing multiple genres, explaining {{it as an}} attempt to combine her soulful childhood singing in church with [...] "a certain side of [...] that wants to tap into that whole rock world". She explained on Instagram that the title and lyrics for [...] "No Time for It" [...] were influenced by her beliefs: [...] "There are some things in life that I simply have 'No Time for It. In an interview with Essence, she followed this up by saying: [...] "No time for family drama. If you’re gonna be my friend, come in and be strong.

500|$|At {{the end of}} May, Island Def Jam {{pushed forward}} the release date for Graduation up from September to an {{unspecified}} late August date, a decision that West first announced on the introductory track of his Can't Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Nothing</b> mixtape. On July 19, the album's release date was changed once more and moved to September 11, 2007, the same US release date as rapper 50 Cent's third studio album Curtis. When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again {{as well as the}} idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent, West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought, saying, [...] "When I heard that thing about the debate, I thought that was the stupidest thing. When my album drops and 50's album drops, everybody wins because you're gonna get a lot of good music at the same time." [...] However, then Def Jam president and CEO Jay Z welcomed competition, feeling that it would be prosperous for hip-hop and the date became permanent.|$|E
500|$|In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be [...] "punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology {{you know}} is the eye of history". However, the system of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like [...] "Odd medical Stories", to {{organize}} anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: [...] "Life has been to <b>me</b> <b>nothing</b> but a perpetual Canvass carried on {{in all parts of}} the World - not to make Friends neither - for I have certainly found very few - but to keep off Enemies". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because [...] "Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff". However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.|$|E
500|$|The Broken Ear {{introduced}} the character General Alcazar to the series, {{who went on}} to become a recurring character who appeared in three further Adventures. It was the first in the series to begin and end in Belgium, the first to deal with the hunt for a specific object, and the last in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity. It was also the first time that the Adventures featured Tintin's flat at 26 Labrador Road, in which Chinese mementos from The Blue Lotus are visible. Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame. He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book, having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo-Ethiopian War at the start of the story; this was removed in the colour edition. At the end of the story, Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils; the killing of the story's antagonists was something not repeated in future stories. This upset the editors of Cœurs Vaillants, who asked Hergé to change the scene; annoyed at their request, he later commented, [...] "On the surface it cost <b>me</b> <b>nothing,</b> but that kind of addition was really difficult for me." [...] For their serialisation of the story, he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God.|$|E

[...] According to Einstein, the book only dealt with the concept of a personal god and not the impersonal God of pantheism. In {{a letter written}} in 1954 to philosopher Eric Gutkind, Einstein wrote [...] "the word God is for <b>me</b> <b>nothing</b> more than the expression and product of human weaknesses."

2500|$|As {{to whether}} these {{troublesome}} spots {{were due to}} the nature of the voice itself or to technical deficiencies, Celletti says: [...] "Even if, when passing from one register to another, Callas produced an unpleasant sound, the technique she used for these transitions was perfect." [...] Musicologist and critic [...] adds, [...] "Callas's 'faults' were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak, faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti's distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique." [...] In 2005, Ewa Podleś said of Callas, [...] "Maybe she had three voices, maybe she had three ranges, I don't know—I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed <b>me,</b> <b>nothing!</b> I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices, her registers, she used how they should be used—just to tell us something!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before <b>me</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters {{was released}} and people around Detroit {{began to take}} notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as Unworthy, Count It All Joy, and He Gave <b>Me</b> <b>Nothing</b> to Lose. It {{was not until the}} early 1980s that The Clark Sisters began to become more widely known. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording Is My Living In Vain. The first live recording by The Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart. Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative [...] "Hi ya" [...] was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on [...] "Speak Lord" [...] expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on [...] "Now Is The Time".
