5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air <b>masses</b> from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air <b>masses</b> can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air <b>masses</b> from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air <b>masses</b> that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air <b>masses,</b> leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

MethodsA cross-sectional study with 267 healthy students of both sexes (141 males and 126 females) aged 8 to 18 years. Weight, height, body <b>mass</b> index, lean <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass</b> index, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-to-hip ratio were evaluated. Bone <b>mass</b> was assessed using ultrasound of hand phalanges (DBM Sonic BP – IGEA, Carpi, Italy).

50|$|In rockets {{for a given}} target orbit, a rocket's <b>mass</b> {{fraction}} is {{the portion}} of the rocket's pre-launch <b>mass</b> (fully fueled) that does not reach orbit.

A rocket employing staging, which are the only designs to have reached orbit, has a <b>mass</b> fraction higher than the propellant <b>mass</b> fraction because parts of the rocket itself are dropped off en route.

5000|$|The {{invariant}} <b>mass,</b> rest <b>mass,</b> intrinsic <b>mass,</b> proper <b>mass,</b> or in {{the case}} of bound systems simply <b>mass,</b> is that portion of the total <b>mass</b> of an object or system of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system. More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total energy and momentum that is the same in all frames of reference related by Lorentz transformations. If a center of momentum frame exists for the system, then the invariant <b>mass</b> of a system is equal to its total <b>mass</b> in that [...] "rest frame". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total <b>mass</b> (a.k.a. relativistic <b>mass)</b> of the system is greater than the invariant <b>mass,</b> but the invariant <b>mass</b> remains unchanged.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mass</b> {{excess of}} a nuclide is the {{difference}} between its actual <b>mass</b> and its <b>mass</b> number in atomic <b>mass</b> units. It is one of the predominant methods for tabulating nuclear <b>mass.</b> The <b>mass</b> of an atomic nucleus is well approximated (less than 0.1% difference for most nuclides) by its <b>mass</b> number, which indicates that most of the <b>mass</b> of a nucleus arises from <b>mass</b> of its constituent protons and neutrons. Thus, the <b>mass</b> excess is an expression of the nuclear binding energy, relative to the binding energy per nucleon of carbon-12 (which defines the atomic <b>mass</b> unit). If the <b>mass</b> excess is negative, the nucleus has more binding energy than 12C, and vice versa. If a nucleus has a large excess of <b>mass</b> compared to a nearby nuclear species, it can radioactively decay, releasing energy.|$|R

AIMS: We intended to quantify the decrease in body <b>mass</b> as a loss in fat <b>mass</b> or skeletal muscle <b>mass</b> and to quantify the change in hydration status. METHODS: Body <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass,</b> skeletal muscle <b>mass,</b> haematocrit, plasma sodium and urinary specific gravity were measured in 15 ultra-marathoners in a 24 -h run. RESULTS: Body <b>mass</b> decreased by 2. 2 kg (p = 0. 0009) and fat <b>mass</b> decreased by 0. 5 kg (p = 0. 0084). The decrease in body <b>mass</b> correlated to the decrease in fat <b>mass</b> (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 0024). Urinary specific gravity increased from 1. 012 to 1. 022 g/mL (p = 0. 0005).

We conclude that the <b>mass</b> of a particle in a field changes according to the rule 2 0 / 1 (/) ff v cm m = −, where 0 fm is the rest <b>mass</b> of the particle in the field. This result is consistent with the existence of the Higgs field through the space and it causes existing particles to acquire <b>mass.</b> The confined theory is explained.
