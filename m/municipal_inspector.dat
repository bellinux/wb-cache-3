40|$|Abstract: The {{standard}} {{site investigation}} (SI) {{undertaken in the}} Netherlands for a small plot intended for a house, in the centre of The Hague, would consist of two cone penetration tests (for foundations) and two auger boreholes (for contaminated ground). Small sites may not be suited to all foundation solutions owing to varying manoeuvrability and size of piling rigs. In a vacant lot of 5 m by 10 m only a hollow steel tube-piling rig could access the site. The contractor chose this rig in preference to the design-recommended driven concrete piles, which required a much larger rig. The insertion of the steel tubes caused severe vibrations and subsidence of neighbouring structures {{to such a degree}} that the <b>municipal</b> <b>inspector</b> halted the work.

5000|$|... ==Legal principle== In {{the common}} law system, vagueness is a {{possible}} legal defence against by-laws and other regulations. The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation {{may not be so}} vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be [...] "void for vagueness" [...] and unenforceable. This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid [...] "explicit" [...] or [...] "objectionable" [...] contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving <b>municipal</b> <b>inspectors</b> discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.|$|R

40|$|Although federal, {{state and}} local {{government}} officials are subject to applicable codes of ethical conduct and are under the jurisdiction of ethics enforcement agencies created pursuant to these laws, ethics oversight agencies are limited in the breadth and scope of covered activities. With an increase in reported allegations of corruption, particularly at the local government level, this article explores the addition of the audit function, through inspectors general, to ensure greater transparency and accountability of public officials. The article begins with a very brief historical overview of the emergence of the inspector general concept in Europe and its adoption in the United States at the federal and state levels. The article continues with a focused examination of the reasons behind the creation of inspectors general at the municipal level and the various models or forms that have emerged in the establishment, jurisdiction, the operation of these offices and budget issues. The next section examines the interplay between inspectors general, ethics commissions and law enforcement agencies. Consideration is then given to the cost-benefit analysis of the <b>municipal</b> <b>inspector</b> general, exploring whether the expense can be justified by the savings and other associated benefits. Finally, the article concludes with a recommendation that in the current era of scarce fiscal resources, especially at the local level, municipalities should consider whether the establishment of an inspector general office can assist in not only furthering a commitment to ethical government, but in identifying cost-savings for the locality...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} how inventories of suspected polluted areas as a part of the planned control of existing companies cab be designed in order to achieve as great effect as possible. The study was conducted in cooperation with Piteå municipality. An analysis of regional inventory projects, local municipal strategies and a pilot study in Piteå was conducted. The experience from both the regional projects and the pilot study was that in order to achieve an effective control a number of factors were inportant: an efficient selection of companies, a good dialogue between the controlling agency and the companies, sufficient resources, education of <b>municipal</b> <b>inspectors</b> and guidance for decisionmaking. Another inportant result was that the municipal planning can prevent an efficient inventory if the control of city development projects is allowed to take time from the planned control. The conclusion was that the unit for health an environmental care in Piteå municipality should try to achieve these factors in their work and start a cooperation with the municipal planners in order to create an efficient organization for treating polluted areas. Suggested future studies was to investigate how the planning process and the work of the municipal controlling agency can be synchronized in order to achieve a common goal...|$|R

50|$|In construction, the {{authority}} having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases, {{this is the}} municipality where the building is located. However, construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During {{the construction of a}} building, the <b>municipal</b> building <b>inspector</b> inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code.

Only a few cities have SEO´s with additional schooling carrying a firearm, these officers a mostly employed in dense areas like forests. A SEO (or BOA in Dutch) has the status of civil servant and is not a uniformed civilian unlike security guards. Until 2014 every municipality could use a uniform of their choice, some where exact police uniforms with peaked caps and blue trousers with black striping. From 2015 the justice ministry created a uniform specially for municipal enforcement. This consists of a polo shirt, worker trousers, baseball cap and soft-shell jackets and were inspired by the Spanish municipal police uniforms with checkers bands on shirts and hats.|$|R
