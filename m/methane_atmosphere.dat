5000|$|Before the Huronian Ice Age, most organisms were anaerobic, {{but around}} this time, the {{cyanobacteria}} evolved photosynthesis. These bacteria {{were able to}} reproduce at exponential rates due to their new ecological niche, exploiting the near-limitless energy of the sunlight. Their photosynthesis produced oxygen as a waste product expelled into the air. At first, most of this oxygen was absorbed through the oxidization of surface iron and the decomposition of life forms. However, as {{the population of the}} cyanobacteria continued to grow, these oxygen sinks became saturated. This led to a mass extinction of most life forms, which were anaerobic, as oxygen was toxic to them. As oxygen [...] "polluted" [...] the mostly <b>methane</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and methane bonded with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, a different, thinner atmosphere emerged, and Earth began to lose heat.

40|$|A ratio {{spectrum}} of Pluto shows methane absorption bands at 6200, 7200, 7900, 8400, 8600, 8900, and 10, 000 A.

40|$|Analysis of the {{electronic}} structures of nitrogen-doped, amorphous carbon samples and of nanodiamond films are carried out {{in order to determine}} their sp 2 bonding concentration. The amorphous carbon samples under consideration are deposited onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer substrates by hot wire plasma sputtering of graphite in varying nitrogen concentration atmospheres. The deposition or modification of the substrate’s surface may lend itself to increasing hardness and wear resistance. Eventually these polymer substrates may be used for applications in the field of biomaterials, focusing on cardiovascular surgery, where a low blood/surface interaction is important. The primary technique used in this study is x-ray absorption spectroscopy, measured at the Advanced Light Source synchrotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA. A method of analyzing these spectra was then developed to determine the sp 2 bonding concentrations in carbon films. Through this newly developed analysis method, the sp 2 bonding concentrations in these samples increases from 74 to 93 % with growing nitrogen doping. The diamond films presented here are deposited on silicon wafer substrates in a <b>methane</b> <b>atmosphere</b> by microwave plasma deposition.

40|$|Amorphous {{carbonaceous}} grains {{produced in}} a <b>methane</b> gas <b>atmosphere</b> {{were analyzed by}} high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).

The onion-like structure distorted at 100 ℃, which suggested the evaporation of -OH groups included in the grains. Upon heating to 260 ℃, the centers of the onion-like grains formed holes of the order of 3 nm in size. On further heating to 550 ℃, the structure of the chained grains with a size of 10 nm changed to graphite sheets with a length of 50 nm by the surface melting coalescence among chained grains.
