40|$|The {{oriented}} carboplastics {{and methods}} of their tribotechnical investigations have been considered in the paper. The aim {{is to increase the}} wear-resistance of materials for piston seals by a means of the composition optimization, selection of composition structure, components and their relation and also development of the effective lubricants possessing a <b>metal-cladding</b> action. The tribotechnical and experimental-production tests have been performed. The influence of orientation filler on the antifrictional, thermophysical, thermofrictional properties of carboplastic has been established. The composition of antifrictional material Htibolon-B has been optimized, the <b>metal-cladding</b> compositions to the lubricants have been developed. The carbofiber Htibolon-B and <b>metal-cladding</b> compositions to lubricants have been introduced. The economic effect is 27500 roubles.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{cladding}} engineering method that flexibly modifies the radiation patterns {{and rates of}} <b>metal-clad</b> nanoscale optical cavity. Optimally adjusting the cladding symmetry of the <b>metal-clad</b> nanoscale optical cavity modifies the modal symmetry and produces highly directional radiation that leads to 90 % coupling efficiency into an integrated waveguide. In addition, the radiation rate of the cavity mode can be matched to its absorption rate by adjusting {{the thickness of the}} bottom-cladding layer. This approach optimizes the energy-flow rate from the waveguide and maximizes the energy confined inside the nanoscale optical cavity...|$|R

50|$|Between 1930 and {{the start}} of World War II, the urban tobacco {{landscape}} in Lexington grew dramatically. The consolidation in the tobacco markets meant that Lexington, a rail and road hub, benefited from a building boom of new, mostly <b>metal-clad</b> warehouses. This includes both sales and storage warehouses. The introduction of the <b>metal-clad</b> steel-frame brick-firewall storage warehouse with multiple sections under one roof, rippled throughout Lexington's burley storage landscape. The Harpring Warehouse began receiving tobacco during the 1930 sales season, and its design was quickly co-opted by other companies. In 1931, other national tobacco firms commenced building similar storage warehouses.|$|R

50|$|A few {{airships}} {{have been}} <b>metal-clad,</b> with rigid and nonrigid examples made. Each kind used a thin gastight metal envelope, {{rather than the}} usual rubber-coated fabric envelope. Only four <b>metal-clad</b> ships {{are known to have}} been built, and only two actually flew: Schwarz's first aluminum rigid airship of 1893 collapsed, while his second flew; the nonrigid ZMC-2 built for the US Navy flew from 1929 to 1941 when it was scrapped as too small for operational use on anti-submarine patrols; while the 1929 nonrigid Slate Aircraft Corporation City of Glendale collapsed on its first flight attempt. Both nonrigid ships nevertheless had strong metal monocoque envelopes which, while they maintained their shape uninflated, required an overpressure during flight.|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{effects in}} <b>metal-clad</b> {{semiconductor}} nanolasers Abstract: As {{the field of}} semiconductor nanolasers becomes mature {{in terms of both}} the miniaturization to the true sub-wavelength scale, and the realization of room temperature devices, the integrated treatment of multi-ple design aspects beyond pure electromagnetic consid-eration becomes necessary to further advance the field. In this review, we focus on one such design aspect: tempera-ture effects in nanolasers. We summarize recent efforts in understanding the interplay of various temperature-dependent parameters, and study their effects on opti-cal mode and emission characteristics. Building on this knowledge, nanolasers with improved thermal perfor-mance can be designed, and their performance evaluated. Although this review focuses on <b>metal-clad</b> semiconduc-tor lasers because of their suitability for dense chip-scale integration, these thermal considerations also apply to the broader field of nanolasers...|$|R
