40|$|Variable Angle Tow (VAT) {{laminates}} {{that generally}} exhibit variable stiffness properties not only provide extended design freedom, but also offer beneficial stress distributions. In this paper, {{the prospect of}} VAT composite panels with significantly reduced loss of in-plane compressive stiffness in the postbuckled state in comparison with conventional structures, is studied. Specifically, we identify that both thickness and local fiber angle variation are required to effectively define “buckle-free” panels under compression loading. In this work, the postbuckling behaviour of variable thickness VAT composite panels is analyzed using an efficient and robust semi-analytical approach. Most previous works on the postbuckling of VAT panels assume constant thickness. The additional benefits of tailoring thickness variation {{in the design of}} VAT composite panels are seldom studied. However, in the process of manufacturing VAT laminates, either by using the conventional Advanced fiber Placement (AFP) <b>machine</b> (<b>tow</b> overlap) or the newly developed Continuous Tow Shearing (CTS) process (tow shrink) thickness build-up is inevitable. The postbuckling optimization for the design of VAT layups is conducted by a two-level framework using lamination parameters as intermediate design variables. The objective is to determine optimal lamination parameters and thickness distributions for maximizing the axial compressive stiffness of VAT laminates that are loaded in the postbuckling regime. The thickness variation due to both manufacturing of VAT laminates and for where it is independent of manufacturing process are considered. In accordance with the first-level optimal postbuckling solutions in terms of lamination parameters, we investigate a practical “buckle-free” VAT panel using a blended layup configuration. This blended VAT panel consists of a piecewise combination of segmental CTS layers and constant-thickness VAT layers. The prospect of taking advantage of a benign combination of stiffness and thickness to improve the overall compressive strength of VAT panels is studied. Finally, the optimal results are analysed to provide insight into the manufacturing of VAT laminates using either the AFP or the CTS process for improved postbuckling stiffness under compression loading...|$|E

5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow <b>machines</b> that <b>tow</b> snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composite}} shells that may offer {{the potential to}} improve the structural performance of future aircraft fuselage structures were developed under this joint NASA-industry collaborative effort. Two cylindrical shells with tailored, tow-steered layups and continuously varying fiber angle orientations were designed and built at the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing - Louisiana Partnership. The shells were fabricated from unidirectional IM 7 / 8552 graphite-epoxy pre-preg slit tape material fiber-placed on a constant-diameter mandrel. Each shell had the same nominal 8 -ply [plus or minus 45 /plus or minus Theta]s layup, where the nominal fiber angle in the tow-steered plies varied continuously from 10 degrees along the crown to 45 degrees on each side, then back to 10 degrees on the keel. One shell was fabricated with all 24 tows placed during each pass of the fiber placement machine, resulting in many tow overlaps on the shell surface. The fiber placement <b>machine's</b> individual <b>tow</b> cut/restart capability was also used to manufacture a second shell with tow drops and a more uniform laminate thickness. This paper presents {{an overview of the}} detailed design and manufacturing processes for these shells, and discusses issues encountered during their fabrication and post-cure evaluation. Future plans for structural testing and analyses of the shells are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Terragrader (Pty) Ltd {{developed}} a working prototype for a machine {{capable of making}} and upgrading earth roads. The working prototype was based on practical engineering sense and any available components {{in order to produce}} a “concept proving” machine. As a consequence, a new working prototype was required which would include sound mechanical engineering design to address mass production requirements and any operational and maintenance issues. To achieve a sound prototype design, extensive research regarding earth road construction and maintenance was conducted. This dissertation documents the design and development of the new working prototype for a machine which will mechanically refurbish existing earth roads or create new earth roads in rural or informal areas in South Africa. The concept consists of a wheeled <b>machine</b> <b>towed</b> behind a commercial tractor. The tractor will provide the pulling force required to: • tear up (scarify) the existing earth road/ground. • grade and form the road shape. • stabilize the formed earth road by light compacting. The hydraulic pressure needed to actuate the machine is provided by the hydraulic power system integrated into the tractor. The machine will require a tractor driver, and one operator sitting {{at the rear of the}} machine. From this position the operator is able to observe and control every aspect of the earth road manufacturing process. It is envisaged that the production machine will be operated and maintained by semi skilled/unskilled workers, therefore, the new production working prototype must take this into account. The project, when implemented by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd will include training and instruction on the use and maintenance of the production machine. The research part of the project was done within several complimentary fields to gain a full understanding of the design requirements and constraints. The following complimentary fields were researched: • To determine the requirements of earth road design in South Africa, • To understand the make up of the earth conditions in South Africa, the types of road defects, the repair and construction methods applied in South Africa. • The amount of pulling force required to perform a grading, scarifying and compacting operation. As a consequence, a number of formulae and recommendations were identified and were utilized to quantify the pulling force required, thereby confirming that the tractor chosen by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd was adequate. • The types of existing road construction machinery have been researched and documented. A survey of the current commercially available earth construction machinery, in particular Graders, has been conducted to identify operating capacities, and compare these with the design criteria as specified. • Since the first working prototype was based on “engineering sense” only, mechanical engineering design practice was used to ensure that all initial design shortcomings and deficiencies were addressed to facilitate mass production, operation and maintenance. As this dissertation is being completed, the new production working prototype is being manufactured and any difficulties or improvements are being addressed and integrated into the design. The manufacturing of this second prototype will be completed towards the end of 2007, with the design finalization taking place once the prototype testing is completed...|$|R

Additional 18 tractors were attached to various tank units, mostly the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade for towing of immobilized tanks and for transport of tanks to the battlefield on specially designed towing platforms. Finally, two tractors were delivered to the engineering units for road maintenance and destruction of railways in case of a war. Until 1942 additional 52 were to be delivered to various communal services, where they were to be used as snowplows to keep the roads in good condition in case of a war.

The ships could lift up to 150 tons off {{the bottom of the}} ocean with its main bow rollers and an additional 30 tons on its auxiliary bow rollers. A recompression chamber was available for treating diving related sicknesses and the MK-5 Surface Supplied Diving System was in use.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of how power system stabilizer (PSS) able {{to stabilize the}} power system efficiently during the transmission line is an important area of research in power operation and planning. One of the essential works of power system security is to operate and handle information on fault detection effectively. In the proposed thesis, the oscillation for <b>tow</b> <b>machine</b> in “one phase fault”, “Fault with and without PSS”, “Fault with and without SVC”, are recorded at various fault locations. Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) Wave Transform is used for fault detection. The MRA analyses the signal, where the statistical features for different locations and condition of the fault are extracted efficiently. The features are fed to Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) {{to act as a}} fault classifier. The features are set as input vectors and the locations are set as the target. Graphic User Interface is used to monitor the whole system. When the fault is classified using PNN, its location can be used to generate control signals for PSS, which will be used to improve the stability in the power system. Therefore, this work shows the new techniques in detecting, classifying, and locating faults in a transmission line based on PSS signals as compared to traditional methods...|$|R
5000|$|During the 19th century, {{the village}} {{gradually}} expanded following {{the introduction of}} larger scale industries to the area, including manufacture of machinery for flax mills in 1811. [...] James Low and Robert Fairweather had set up their foundry in the village {{at the start of}} the nineteenth century and in 1815 developed the first carding <b>machine</b> for flax <b>tow</b> in the area. With the growth of the textile industry in Dundee and Angus the business grew rapidly, and, by the late nineteenth century, James F Low & Co Ltd was producing a wide range of machines used for the processing and spinning of jute, flax and similar fibres. As well as building machinery for local use, the firm attracted orders from across the world and by the 1880s the Monifieth Foundry employed about 300 workers. The expansion of Monifieth's industrial economy was aided by the opening of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on 6 October 1838. This railway, which was originally intended only as a local line, was constructed with an unusual gauge of [...] (shared only with the Arbroath and Forfar Railway), later being converted to standard gauge when it was incorporated into the national Rail system. Between 1861 and 1901, Monifieth's population more than tripled; from 558 to 2,134 and in 1895, Monifieth was registered at Forfar Sheriff Court as a burgh. A tramway service was introduced in 1905, with cars journeying into Dundee City centre at regular intervals. This service was welcomed by the many who travelled daily either from the Burgh into the City on business, or the many hundreds who commuted daily to work in the factories and mills.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘…Leeds {{is just as}} {{tranquil}} {{as though}} no Strike had ever been, and as though no ‘yeos’, ‘blues’ or bayonetteers had been imported…The bells ring and the shops open, and mill tyranny goes on, {{and those who have}} any employment go to it, and those who have none starve quietly and patiently in the streets…’. But the economic situation remained difficult for the manufacturers too. The Leeds Mercury in the late 1830s and early 1840s carried many public notices of auctions of the equipment of bankrupt firms, which showed that they had been using - and so were now dumping on the second-hand market - machinery made by Taylor Wordsworth and Co, among others. Wordsworth was one of six machine-makers who were reported by the Mercury to have gone to London in February 1843, to the Board of Trade, to ask Lord Ripon for the law to be changed to allow the export of English-made flax and <b>tow</b> <b>machines</b> - in view of ‘the depressed state of the trade in that important branch of manufacturing industry’. [...] This was a complete turn-around in the manufacturers' position; in January 1827 Taylor Wordsworth and Co had joined many other Leeds manufacturers in publicly lobbying against a planned Bill to legalise the export of machinery, noting that 'great Danger may accrue to the Manufacturing Interests of the Kingdom if such Bill passed into a Law'. [...] Times were hard. A 'calamitous fire' at the company's works in February 1844 didn't help; but the firm had invested in a Leeds Water Works Company 'Fire Plug' (an early sort of hydrant, located in the factory), which averted complete disaster and which the company warmly recommended to others in the newspaper's account. Joshua Wordsworth had been appointed a Director of the Leeds Water Works in 1841.|$|R
