5|$|Adobe {{walls were}} {{historically}} made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement <b>mortars,</b> but cement <b>mortars</b> will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E

50|$|Bricks, stone blocks, {{and other}} masonry units are {{typically}} laid {{in a bed}} of <b>mortar.</b> The process of placing a masonry unit in a <b>mortar</b> bed causes the <b>mortar</b> to be extruded between units. This excess <b>mortar</b> is cleared and shaped before the <b>mortar</b> hardens. In some cases, the bedding <b>mortar</b> {{is meant to be}} seen and the <b>mortar</b> joint is immediately given a finish profile. In other cases, especially where the <b>mortar</b> is pigmented, the bedding <b>mortar</b> is removed from the joint before it hardens (usually a depth that averages about one inch), and then pointing <b>mortar</b> is applied in the void and shaped with a finish profile.|$|R
5|$|The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in {{conjunction}} with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17.

5|$|The 9th Infantry Regiment {{had planned}} Task Force Manchu on {{orders from the}} 2nd Division {{commander}} Major General Laurence B. Keiser, which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling. Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the Paekchin ferry. The 9th Infantry reserve, E Company, reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company, {{was to be the}} attack force. The 1st Platoon, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31. Two heavy weapons companies, D and H, were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns, one section of 81-mm. <b>mortars,</b> and one section of 75-mm. recoilless rifles for supporting fires.

5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas <b>mortars</b> were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas <b>mortars</b> were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was shot at a high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|E
40|$|The {{moisture}} transport in <b>mortar</b> and <b>mortar</b> joint {{often is}} an important parameter in degeneration of brick masonry and other block constructions. In this study, the influence of single additives on the moisture transport properties of <b>mortar</b> is investigated. Due to water extraction during brick laying, curing conditions of <b>mortar</b> in <b>mortar</b> joint differ from curing conditions of separately cured <b>mortar.</b> Consequently, the moisture transport properties of <b>mortar</b> joint differ. In addition to the moisture transport in <b>mortar</b> and <b>mortar</b> joint, the moisture transport in brick masonry is investigated. Experimental moisture profiles of water absorption in brick masonry indicate {{that there is no}} perfect hydraulic contact at the brick-mortar interfaces...|$|R
50|$|A <b>mortar</b> carrier, or {{self-propelled}} <b>mortar,</b> is a {{self-propelled artillery}} piece {{in which a}} <b>mortar</b> is its primary weapon.

5000|$|Although good-quality bricks may outlast civilizations, the <b>mortar</b> that bonds {{them can}} crack and crumble {{after a number}} of years. Water {{penetration}} is the greatest degrader of <b>mortar,</b> and different <b>mortar</b> joints allow for varying degrees of water-resistance. For maintenance, degraded <b>mortar</b> joints need to be renewed by removing the old <b>mortar</b> and applying new <b>mortar,</b> a process known as [...] "repointing".|$|R
5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly.

5|$|ZIPRA {{personnel}} in Bulawayo used civilian vehicles to smuggle weapons and equipment, including <b>mortars,</b> into their Entumbane camp {{over the next}} few days. C Company, 1RAR, comprising 96 men under Major Lionel Dyck (including a detachment from Support Company) and eight armoured vehicles, noticed this while they were garrisoning the Alamo on 11 February. The major reported to Brigade headquarters that the number of ZIPRA troops at Entumbane appeared to have swelled considerably, and that the chain link fence surrounding the camp had been taken down. Superiors ordered him not to intervene. Anticipating an imminent attack, Dyck used a silenced rifle to shoot out the floodlights surrounding the Alamo, lined up his vehicles against the surrounding walls so his men could stand on them while defending, and ranged <b>mortars</b> on a variety of targets in the ZIPRA complex.|$|E

50|$|Sound <b>mortar</b> {{normally}} {{does not}} need to be removed from a building during the repointing process, although such a practice is common. The new <b>mortar</b> should be designed to match the <b>mortar</b> type, color and texture of the existing <b>mortar</b> to avoid incompatible materials and visual aberrations. The professional repointing process begins with a <b>mortar</b> analysis where a sample is taken and examined to identify the components, ratio, and aggregate. The old <b>mortar</b> is removed to a depth equal to or slightly more than the width of the joint, or to the point where sound <b>mortar</b> is reached. Depths greater than 2-1/2 inches or 4cm should be filled in several passes, allowing the <b>mortar</b> to cure for at least 24 hours depending on the <b>mortar</b> type. The joint profile would be as rectangular as possible as the new pointing <b>mortar</b> should be allowed ample opportunity to bond with the masonry unit.|$|R
