5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although yet to play county cricket in England, Jaffer has {{represented}} Scholes CC in the Huddersfield Drakes League {{for a number}} of seasons as their overseas player. For the 2010 season he moved a few <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Skelmanthorpe Cricket Club, and broke the league record for runs scored in a single season. In the 2011 season Jaffer signed to Himley CC in the Birmingham and District Premier League.|$|E
25|$|As {{the highway}} {{approaches}} Bridgeport {{from the south}} it joins up with US26 to cross the North Platte River. On {{the south side of}} town, US26 continues to the west where it passes Chimney Rock National Historic Site just twelve <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Continuing north across the river the two highways diverge, with US26 heading east towards Broadwater and Ogallala while US385 resumes its northward heading. For a brief few miles the roadway is, again, surrounded by agricultural fields, brought to life with center pivot irrigation north of Bridgeport. The highway transitions into slightly rugged terrain as it climbs back up, 400 feet, out of the valley.|$|E

25|$|Herbert was {{presented}} with the Prebendary of Leighton Bromswold in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1626, whilst {{he was still a}} don at Trinity College, Cambridge but not yet ordained. He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding, two <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from Leighton Bromswold, to found the remarkable community with which his name has ever since been associated. Herbert raised money (including the use of his own) to restore the neglected church building at Leighton.|$|E
500|$|African-American {{travelers}} faced real physical risks {{because of}} the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, {{and the possibility of}} extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners [...] "in their place". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as [...] "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee".|$|E

We’d go on weekend breaks to Three Cliffs Bay – six <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road!</b> That’s how gorgeous it is." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1995 {{serial killer}} Rosemary West, wife of Fred West, {{was held in}} Winchester on remand for the {{duration}} of her trial in Winchester Crown Court.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Double Duty had {{to endure}} racial segregation. In every city except Saint Paul, Minnesota, {{he and his colleagues}} had to stay in {{segregated}} hotels and eat in segregated restaurants. It was difficult to get cabs at night. He also faced racist hostility from players and has claimed that, among others, [...] "Ty Cobb didn't like colored people". Radcliffe also recalled stopping the team car to buy gas in Waycross, Georgia. When the players tried to drink water from the car wash hose, the owner of the gas station told them, [...] "Put that hose down—that's for white folks to drink." [...] Radcliffe told a Boston Globe interviewer: [...] "After that, I refused to buy gas from him. About four <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> the gas ran out and we had to push the car five miles." ...|$|E

The trooper's name is Sean Pierce.|$|R
50|$|Runcie {{was born}} and spent his early life in Great Crosby, Lancashire, to middle-class and rather non-religious parents. He {{initially}} attended St Luke's Church, Crosby (where he was confirmed in 1936), before switching to the Anglo-Catholic St Faith's Church about a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> He was educated at Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{arranged}} for {{that portion of}} the business. Your knapsack, well filled by your mother, and everything you may need during a few weeks in the woods, is hidden a couple of <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> I brought the things as far away from the farm as I thought necessary, and then left them in the bushes." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Mrs. Carson {{came up and}} told us that the stage had stopped there, and that she had managed to give the passengers some coffee, bread and butter and ham and eggs, though they had had to wait their turns for cups and plates. It appeared that the driver had quarreled with the Lowry people that morning because the breakfast was behindhand and he was kept waiting. So he told his passengers that there was another tavern, a few <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> and that he would take them there to breakfast.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning they struck off from the road they had been following and, travelling for sixteen hours, came down on it again {{at the foot of}} the pass of Bejar; and learned from some peasants that they had got ahead of the French column, which was encamped two or three <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Before daybreak they were on their way again, and reached Banos in the afternoon. There were but few inhabitants remaining here; for the requisitions for food and forage, made by the troops that had so frequently passed through the defiles, were such that the position of the inhabitants had become intolerable and, when they learned from Garcia that two divisions of French troops would most probably arrive that evening, and that Marmont's whole army would follow, most of the inhabitants who remained hastily packed their most valuable belongings in carts, and drove away into the hills.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Near {{enough for}} a Minister of the Queen. But {{remember}} she gave the lads full time to change their minds. She was three long days at Rye Royal--knighting of fat Mayors.

Chris Hatton, poor fool, was vexed at it.|$|R
60|$|Soon Adele {{was sitting}} before a fire bright with logs freshly thrown on. The horses, still saddled, {{were placed in}} a shed with an ample {{allowance}} of food.

50|$|Cooper's Brooklands {{connections}} later {{blossomed into}} a partnership with Alfa Romeo racer Ginger Hamilton. With Hamilton's assistance, in 1934 Cooper moved his business to new premises about a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> new garage and Vauxhall Motors dealership that Cooper built on wasteland behind 243 Ewell Road, which opened onto Hollyfield Road, was to become {{the heart of the}} Cooper operation right through its glory years.|$|R
60|$|He dipped {{his hand}} into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner. They came back by way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first {{experience}} of sea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well persuaded he had been poisoned. The Babu's famous drug-box proved useless, though Kim had restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at Quetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps a little over, by spending four curious days as scullion {{in the house of}} a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in an auspicious moment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out--it seemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales--by moonlight, lying behind an outhouse, all through one hot night. Then he returned the ledger to its place, and, at Mahbub's word, left that service unpaid, rejoining him six <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> the clean copy in his bosom.|$|E
