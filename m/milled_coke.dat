50|$|Integration was the watchword as {{the various}} {{processes}} were brought together by large corporations, from mining the iron ore to shipping {{the finished product}} to wholesalers. The typical steelworks was a giant operation, including blast furnaces, Bessemer converters, open-hearth furnaces, rolling <b>mills,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens and foundries, as well as supported transportation facilities. The largest ones were operated in the region from Chicago to St. Louis to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Buffalo. Smaller operations appeared in Birmingham, Alabama, and in California.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} half of the twentieth century, several widely publicized acute episodes of lethal smogs spurred public {{understanding}} of the hazards of air pollution. One of the earli-est such events occurred from 1 December to 5 December 1930 in the Meuse Valley in Belgium (1). Stable atmospheric conditions and industrial pollution from steel <b>mills,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens, foundries, and smelters in Liege, Belgium, contributed to the accumulation of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO 2), sulfuric acid mists, and fluoride gases. In the last 2 days of the event, more than 60 persons died, which was more than 10 times the normal mortality rate (2) ...|$|R
50|$|Special duct loading {{conditions}} may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal <b>mills,</b> <b>coke</b> grinding facilities, {{and to some}} extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5 ft. to 15 ft. in diameter, and 20 ft. to 30 ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} several decades, growth and {{advancement}} indicated a thriving city. As the steel <b>mill</b> and <b>coke</b> production facilities expanded, the population of Clairton grew. Clairton took {{on a life of}} its own, including a business district and educational, religious, and cultural facilities. The city peaked in the late 1950s, and has been in decline since.|$|R
50|$|Clairton’s {{existence}} began {{just after}} the turn of the 20th century when the Crucible Steel Company acquired a large tract along the west side of the Monongahela River, about 13 mi south of Pittsburgh. Soon after, the Carnegie Steel Company (later U.S. Steel) built an integrated steel <b>mill</b> and <b>coke</b> production facility, which eventually became one of the world's largest.|$|R
30|$|Phenolic {{derivate}} {{belong to}} a group of common chemicals which is characterized by the presence of the hydroxyl group (–OH) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group. These compounds have a high antioxidant capacity, and their role in human health and disease is a subject of research. For this reason, there is an increasing interest in recovering of phenolic compounds from some industrial wastewaters by adsorption, such as olive mill wastewater [1, 2]. On the other hand, the presence of their even low concentration can be an obstacle to the use and/or reuse of water. Phenols cause unpleasant taste and odour of drinking water and can exert negative effects on different biological processes [3]. Most of these compounds are recognized as toxic carcinogens. Industrial sources of contaminants such as oil refineries, petrochemical, steel <b>mills,</b> <b>coke</b> oven plants, coal gas, synthetic resins, pharmaceuticals, paints, plywood industries, etc. generate large quantities of phenols [4].|$|R
50|$|Until the mid-1980s, SYSCO {{along with}} its predecessors, Hawker-Siddley, DOSCO, BESCO, and DOMCO/DISCO, was a user of coke as a fuel for the <b>mill's</b> blast furnaces. <b>Coke</b> is {{produced}} by slowly baking coal, evaporating or leaching out various liquids in the process.|$|R
50|$|By 1912, 80% of Japan's {{pig iron}} {{production}} was from Yahata. An integrated <b>mill</b> with <b>coke,</b> iron, and steel facilities, Yahata was also responsible {{at this time}} for 80-90% of Japan's steel output. Energy efficiency was greatly improved by the conversion from steam to electricity as a power source, resulting in a drop in consumption of coal per ton of steel produced from four tons in 1920 to 1.58 in 1933. Much of the iron ore was from China and Korea.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, a BOS rolling <b>mills</b> and <b>coke</b> ovens were constructed, {{enabling}} the Whyalla plant {{to become a}} fully integrated steelworks. In 1965, the largest ship ever built in Australia, the Darling River was launched at the Whyalla shipyards. With the launching of the tanker Arthur Phillip in 1974, the Whyalla shipyard passed a major milestone, having produced over one million tonnes of merchant vessels. The shipyard also produced the world's first gas turbine-electric powered ship, the Seaway Prince in 1975.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Cambridge on {{the death}} of his father, he entered the family's {{engineering}} business, Simon Carves, manufacturers of flour <b>milling</b> machinery and <b>coke</b> ovens.

5000|$|The phrase [...] "Coke Region" [...] {{is based}} on the area's fame for {{producing}} coke (fuel) from coal needed in the making of steel. The coke industry suffered a major blow in the 1920s when coke was obtained from the coal burned to heat steel mill ovens and those facilities were built adjacent to Pittsburgh's steel <b>mills.</b> The <b>coke</b> making [...] "beehive" [...] facilities that dotted West Penn's trolley territory were rendered nearly obsolete. The trolleys had fewer passengers to take to work, and a decline in passenger business began in earnest.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1970s, the {{environmental}} movement was gaining headway in North America, and concern about pollution from the steel <b>mill</b> and <b>coke</b> ovens was rising. Environmental activists would subsequently uncover documents showing {{that the government was}} aware of environmental problems caused by the steel plant and coke ovens as early as 1972. In 1980, scientists from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a family of chemicals produced by incomplete combustion of organic material, in lobster caught in Sydney Harbour near Muggah Creek. They ordered the South Arm of the harbour closed to lobster fishing, and fingered the Tar Ponds as the likely source of contamination.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s {{the steel}} {{industry}} began to decline. As the industry packed up, so did business and many residents. Like many areas in the rust-belt, Hazelwood fell into disrepair. Hazelwood was home {{to the city of}} Pittsburgh's last operating steel <b>mill,</b> the Hazelwood <b>Coke</b> Works, which was owned by Jones and Laughlin and later, its parent company, LTV, when it closed in 1998.|$|R
50|$|The {{steel mill}} was {{responsible}} for the neighbourhood's economic growth during the 20th century but it is also responsible for its economic decline as well. From the steel mill's inception in 1901 until the mid-1980s, the mill was fueled with coke, a byproduct of cooking raw coal over a multiple hour period. To do this, coal was shipped by the Sydney & Louisburg Railway (and later the Devco Railway) from the mines to a large battery of coke ovens bordering the railway lines {{on the south side of}} the neighbourhood along Frederick Street on a hill overlooking the steel <b>mill.</b> The <b>coke</b> ovens produced coke for the steel mill's oxygen blast furnaces 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for almost 90 years.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Savage Iron Works {{operated}} from 1837 to 1868 in Mount Savage, Maryland. The ironworks {{were the}} largest in the United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for construction of railroads. The works were established in an area adjacent to mines for coal, iron ore and fire clay. Facilities included blast furnaces, puddling furnaces, a rolling <b>mill,</b> iron refineries, <b>coke</b> production and brick production.|$|R
50|$|The coals of the Pocahontas {{coalfield}} {{developed a}} good reputation, and by 1903, U.S. Steel {{had set up}} a subsidiary named U.S. Coal and Coke to mine coal in central McDowell County. The operations centered around Gary, with numbered coal mines/camps surrounding the central coal town of Gary like coal town suburbs. Wilcoe was Gary No. 1, Ream was Gary No. 6, Elbert was Gary No.8, and Venus was Gary No. 10 and Thorpe was No.11. At first the coal was baked in beehive coke ovens at the mine site and shipped to the steel <b>mills</b> as <b>coke</b> (much as U.S. Steel had done in the Connellsville coalfield in Pennsylvania). After 1918 the coal was shipped by rail to the massive coke works at Clairton. The captive mines of U.S. Steel in the Gary area continued to thrive until the 1980s, when they were closed and Gary began an economic decline.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II {{the village}} became a {{residential}} district for builders {{of a new}} steelworks company - Východoslovenské železiarne Košice (VSŽ Košice - [...] "Eastern Slovak Iron Works in Košice"). In January 1960 construction started on more than 8 square kilometres of land. In 1965 the first blast furnace was fired up and production in the hot rolling <b>mill</b> and <b>coke</b> plant was started. In four decades the Košice mill has developed into a steel-producing plant that has managed to reach the markets and achieve a position among the significant steel producers. It has been accepted {{as a member of}} prestigious international organizations associating iron and steel producers and has become a partner of renowned foreign firms in joint ventures.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the relative risk}} of death from work related injury in a steelworks, associated with exposure to various occupational hazards, sociodemographic factors, and medical history. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a nested case-control design. It {{was based on a}} cohort of men employed in the steel plant of USIMINAS, Brazil between January 1977 and August 1990, who were followed up to November 1992. The cases were defined as all workers in the cohort who died from injury in the study period and whose death had been notified to the Brazilian Ministry of Labour as being related to work. Four controls per case, matched to cases on year of birth, were randomly selected from among workers employed in the plant at the time of death of the matching case. Data on potential risk factors for occupational injury were extracted from company records; for the controls these data were abstracted for the period preceding the death of the matching case. RESULTS: There were 37 deaths related to work injuries during the study period. Four surviving workers were selected as controls for each case, but for eight the personnel records were incomplete, leaving 140 controls in all. Significantly increased risk of fatal injury related to work was associated with exposure to noise, heat, dust and fumes, gases and vapours, rotating shift work, being a manual worker, and working in the steel <b>mill,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens, blast furnaces, and energy and water supply areas. Risk of fatal injury related to work increased with intensity of exposure to noise (P (trend) = 0. 004) and heat (P < 0. 001), and increased greatly with a hazard score that combined information on noise, heat, dust, and gas exposure (P < 0. 001). Number of years of schooling (P = 0. 03) and salary level (P = 0. 03) were both negatively associated with risk. In a multivariate analysis including all these significant factors, only hazard score and area of work remained associated with death from injury related to work. The highest risks were for men exposed to all four environmental hazards (odds ratio (OR) 19. 4; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 to 352. 1) and those working in the energy supply area (OR 18. 0; 1. 6 to 198. 1). CONCLUSIONS: The study identified parts of the steelworks and types of hazard associated with greatly increased risk of fatal accident. Research and measures to prevent accidents need to concentrate on these areas and the people working in them. The use of a hazard score was successful in identifying high risk, and similar scoring might prove useful in other industrial situations...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} 10 {{years since the}} JK size-dependent {{breakage}} model was developed (Shi and Kojovic, 2007). This series of papers present 20 applications of {{the model for the}} mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the size reduction as the equipment model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer <b>mill</b> for <b>coke</b> feed preparation, a vertical spindle mill for coal pulverised fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation. The energy-size reduction modelling approach permits the simulations of the effects of changes in ore/coal and machine operating conditions on comminution product size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} (EAF) dust, {{together}} with a <b>mill</b> scale and <b>coke</b> were smelted in a laboratory electric arc furnace. These metallurgical wastes consist of a many different phases and elements, making the reaction process complex. Thermo-chemical analysis of the reactions in metal, slag, and gas phases was done, and used for modeling of the mixture composition and energy consumption required for smelting. Modelling was performed with the software named RikiAlC. The crude ZnO, slag, and metal phase were analyzed using the atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), the optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES), the X-ray diffraction (XRD), the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and reflected and transmitted light microscopy. Also, in order to follow the behavior of this process the exhausted gases were monitored. The synergetic effects of the designed mixture may be recognized in minimizing energy consumption for the smelting process, improving the product yield efficiency, and reducing the negative environmental effects...|$|R

50|$|In 1896, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited had {{acquired}} {{land on the}} river shore at Mayfield East for smelters, and in 1910 {{it was decided that}} they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton blast furnace and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail <b>mill,</b> with by-product <b>coke</b> ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and South Maitland coalfields, (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to dredge and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, 500 ft wide and 25 ft deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired 1225 acre. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.|$|R
40|$|AbstractImpacts of {{industrial}} emissions on outdoor {{air pollution in}} nearby communities are well-documented. Fewer studies, however, have explored impacts on indoor air quality in these communities. Because persons in northern climates spend a majority of their time indoors, understanding indoor exposures, {{and the role of}} outdoor air pollution in shaping such exposures, is a priority issue. Braddock and Clairton, Pennsylvania, industrial communities near Pittsburgh, are home to an active steel <b>mill</b> and <b>coke</b> works, respectively, and the population experiences elevated rates of childhood asthma. Twenty-one homes were selected for 1 -week indoor sampling for fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and black carbon (BC) during summer 2011 and winter 2012. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine contributions from both outdoor concentrations and indoor sources. In the models, an outdoor infiltration component explained 10 to 39 % of variability in indoor air pollution for PM 2. 5, and 33 to 42 % for BC. For both PM 2. 5 models and the summer BC model, smoking was a stronger predictor than outdoor pollution, as greater pollutant concentration increases were identified. For winter BC, the model was explained by outdoor pollution and an open windows modifier. In both seasons, indoor concentrations for both PM 2. 5 and BC were consistently higher than residence-specific outdoor concentration estimates. Mean indoor PM 2. 5 was higher, on average, during summer (25. 8 ± 22. 7 μg/m 3) than winter (18. 9 ± 13. 2 μg/m 3). Contrary to the study's hypothesis, outdoor concentrations accounted for only little to moderate variability (10 to 42 %) in indoor concentrations; a much greater proportion of PM 2. 5 was explained by cigarette smoking. Outdoor infiltration was a stronger predictor for BC compared to PM 2. 5, especially in winter. Our results suggest that, even in industrial communities of high outdoor pollution concentrations, indoor activities – particularly cigarette smoking – may play a larger role in shaping indoor exposures...|$|R
