5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> combinatorics.|$|E

25|$|The Edict of Nantes, {{issued on}} April 13, 1598, by Henry IV of France, granted Protestants—notably Calvinist Huguenots—substantial rights {{in a nation}} where Catholicism was the state religion. The main concern was civil unity; The Edict {{separated}} civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king. The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population {{during the second half of}} the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrayal}} of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in {{a vision of a}} hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.|$|E
40|$|The value {{problem in}} {{epistemology}} is {{to explain why}} knowledge is <b>more</b> valuable <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> true belief. Or so it is commonly construed. Various solutions to the quandary have been proposed, but so far none has gained wide acceptance. Perhaps, then, we should abandon the idea that knowledge is <b>more</b> valuable <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> true belief. This is what we shall argue, but with one important qualification: Knowledge is not generally <b>more</b> valuable <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> true belief. Certain epistemic contexts, however, are ruled by diachronic aspects of the truth goal of believing. In these contexts the properties that turn a true belief into knowledge add extra value to the belief. For example, {{in addition to the}} truth of a belief currently under consideration we are often interested in the subject 2 ̆ 7 s future performances as a reliable epistemic agent. According to the contextualist account of epistemic values we propose, epistemological value monism can be preserved. But the value problem should be reformulated. The task is not to explain why, but rather whenknowledge is <b>more</b> valuable <b>than</b> true belief...|$|R

500|$|Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States {{interpret}} the same term {{in their respective}} constitutions broadly. In the United States Supreme Court case Munn v. Illinois (1877), Justice Stephen Johnson Field stated that the term life means <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be [...] "construed in any narrow or restricted sense". Indian courts have likewise adopted a broad interpretation of life in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> existence – instead, it includes the right to livelihood {{and the right to}} a healthy environment. Subsequently, in Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1997), the meaning of life was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati held in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984) that the expression life included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the Directive Principles of State Policy that appear in the Indian Constitution.|$|E
500|$|In 1862 Whistler {{had met the}} English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, {{with whom}} he {{developed}} a close friendship. The {{relationship between the two}} was mutually beneficial. Inspired by Whistler's Little White Girl, Swinburne wrote a poem with the title [...] "Before the Mirror". Before the painting went on exhibition at the Royal Academy, Whistler pasted the poem written on gold leaf onto the frame. The idea of decorating a painting's frame with a poem was one Whistler had gotten from Rossetti, who had similarly pasted a golden paper with one of his poems on the frame of his 1849 painting The Girlhood of Mary. To Whistler, this poem underlined his idea of the autonomous nature of the painted medium. It showed that painters were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> illustrators, and that visual art could be an inspiration for poetry, not just the other way around.|$|E

[...] Cavna particularly praised the episode for being based on real-life publishing, noting how Selman drew inspiration from the article on Alloy Entertainment. He also commended the parodies of the Ocean's Trilogy and Far Side, and Gaimain's guest appearance. Cavna wrote that [...] "Gaiman’s role is so much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> walk-on. Like the show’s very best guest voice performances, here Gaiman is called upon to lend true dimension to the episode." [...] Similarly, Cyriaque Lamar of io9 wrote that the episode [...] "did justice to Gaiman's guest appearance...in that it made the author look like a total nutcase." [...] He added that [...] "Gaiman gamely depicts himself as a goony spaniel. Sure, Andy García guest-starred too, but Gaiman stole the show."
