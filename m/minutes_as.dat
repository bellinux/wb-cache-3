5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three <b>minutes,</b> <b>as</b> Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E
5|$|Born in East Ham, London, Jones was {{rejected}} {{as a youth}} team player at Colchester United before impressing the coaches at Queens Park Rangers (QPR). He made his professional debut on 22 April 2006, coming on for the final seven <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> a substitute for Steve Lomas in a 1–2 home loss to promotion-chasing Watford. Eight days later, he made his only other appearance of the season, coming on for Stefan Bailey in the 68th minute of a defeat by the same score away to the already-crowned winners of the Football League Championship, Reading.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} with Shrewsbury, Davis {{extended}} his contract with Wolves until 2013. He made his debut for the club in the League Cup second-round tie away to Northampton Town on 23 August 2011, coming off the bench {{for the last few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> Wolves won 4–0. A week later, he made yet another loan move, this time to Scottish Premier League (SPL) side Inverness Caledonian Thistle until January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 <b>minutes.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
5|$|Marquinhos {{began the}} 2014–15 season on 2 August in the Trophée des Champions, playing the whole 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> PSG won 2–0 against Guingamp at the Workers Stadium in Beijing. In the 32nd minute, he gave away a penalty kick by fouling Claudio Beauvue, but Salvatore Sirigu saved the penalty shot from Mustapha Yatabaré. His first {{goal of the}} season came in a 2–0 win at Caen on 24 September, heading in Javier Pastore's corner.|$|E

The rule stating that performers also {{must not have}} previously released music commercially was active from 2003 to 2006. This rule was dropped in 2007 thus allowing already experienced singers and bands in the competition. As a result, NRK chose {{to withdraw from the}} contest.|$|E
5|$|A {{pre-season}} unofficial friendly match provided Tomkins {{his first}} experience against top-flight opposition {{as he came}} off the bench during Lee Briers' testimonial match in a 30–22 loss to Warrington. Noble followed this up by providing Tomkins, aged 19, with his first team début on 12 May against Whitehaven in a fifth round Challenge Cup match. Tomkins became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut, scoring his first three to complete a hat-trick within the first twelve <b>minutes,</b> <b>as</b> Wigan scored eighteen tries in total {{on the way to}} a 106–8 victory.|$|E
5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session on Friday afternoon. Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made it into the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Against Northamptonshire {{in one of}} {{the last}} games of the 1920 season, Surrey had passed Northamptonshire's score and were in a {{dominant}} position when Fender batted. He was dropped early on but batting in a carefree, aggressive style, reached 100 runs in 35 <b>minutes,</b> <b>as</b> of 2016 still the fastest individual century on record in first-class cricket. In total, he scored 113 not out and shared a partnership of 171 runs in 42 minutes with Alan Peach. Although acknowledged to be a fast innings, Fender's century was not recognised as a record at the time; cricket records were not widely kept or studied, and other innings were believed to have been quicker. Surrey {{went on to win the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Anfield hosted Manchester City in {{the fifth}} round. It {{was the start of}} a decisive week for Liverpool, as they faced Roma midweek in the UEFA Cup, then Birmingham City in the 2001 Football League Cup Final. Liverpool were awarded a penalty after five <b>minutes,</b> <b>as</b> goalkeeper Nicky Weaver fouled Vladimír Šmicer inside the 18-yard box. Jari Litmanen {{converted}} the spot kick to give Liverpool the lead, which quickly became 2–0 when Heskey's shot found its way past Weaver. Andrei Kanchelskis' goal in the 28th minute halved the scoreline, but Šmicer and Markus Babbel each scored in the second half to put Liverpool in a commanding lead. City persisted and in stoppage time scored their second goal of the match; Shaun Goater's deflected shot did enough to beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.|$|E

He replaced Radek Bejbl in the second group match, against France, coming on after 49 minutes in the 2–1 loss. Lokvenc appeared in the third group match against Denmark, although due to both teams having lost both of their previous matches, neither team could advance to {{the next round of}} the competition. He came on after 79 minutes, replacing Vladimír Šmicer in a 2–0 win for his nation.|$|E
5|$|Babangida's {{international}} {{chances were}} partly limited {{due to the}} fact that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the pecking order. He played an important role in his team's Olympic triumph in Atlanta in 1996, as Nigeria overcame tough resistance from Brazil and Argentina, packed with the likes of Dida, Roberto Carlos, Bebeto, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Hernan Crespo, Claudio López, Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone among others. Babangida took part in Nigeria's 1998 World Cup campaign, playing a total of 120 <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> he started one game and came on as a sub in the other three. He scored his team's only goal in the second-round defeat to Denmark. In January 2001, Babangida appeared in an exhibition game at the Yokohama International Stadium (known as the Nissan Stadium nowadays), playing for FIFA XI in a game against the unified team of Japan and South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Booth {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with 16 goals and 30 points over 62 games. Having never qualified for the playoffs with the Panthers previously in his career, Booth made his post-season debut in 2012. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings, he recorded one assist over five games as the first-seeded Canucks were eliminated in the first round. Booth told reporters prior to the playoffs that he was struggling with his diminished role with the Canucks, in comparison to his time with the Panthers, alluding to his ice time. The previous year, he was averaging nearly 19 minutes per game, which dropped to 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten <b>minutes</b> <b>as</b> the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
