40|$|Broadband circuit {{models for}} {{electric}} machines are effective means to understand, predict, {{and control the}} phenomenon of conducted Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) from immunity/susceptibility perspective. These models should cover the capacitive and inductive coupling behavior of the component along the frequency band of interest. The circuit models when used under generic SPICE simulation softwares, are very helpful for design-related and troubleshooting activities. In this paper the inductive coupling for a winding on a laminated ferro-magnetic core prototype has been investigated and analyzed with aid of the freely available FEMM software package. Inductive coupling analysis resulted in the generation of a complex-numbered inductive coupling matrix expressing a certain wiring arrangement. This is achieved by automatically generating the desired geometry and assigning boundary conditions for the problem under FEMM through Lua scripting language and then solving for magneto-static and time-harmonic magnetic cases for both self- and <b>mutual-inductances</b> for every conductor in the multi-conductor system.

The d- and q- axis apparent self- and <b>mutual-inductances,</b> Ld, Lq, Ldq and Lqd, are predicted by finite element analysis for various d- and q-axis currents. The error in the estimated rotor position of the four machines is investigated and compared when (a) the {{influence of}} magnetic saturation is neglected, (b) only the {{influence of the}} dq-axis current on Lq is considered, but dq-axis cross-coupling magnetic saturation is neglected, and (c) the influence of dq-axis cross-coupling magnetic saturation is taken into account. It is shown that the error is more strongly influenced by the q-axis current/permeance than the dq-axis current/permeance, since the dq-axis current does not distort the symmetrical field distribution about the q-axis, and that dq-axis cross-coupling magnetic saturation can significantly affect the accuracy of the rotor position estimation. However, by introducing an apparent mutual winding inductance in the extended back-EMF based sensorless method, the error in all four machines under consideration is reduced significantly, to a similar level to that which results with surface-mounted magnet machines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Geometrical {{modeling}} of induction machines under eccentricity conditions involves {{a significant number}} of self and mutual inductances. These inductances are functions of rotor angular position, and calculating them at each time step requires solving computationally-intensive definite integrals. Conventional techniques use numerical look-up tables, or employ approximated analytical expressions such as limited-term Fourier series expression of turn functions. The former approach needs large memory volume given the size of inductance matrix. Moreover, numerical interpolations are needed upon model execution, which significantly slows down the simulation. The later technique is computationally tasking for a large set of Fourier series terms, or lacks sufficient accuracy if only a few terms are used. Alternatively, computationally efficient closed-form solutions for self- and <b>mutual-inductance</b> expressions are presented here. The step variations of turn functions are considered which streamlines the model formulation. The experimental results validate the proposed model. In particular, the frequency spectrum of the stator current illustrates the ability of proposed technique to detect eccentricity. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} Hamiltonian {{is derived}} for two coupled three-Josephson-junction (3 JJ) qubits. This {{is not quite}} trivial, for the customary "free" 3 JJ Hamiltonian is written {{in the limit of}} zero inductance L. Neglecting the self-flux is already dubious for one qubit when it comes to readout, and becomes untenable when discussing inductive coupling. First, inductance effects are analyzed for a single qubit. For small L, the self-flux is a "fast variable" which can be eliminated adiabatically. However, the commonly used junction phases are_not_ appropriate "slow variables", and instead one introduces degrees of freedom which are decoupled from the loop current to leading order. In the quantum case, the zero-point fluctuations (LC oscillations) in the loop current diverge as L-> 0. Fortunately, they merely renormalize the Josephson couplings of the effective (two-phase) theory. In the coupled case, the strong zero-point fluctuations render the full (six-phase) wave function significantly entangled in leading order. However, in going to the four-phase theory, this uncontrollable entanglement is integrated out completely, leaving a computationally usable <b>mutual-inductance</b> term of the expected form as the effective interaction.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{formulas}} {{are proposed}} for the self- and <b>mutual-inductance</b> calculations of a helical toroidal coil by direct and indirect methods at superconductivity conditions. The direct method {{is based on the}} Neumann’s equation, and the indirect approach is based on the toroidal and the poloidal components of the magnetic flux density. Numerical calculations show that the direct method is more accurate than the indirect approach at the expense of its longer computational time. Implementation of some engineering assumptions in the indirect method is shown to reduce the computational time without loss of accuracy. Comparison between the experimental, empirical, and numerical results for inductance, using the direct and the indirect methods, indicates that the proposed formulas have high reliability. It is also shown that the self-inductance and mutual inductance could be calculated in the same way, provided that the radius of curvature is greater than 0. 4 of the minor radius and that the definition of the geometric mean radius in the superconductivity conditions is used. Plotting contours for the magnetic flux density and the inductance show that the inductance formulas of the helical toroidal coil could be used as the basis for coil optimal design. Optimization target functions such as maximization of the ratio of stored magnetic energy with respect to the volume of the toroid or the conductor’s mass, the elimination or the balance of stress in certain coordinate directions, and the attenuation of leakage flux could be considered.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 High voltage {{transmission}} system availability and system security are key performance criteria for electricity utilities worldwide. System disturbances {{need to be}} cleared quickly and accurately in order to minimise the impact of faults and to facilitate speedy system restoration. In this context, the South African utility, Eskom has maintained a process of refreshing protective relaying technology as older equipment becomes obsolete {{and is no longer}} capable of meeting the utility’s requirements. The difficulties which a process of equipment renewal presents the organisation with include the risk of incorrectly applying the newer technologies within the complex electrical network. The application of new technology is affected by the complexities of the newer technology with respect to the older, more familiar technologies. Some of the difficulties can be addressed with revised commissioning procedures or the use of modern test equipment. Enhanced relay algorithms and settings calculation methodologies can however not be simplified. Protective relay maloperations cannot always be completely avoided and when they do occur, these must be investigated and addressed to prevent future recurrences. The research covered by this dissertation focuses on a number of protective relay maloperations on transmission lines using impedance protection algorithms. The research undertaken identifies the previously unidentified causes of the maloperations and describes a relay settings solution for improving the accuracy of the protective relays. The methodology that was followed in the research covers the following aspects: • Identification and highlighting of some of the protection relay maloperations that occurred during system faults, • Review of the fundamental principles involved in system fault analysis, • Comprehensive study of the theory involved in the calculation of an overhead line conductor self and <b>mutual-inductance,</b> as well as the calculation of the positive, negative and zero sequence impedances of an overhead line, • Brief evaluation of the effect of load impedance on relay measurements and the impact on fault clearing operation, • Analysis of the theoretical operation of various numerical relays during singlephase- to-earth faults in radial and meshed (complex) network conditions, • Mathematical calculations using typical Newton-Raphson methods to study the impact of resistive single-phase-to-earth faults on the voltage and current measurements at the relaying position with the exclusion of the capacitive components between conductors and conductors and earth, • Comparison and evaluation of mathematical calculations and system studies using network simulation software which included all steady state network parameters, • Review and analysis of actual system faults that had been previously analysed without definitive conclusion. The faults were re-analysed in an attempt to correlate findings with the hypothesis of the research, • Comparison of the performance of protective relay impedance charactersitics using positive sequence domain versus loop domain analysis techniques. This study concluded that significant benefits can be achieved by analysing system faults and relay operation using loop quantities in primary impedance values as opposed to positive sequence or apparent impedance quantities in secondary values. The inherent differences between the positive or apparent impedance characteristics of the relays are nullified when considered in the loop impedance domain, provided that the relays reach settings were calculated correctly. The study also showed that load current cannot be ignored when calculating settings as it has significant impact on the actual impedance measured during fault conditions. It is therefore crucial that when relays from different manufacturers are being used to protect the same circuit that the differences between the relays and the subsequent measurements are clearly understood and compensated for. Finally relay setting changes have been proposed for implementation based on the findings of this research. The combination of the theory, network simulations and secondary injections performed on the relays all correlate and therefore validate the research. It is left for the utility and or users of these relays to evaluate the results of this research and implement the necessary changes as applicable. Master...|$|E
