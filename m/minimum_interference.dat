30|$|Motivated by {{the above}} open problems, this paper proposes a {{combined}} CQ-PNC and STBC {{system for the}} two-hop two-way relay system. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. First, based {{on the concept of}} CQ-PNC [3] we derive a PNC mapping rule for two pairs of network coded symbols. Second, we propose an adaptive mapping scheme based on <b>minimum</b> residual <b>interference</b> power to reduce the effect of quantization error. This adaptive scheme differs from those of [3, 12] in that we propose the <b>minimum</b> residual <b>interference</b> power as a metric for adaptation while both the previous works use the quantization step. Finally, a relay selection method based on <b>minimum</b> residual <b>interference</b> power is proposed as a solution to increase further the system performance. Simulation results confirm the performance improvement of the proposed scheme.|$|R

The inherently sequential structure of wavelet theory does not merge efficiently with modern techniques such as parallel processing, concurrent programming and implementation in design tools. In this paper a real-time signal processing technique adopting a fast parallelized algorithm for QRS complex locations is presented.

50|$|DECT {{provides}} dynamic {{channel selection}} and assignment; {{the choice of}} transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the mobile terminal. In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the mobile terminal (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or intercell handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30 s intervals to generate a RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) list. When a new channel is required, the mobile terminal (PP) or base station (FP) selects a channel with the <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> from the RSSI list.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} techniques offering QoS routing is <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> routing. However, it is complex in terms of computation time and is not oriented toward improving the network protection level. In order to include better levels of protection, new <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> routing algorithms are necessary. Minimizing the failure recovery time is also a complex process involving different failure recovery phases. Some of these phases depend completely on correct routing selection, such as minimizing the failure notification time. The level of protection also involves other aspects, such as the amount of resources used. In this case shared backup techniques should be considered. Therefore, <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> techniques should also be modified in order to include sharing resources for protection in their objectives. These aspects are reviewed and analyzed in this article, and a new proposal combining <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> with fast protection using shared segment backups is introduced.
