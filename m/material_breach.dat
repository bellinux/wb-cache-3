2500|$|In June 2008, Anthony Puzo, son {{of author}} Mario Puzo, sued Paramount Pictures, {{claiming}} that a 1992 agreement between {{his father and}} Paramount entitled the author (or, as Mario had died in 1999, his estate) to {{a share of the}} profits generated from any audio-visual products based on or using elements of the films or novels. The court filing stated, [...] "In <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of the audio-visual products agreement, Paramount has failed and refused to pay the Puzo Estate the sums due it in respect of the Godfather game." [...] In February 2009, Puzo won the suit, with Paramount paying out an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the region of several million dollars.|$|E
2500|$|On June 29, 2015, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi {{announced}} that the club had exercised its right to terminate Richards's contract, which had five years remaining, for [...] "a <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of his Standard Player's Contract." [...] The termination resulted from an incident at the US-Canada border in which Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Richards for possession of oxycodone, a controlled substance, without a prescription. Richards' 12-year, $69 million contract, which he had signed in 2008 while captain of the Philadelphia Flyers, had $22 million remaining on it when it was terminated. On August 10, it was {{announced that}} the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) had filed a grievance on behalf of Richards to contest the contract termination. On October 9, 2015, the Kings announced they had reached a settlement with Richards thus making him a free agent.|$|E

The EU, for example, has rules governing the voluntary withdrawal of members, but says nothing about whether a member can be expelled. As a matter of international law, what does the silence mean? Put differently: What is the default rule regarding expulsions when a treaty says nothing about forced withdrawals? Is there an absolute bar on expulsion, as some have suggested? Conversely, is there an implicit right to expel? Or can <b>material</b> <b>breaches</b> of a treaty justify expulsion?

50|$|On March 17, 2003, Peter Goldsmith, Attorney General for England and Wales, set out his government's legal {{justification}} for {{an invasion of}} Iraq. He said that the 1990 Security Council Resolution 678 authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 Resolution 687, which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the facts on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Resolution 1441 {{stated that}} Iraq was in <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of the ceasefire terms {{presented}} {{under the terms}} of Resolution 687. Iraq's breaches related not only to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but also the known construction of prohibited types of missiles, the purchase and import of prohibited armaments, and the continuing refusal of Iraq to compensate Kuwait for the widespread looting conducted by its troops during the 1990-1991 invasion and occupation. It also stated that [...] "...false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further <b>material</b> <b>breach</b> of Iraq's obligations." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} deals with First Nations, notably Tobique, on whose reserve lands dams had been {{constructed}} in the 1950s without a formal written contract, was also problematic. The longstanding arrangement had been that Tobique reserve itself and its residents would not pay any electric power bills whatsoever, forever, and this had been respected at least through 2000. However, after the reorganization of NB Power, {{there was at least}} one attempt to bill Tobique residents for power use, indicating that the longstanding arrangement was being unilaterally breached by NB Power's successor corporations. The proposed sales of the dam to Hydro Quebec either under the original deal (to sell all of NB Power) or the second deal (to sell only some generating assets including Tobique) also constituted <b>material</b> <b>breaches</b> of these arrangements, leaving Tobique at least in an unassailable bargaining position to set new terms for access to the river and rights of way used to transmit power from it.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} the first monograph on British propaganda for Spain during the Second World War, {{as part of}} the British war effort to diminish Nazi influence in Spain and to keep Franco out of the war or to defer his entry as long as possible. From his appointment as ‘special’ ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare’s personal appeasing initiatives quickly escalated into a systematic and well-organised propaganda organisation with headquarters at the Madrid embassy. With the help of the embassy staff, Hoare managed to establish an important network of contacts that ensured that British propaganda <b>material</b> <b>breached</b> Franco’s restrictions and reached Spaniards from all classes and regions. As this study argues, the embassy’s propaganda successes were mainly {{due to the fact that}} the propagandists knew how to adjust British interests to Spanish customs and norms. For instance, this thesis will give detailed account on the functioning of some peculiar methods of propaganda such as the so-called Religious Propaganda and the Embassy Medical Service. Lastly, this study will also analyse the propagandists’ constant exposure to violent aggressions at hands of the police and the members of the Falange, as well as their struggle to keep British opinion as neutral as possible regarding Spain...|$|R

40|$|Phytosanitary {{legislation}} is widely {{thought to be}} the most effective means of limiting the entry of alien pathogens without hindering trade. However, there is increasing evidence of limitations and weaknesses in phytosanitary systems worldwide. One such case is the entry and establishment of Colletotrichum acutatum in the UK in the 1980 s. To investigate this further, data sets of disease incidence gathered by the authorities responsible for plant health between 1984 and 2008 were analysed to determine how and why the pathogen entered the UK and became established on strawberries. Results suggest that the disease entered the UK in 1982 on plants originating from the USA, a year earlier than the first UK record of the disease was reported. At least 54 further cases of infested plant <b>material</b> <b>breached</b> phytosanitary procedures and entered the UK, 75 % of which originated from EU countries. Moreover, internal trade transmission was found to be highly influential in the successful spread of the disease. The effectiveness of phytosanitary procedures is limited when the sector is importing large numbers of plants from nurseries that have a track record of selling infested plant material, even if they are accompanied by a plant passport. By taking greater responsibility in limiting the spread of quarantine diseases, nurseries throughout the EU have an important role to play in limiting the entry of alien pathogens...|$|R

After examining the major deficiencies of {{the attempts to}} restrict illegal pornographic representations, the authors aim to highlight that the debate regarding their availability in the Internet era neglects the lucrative nature of the circulation of such material, which can be also targeted through anti-money laundering. Rising profits fuel the need to recycle the money back into the legal financial system, {{with a view to}} concealing their illegal origin. Anti-money laundering laws require disclosure of any 'suspicion' related to money laundering, thus opening another door for law enforcement to reach the criminal...|$|R

The test of essentiality requires that the promise (term) was of such importance to the promisee {{that he or she}} would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of strict or substantial performance of the promise and this ought to have been apparent to the promisor. This is an objective test of the parties' intention at the time of formation of the contract.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the fuel}} {{elements}} of a reactor begin to melt, the fuel cladding has been breached, and the nuclear fuel (such as uranium, plutonium, or thorium) and fission products (such as cesium-137, krypton-85, or iodine-131) within the fuel elements can leach out into the coolant. Subsequent failures can permit these radioisotopes to breach further layers of containment. Superheated steam and hot metal inside the core can lead to fuel-coolant interactions, hydrogen explosions, or water hammer, any of which could destroy parts of the containment.
