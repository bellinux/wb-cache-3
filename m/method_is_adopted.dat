For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa - Capricorn.|$|E

5000|$|Near/far field approximations {{are fixed}} by the {{analytical}} {{calculation of the}} Gaussian beam Rayleigh length and by its comparison with the input/output propagation distance. If the ratio between input/output propagation distance and Rayleigh length returns [...] the surface wavefront maintains itself nearly flat along its path, which means that no sampling rescaling is requested for the phase measurement. In this case the beam {{is said to be}} near field at the observation point and angular spectrum <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>adopted</b> for the propagation. At contrary, once the ratio between input/output propagation distance and Gaussian pilot beam Rayleigh range returns [...] the surface wavefront gets curvature along the path. In this case a rescaling of the sampling is mandatory for a measurement of the phase preventing aliasing. The beam is said to be far field at the observation point and Fresnel diffraction is adopted for the propagation. Fraunhofer diffraction returns then to be an asymptotic case that applies only when the input/output propagation distance is large enough to consider the quadratic phase term, within the Fresnel diffraction integral, negligible irrespectively to the actual curvature of the wavefront at the observation point.|$|E

[...] The VLS system on Type 052D differs from that on Type 052C. The circular-shaped VLS system on Type 052C is replaced by the VLS with rectangular cells on Type 052D. [...] Moreover, this box-like VLS looks different from the VLS system of Type 054A. [...] Photos show that Type 052D's VLS system does not contain the shared exhaust vents between the rows of launching tubes, which is the common feature of Type 054A's VLS. [...] Instead, the VLS on Type 052D looks more similar to the American Mk 41 VLS, but without obvious indication of exhausts. The lack of exhaust vents in the leaked photos leads to some Chinese internet forums postulating the cold launch <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>adopted</b> on Type 052D, but such claims cannot be confirmed by independent or official sources.|$|E
