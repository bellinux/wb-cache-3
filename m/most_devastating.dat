5|$|During the First World War, {{a number}} of barracks and {{voluntary}} hospitals were set up around the city, and in 1917 a German bomber crash-landed near Broad Oak Road. During the Second World War, 10,445bombs dropped during 135 separate raids destroyed 731 homes and 296 other buildings in the city, including the missionary college and Simon Langton Girls' Grammar Schools, and 115people were killed. The <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> raid was on 1 June 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili {{was both}} the second deadliest {{and the second}} <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> {{hurricane}} of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season (Isidore killed 22 people and damaged $1.3 billion worth of property). A total of 13people died in the Caribbean Islands, and 2 more {{were killed in the}} United States. Severe damage to crops and livestock occurred through the Lesser Antilles, and damage to buildings and other infrastructure was reported in other Caribbean nations and the United States.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. The <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E

5|$|In 1236 a large Mongol {{army was}} {{collected}} under the supreme leadership of Batu Khan and set {{forth to the}} west, {{in one of the}} greatest invasions in world's history. The Mongols’ <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> attacks against the western territories of the Desht-i Quipchaq (‘the steppe of the Cumans’) took place in 1237–1238. The development of the battles was not recorded in the sources, but the Cuman's subsequent migration to Hungary, Bulgaria and other neighboring territories is eloquent enough. Although some Cuman groups survived the Mongol invasion,the Cuman aristocracy was slain. The steppes of eastern Europe were conquered by Batu Khan's army and became parts of the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester {{suffered}} several serious fires: in 1613, {{caused by}} a tallow chandler's cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, {{caused by a}} soap boiler. The 1613 fire was the <b>most</b> <b>devastating,</b> resulting {{in the destruction of}} 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity). Only a few of the town's early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys' lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The Town Hall was erected in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was {{regarded}} as the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} on 27March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was {{the final}} and <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. The {{previous}} war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrow II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrow proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia, the Aegean Sea and even before the walls of Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons lost 34–19 to the Denver Broncos {{two weeks}} later in Super Bowl XXXIII. Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in {{overtime}} to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 NFC Championship Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> losses in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|World War I was the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> in British {{military}} history, {{with nearly}} 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed {{and was replaced}} first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
50|$|Other {{issues such}} as {{environmental}} degradation remain prominent. Maldives Human Development Report 2000 highlighted the poor irrigation system at place which is still unchanged. Also, Maldives State of the Environment Report 2002 highlighted the severe beach erosion problem faced by the island (notably the biggest island in Raa Atoll). Moreover, December 2004 - Indian Ocean tsunami left the island as the second <b>most</b> <b>devastated</b> in the atoll.|$|R

5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Betsy was {{the strongest}} and <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane {{in the history of the}} United States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} success at Unsan, {{the rest of}} the Chinese forces {{advanced}} across the US lines, intending to push the US forces back across the Ch'ongch'on River and into Pyongyang. But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the Chinese to disengage on 5 November, thus ending the Chinese First Phase Campaign. Besides the victory at Unsan, the Chinese First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong. In return, the Chinese had suffered 10,700 casualties {{by the end of the}} Chinese First Phase Campaign. The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> US losses of the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|From February 3 to March 3, 1945, Manila was {{the site}} of the bloodiest battle in the Pacific theater of World War II. Some 100,000 civilians were killed in February. At the end of the battle, Manila was recaptured by joint American and Philippine troops. It was the second <b>most</b> <b>devastated</b> city in the world, after Warsaw, during the Second World War. Almost all of the {{structures}} in the city, particularly in Intramuros, were destroyed.|$|R

5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, possibly the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> one Macedonia has ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned during the three following centuries but along with the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E
5|$|The first system, an operationally unnoticed {{subtropical}} storm, developed {{north of}} The Bahamas on June1 and dissipated {{by the following}} day without impact. Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June30 and dissipated on July4, after causing minor affects in North Carolina. Hurricane Bill was a short-lived storm between that lasted from July11 to July13 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland. As Bill as dissipating, Tropical Storm Claudette developed and caused rough seas in North Carolina. The <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> storm was Hurricane Danny, which caused extensive flooding, particularly in southern Alabama. Danny resulted in 9fatalities and about $100million (1997USD) in damage. The outerbands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles, causing two deaths and $10million in losses. The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused minor flooding in Puerto Rico. Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storms Fabian did not impact land. Collectively, the storms of the 1997Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12fatalities and approximately $111.46million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The sack of Amorium {{was one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> {{events in}} the long history of Arab raids into Anatolia. Theophilos {{reportedly}} fell ill soon after the city's fall, and although he recovered, his health remained in poor state until his death, three years later. Later Byzantine historians attribute his death before the age of thirty to his sorrow over the impact of the city's loss, although this is most likely a legend. The fall of Amorium inspired several legends and stories among the Byzantines, and can be traced in surviving literary works such as the Song of Armouris or the ballad Kastro tis Orias ("Castle of the Fair Maiden"). Arabs on the other hand celebrated the capture of Amorium, which became the subject of Abu Tammam's famous Ode on the Conquest of Amorium. In addition, caliphal propaganda made use of the campaign to legitimize al-Mu'tasim's rule and justify his subsequent murder of his nephew and the rightful heir to al-Ma'mun, al-Abbas.|$|E
