40|$|The {{study was}} set up to {{investigate}} the awareness of elderly patients and medical doctors of <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> to driving. Separate questionnaires were completed by patients and doctors. All were interviewed face-to-face, without prior warning and their immediate answers were recorded. In total, 150  elderly patients from the acute elderly care wards, rehabilitation wards and day hospital, and 50  doctors (including all grades from consultant to junior house officer) were interviewed. The main outcome measures were numbers of patients currently driving and previously driving; patients' awareness of how their medical condition affected their ability to drive; doctors' spontaneous knowledge of medical conditions which restrict driving, current licensing policy, and restrictions for five specific medical conditions (epilepsy, myocardial infarction, stroke, 5 -cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, and diabetes). Only 21  patients were current drivers, and six of these should not have been driving. While 103  perceived themselves eligible to drive, 46  had <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> to driving. Seventeen of the 47  patients who perceived themselves not eligible to drive possibly did not have restrictions to driving. Doctors' knowledge of the current licensing policy and action to be taken if a patient was not eligible to drive was very poor. Knowledge of <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> to driving was scanty, with few doctors giving the correct driving restrictions for the five specific conditions.

40|$|AIM: To review {{exercise}} {{performance and}} exercise habits {{in patients with}} congenital heart disease (CHD). BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Physical exercise and physical activity has shown beneficial effects on the physical, psychological and social level in adult patients with cardiovascular disease. Favourable effects have also been documented in children with CHD. Exercise testing is preferentially performed on a treadmill in children, with the measurement of gas exchange. RESULTS: An overview of the literature showed that formal exercise testing has frequently documented reduced or suboptimal values for aerobic exercise performance in children with left-to-right shunts (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect), valvular heart disease and obstructive anomalies (aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, coarctation of the aorta). Subnormal values for exercise tolerance have also been observed in patients with successfully repaired cyanotic heart disease (tetraology of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, Fontan operation). An important contributing factor to the impaired exercise performance is the hypoactive lifestyle, as often observed in patients with CHD. This frequently results from parental or environmental overprotection. CONCLUSION: These patients should be stimulated to be physically active, unless <b>medical</b> <b>restriction</b> is imposed. Fortunately, this represents {{only a small fraction}} of the total number of congenital heart defects for which sports participation is allowed. status: publishe...|$|E

Objective: To develop an instrument for evaluation of the musculoskeletal system and identification of problems, especially those related to exercise, so that patients can be cleared to exercise with no restrictions, cleared with restrictions, or not cleared before approval from a specialist. Methods: Construction and validation (according to Cronbach’s alpha) of a musculoskeletal system assessment inventory (MSSAI), for subsequent administration to participants in CPMR programs. Results: A total of 103 individuals participating in CPMR programs were evaluated {{by means of the}} MSSAI, whose internal validity and reliability proved to be satisfactory.

40|$|The {{majority}} of women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses in this study work in generalist community health centres. They have developed their praxis within the philosophy and policies of the broader women 2 ̆ 7 s health movement and primary health care principles in Australia. The fundamental assumption underlying {{this study is that}} women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses possess a unique body of knowledge and clinical wisdom that has not been previously documented and explored. The epistemological base from which these nurses 2 ̆ 7 operate offers important insights into the substantive issues that create and continually shape the practice world of nurses and their clients. Whether this represents a (re) construction of the dominant forms of health care service delivery for women is examined in this study. The study specifically aims at exploring the practice issues and experience of women 2 ̆ 7 s health service provision by women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses {{in the context of the}} provision of cervical cancer screening services. In mapping this particular group of nurses practice, it sets out to examine the professional and theoretical issues in contemporary nursing and women 2 ̆ 7 s health care. In critically analysing the powerful discourses that shape and reshape nursing work, the study raises the concern that previous analyses of pursing work tend to universalise the structural and social subordination of nurses and nursing knowledge. This universalism is most often based on examples of midwifery and nursing work in hospital settings, and subsequently, because of these conceptualisations, all of nursing is too often deemed as a dependent occupation, with little agency, and is analysed as always in relation to medicine, to hospitals, to other knowledge forms. Denoting certain discourses as dominant proposes a relationship of power and knowledge and the thesis argues that all work relations and practices in health are structured by certain power/knowledge relations. This analysis reveals that there IX are many competing and complimentary power/knowledge relations that structure nursing, but that nursing, and in particular women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses, also challenge the power/knowledge relations around them. Through examining theories of power and knowledge the analysis, argues that theoretical eclecticism is necessary to address the complex and varied nature of nursing work. In particular it identifies that postmodern and radical feminist theorising provide the most appropriate framework to further analyse and interpret the work of women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses. Fundamental to the position argued in this thesis is a feminist perspective. This position creates important theoretical and methodological links throughout the whole study. Feminist methodology was employed to guide the design, the collection and the analysis. Intrinsic to this process was the use of the 2 ̆ 7 voices 2 ̆ 7 of women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses as the basis for theorising. The 2 ̆ 7 voices 2 ̆ 7 of these nurses are highlighted in the chapters as italicised bold script. A constant companion along the way in examining women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses 2 ̆ 7 work, was the reflexivity with feminist research processes, the theoretical discussions and their 2 ̆ 7 voices 2 ̆ 7. Capturing and analysing descriptive accounts of nursing praxis is seen in this thesis as providing a way to theorise about nursing work. This methodology is able to demonstrate the knowledge forms embedded in clinical nursing praxis. Three conceptual threads emerge throughout the discussions: one focuses on nursing praxis as a distinct process, with its own distinct epistemological base rather than in relation to 2 ̆ 7 other 2 ̆ 7 knowledge forms; another describes the <b>medical</b> <b>restriction</b> and opposition as experienced by this group of nurses, but also of their resistance to medical opposition. The third theme apparent from the interviews, and which was conceptualised as beyond resistance, was the description of the alternative discourses evident in nursing work, and this focused on notions of being a professional and on autonomous nursing praxis. This study concludes that rather than accepting the totalising discourses about nursing there are examples within nursing of resistance—both ideologically and X in practice—to these dominant discourses. Women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses represent an important model of women 2 ̆ 7 s health service delivery, an analysis of which can contribute to critically reflecting on the 2 ̆ 7 paradigm of oppression 2 ̆ 7 cited in nursing and about nursing more generally. Reflecting on women 2 ̆ 7 s health service delivery also has relevance in today 2 ̆ 7 s policy environment, where structural shifts in Commonwealth/State funding arrangements in community based care, may undermine women 2 ̆ 7 s health programs. In summary this study identifies three important propositions for nursing: • nursing praxis can reconstruct traditional models of health care; • nursing praxis is powerful and able to 2 ̆ 7 resist 2 ̆ 7 dominant discourses; and • nursing praxis can be transformative. Joining feminist perspectives and alternative analyses of power provides a pluralistic and emancipatory politics for viewing, describing and analysing 2 ̆ 7 other 2 ̆ 7 nursing work. At the micro sites of power and knowledge relations—in the everyday practice worlds of nurses, of negotiation and renegotiation, of work on the margins and at the centre—women 2 ̆ 7 s health nurses 2 ̆ 7 praxis operates as a positive, productive and reconstructive force in health care...|$|E

40|$|This {{symposium}} essay {{disputes the}} conventional wisdom that “special treatment” mandates are exceptional within employment discrimination jurisprudence. To the contrary, they are endemic, and necessarily so. This is true even within disparate treatment jurisprudence. The reasons are twofold. First, remedying discrimination necessarily involves treating its victims differently than nonvictims. Employers are required to, and sometimes do, provide such remedies prior to judicial intervention. When such employer action elicits accusations of “special treatment,” these often reflect a failure or refusal to recognize that subjection to discrimination, not protected status, is the basis for the employer’s decisions. Second, distinguishing victims from nonvictims often requires making distinctions based on race or other protected status. Therefore, remedying discrimination, including disparate treatment, may require treating individuals “specially” according to race. Having identified these dynamics in disparate treatment jurisprudence, the essay then traces their replication or extension in reasonable accommodation and disparate impact liability. The more familiar “special treatment” arising out of these claims establishes their kinship with, not divergence from, disparate treatment liability. Accommodation of pregnancy-related <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> provides one example...|$|R

The diver is free to move in an air-filled dome replenished by continuous air flow from a scuba tank which {{is an integral part}} of the device. Calculations show that the equilibrium concentration of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the dome depend on the volumetric air flow from the compressed air cylinder. Experiments carried out with an air flow of 20 L/min gave gas mixtures consistent with the calculations. This provides the basis of safe design for the air supply to the dome. The medical issues that may arise in the use of the Scubadoo device are discussed.

Abstract : The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{contribution}} of caffeine intake, through the chewing gum, in the aerobic and anaerobic performance in actives militaries. In this study participated twenty militaries from the Brazilian Navy, students of Escola de Aprendizes-Marinheiros de Santa Catarina, male, physically active, no <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> for physical activity and practitioners of military physical training. The sixteen subjects performed a randomized double-blind trial design, in which they performed on the same day the TCar test and a test of RSA, with five minutes interval between them. After 48 h these tests were repeated. Subjects consumed each day, five minutes before the TCar test, chewing gum containing caffeine (240 mg or 3 mg. kg- 1 body weight) or placebo. For repeated measurements to assess the effects of caffeine on the performance of the RSA one two-way ANOVA analysis (subjects versus time sprints) with repeated measures, on both factors was used to assess the effects of caffeine in the performance of the RSA. For post hoc analysis the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons was used.

Based on the intervention-specific characteristics, a randomized control trial or a quasi-experiment with match-criteria will be conducted. Notwithstanding the study design, eligible participants will be employees aged 18 to 63, working at least 12 h per week, and at risk of work disability, or already work-disabled due to <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The primary outcome will be the duration of sick leave. Secondary outcomes are health status and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and then 6, 12 and 18 months later. Economic costs will consist of healthcare costs and cost of lost production due to work disability, and will be evaluated from a societal perspective. Discussion The CASE-study {{is the first to}} conduct economic evaluations of multiple different employability interventions based on a similar methodological framework. The cost-effectiveness results for every employability intervention will be published in 2014, but the methods, strengths and weaknesses of the study protocol are discussed in this paper. To contribute to treatment options in occupational health practice and enable the development of guidelines on how to conduct economic evaluation better suited to this field; this paper provides an important first step. Trial registration Four trials involved in the CASE-study are registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry: Care for Work (NTR 2886), Health and Motion (NTR 3111), Guidance to Excel in Return to Work (NTR 3151), Care for Companies/Second Care (NTR 3136). </p...|$|R
40|$|Employers and {{employees}} alike benefit when injured employees quickly {{return to work}} following a work-related injury. Often, this requires employers to modify current work assignments or to create alternate assignments that accommodate an employee’s <b>medical</b> <b>restrictions</b> while the employee heals. The alternative assignments—or “light-duty” work—can take many forms. For example, clerical duties, secretarial responsibilities, and other alternative positions can be implemented into the company’s return-to-work policy. Unfortunately, however, not all employers can accommodate injured employees. In such situations, an injured employee may sit idly at home while the employer pays his or her workers’ compensation benefits. A number of industries are prevented from enjoying the myriad benefits associated with Early-Return-to-Work (ERTW) programs. To help these industries realize those benefits, an innovative, new disability management tool has gained interest throughout the country—a Modified Duty Off-Site (MDOS) program. Through MDOS programs, an employer can direct injured employees to a local charity or nonprofit organization for light-duty work while the employees recover. Although a handful of businesses in Nebraska have implemented the program, Nebraska law is silent as to whether its Workers’ Compensation Act permits MDOS programs. Neither Nebraska’s revised statutes nor the Nebraska courts confirm the permissibility of MDOS programs. Moreover, the compensation court’s historically liberal protection of employees {{could result in the}} court finding MDOS programs are more harmful to the interests of employees than beneficial. Consequently, this Comment has a dual purpose. First, it advocates for legislative action. The Nebraska legislature must amend its workers’ compensation statutes so that employers can confidently implement MDOS programs as part of their broader return-to-work policies. Second, even if such legislative action is not taken, the Comment demonstrates how Nebraska law still permits MDOS programs. Part II discusses ERTW programs, the supporting law for such programs, and the status of the law regarding MDOS programs nationally. Part III analyzes the status of the law in Nebraska concerning MDOS programs and—due to the absence of any clear direction—advocates for legislative action. Part IV argues that Nebraska courts should nonetheless support MDOS programs even if legislative action is not taken because Nebraska law inferentially supports the practice...|$|R
