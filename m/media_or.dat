5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigation is}} {{not restricted to}} retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used.

5|$|Several German art groups {{formed in}} the 20th century, such as the November Group or Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), by the Russian-born Wassily Kandinsky, {{influenced}} the development of Expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose as a counter-style to it during the Weimar Republic. Post-World War II art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into Neo-expressionism, performance art and Conceptualism. Especially notable neo-expressionists include Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, Jörg Immendorff, A. R. Penck, Markus Lüpertz, Peter Robert Keil and Rainer Fetting. Other notable artists who work with traditional <b>media</b> <b>or</b> figurative imagery include Martin Kippenberger, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Neo Rauch. Leading German conceptual artists include or included Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Hans Haacke, Joseph Beuys, HA Schult, Aris Kalaizis, Neo Rauch (New Leipzig School) and Andreas Gursky (photography). Major art exhibitions and festivals in Germany are the documenta, the Berlin Biennale, transmediale and Art Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} and personalities {{featured in the}} game directly correspond to real life venues and people—for example, blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned {{as one of the}} Hatoful world's most influential writers, and the aforementioned Torimi Café, featured in-game as a location where the protagonist can work during summer vacation, is an actual bird-themed café located in Kobe. Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, <b>media,</b> <b>or</b> people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades—the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe—was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments, the Plank of Carneades.|$|E

5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking to reporters without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to the <b>media</b> <b>or</b> attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E
