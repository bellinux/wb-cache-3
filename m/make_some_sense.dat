Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing.

The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

2500|$|Gale Edwards' 1995 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Josie Lawrence and Michael Siberry. Edwards {{was the first woman}} to direct the play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and for this reason alone, it received a great deal of attention. The play opens on a stormy night, with a woman (played by Lawrence) dressed in rags trying to get her drunk husband (played by Siberry) to come home. He refuses, and falls asleep outside the tavern. As with the Bogdanov production, the taming story was then presented as Sly's dream. However, in Edwards, it was set in a surreal landscape, with the characters sporting a bizarre mixture of costumes; Elizabethan, commedia dell'arte, pantomime, Victorian, Edwardian, and modern dress. At the end of Katherina's speech (which was delivered lovingly until she realised she was part of a wager, at which point she began to speak angrily, and by the end, Petruchio had become bowed with shame), the text was cut and at this point, the play returned to the Induction setting. Sly, having been deeply moved by his dream, condemns the subjugation of women and embraces his wife, whose love he now appreciates {{for the first time in}} his life. The production notes say of Katherina's speech; [...] "Petruchio slowly realises what he has been attempting to do to Katherina in the name of love. By the end of the speech, his dream has become his nightmare." [...] Speaking of the correlation between Sly and Petruchio, Siberry stated that Petruchio becomes [...] "sobered and then shamed" [...] during the speech, whilst Sly releases [...] "that his behavior has become unacceptable." [...] As the play ends with a kneeling Sly embracing his standing wife, Siberry argues that Sly [...] "is trying to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> of what had happened, understanding that he has made an awful mistake and trying to come to terms with it." [...] The production ended ambiguously, however, with no indication as to whether Sly's wife would forgive him.|$|E

30|$|This {{interpretation}} {{is consistent with}} research demonstrating clinical dissociations between these tasks, such as that impaired face recognition does not necessarily converge with impaired face detection. For example, whilst some prosopagnosic observers exhibit impairment in both face detection and face identification, others perform poorly on identity processing tasks but comparably to controls on detection tasks (Dalrymple & Duchaine, 2016), thereby indicating that these constitute independent abilities. This <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> when considering that face detection depends {{on the ability to}} make between-category discriminations, in order to reliably distinguish a face from other objects. By contrast, face identification depends on within-category discrimination, given that all faces share a common template, but are nonetheless unique in terms of identity. In line with this reasoning, it has also been argued that face detection should, in fact, be dissociated from identification, on the basis that a good face detector should constitute a poor face identifier (Tsao & Livingstone, 2008).|$|R

Here, a change in the acceptable error rate from 0.1 to 0.5 hardly alters the assignment of characters to keys (only the “m” and “p” characters switch positions), which <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> because different key positions are nearly equivalent due to the way the cursor focuses in on a target key. For example, with a binary cursor path, 20 of the 64 keys are reached with nine cursor steps, while an additional 30 keys are reached with eight or ten cursor steps. With such homogeneity, changing the key assignments for a binary cursor path often has very little impact on the average entry time. In a similar way, key assignments have only a modest effect on the error entry rate. Thus, the main variable controlling speed and accuracy for a binary cursor path is the cursor duration, which is longer for smaller acceptable error rates.|$|R
