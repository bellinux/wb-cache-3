25|$|Forgiveness {{studies have}} been refuted by critics who claim {{that there is no}} direct {{correlation}} between forgiveness and physical health. Forgiveness, due to the reduction of directed anger, contributes to mental health and mental health contributes to physical health, but {{there is no evidence that}} forgiveness directly improves physical health. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an independent variable in an individual's well-being, so it is difficult to prove causation.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the use of}} phylogenetic analyses, Coeluridae and Coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets {{used for}} small theropods that {{did not belong to}} other groups; thus, they {{accumulated}} many dubious genera. As late as the 1980s, popular books recognized over a dozen [...] "coelurids", including such disparate forms as the noasaurid Laevisuchus and the oviraptorosaurian Microvenator, and considered them descendants of the coelophysids. A wastebasket Coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources (and appears in at least one 2006 source) but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form. Coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015, when it was defined as all species more closely related to Coelurus fragilis than to Proceratosaurus bradleyi, Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis, Compsognathus longipes, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, or Deinonychus antirrhopus by Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus. It remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than Coelurus itself, and while Tanycolagreus is often included, support for this relationship has been weak in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> that recovered it.|$|E

2500|$|Since <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> {{linking the}} Navy’s actions {{to the decline}} of public health were done by {{researchers}} affiliated with the Puerto Rico Independence Party, Pirie claimed that “none of the health-related allegations made have stood-up to credible scientific scrutiny or universally accepted legal standards”. Pirie also cited the National Cancer Institute, which said that cancer rates in many major U.S. cities are actually higher than the cancer rates in Vieques. According to Dr. Carmen Feliciano, figures drawn from her data about an increased infant mortality rate in Vieques are misleading. [...] The group that used her information omitted a range of data. [...] When that data was factored in the infant mortality rate was actually lower than that {{in the rest of}} Puerto Rico. [...] On behalf of the Navy, Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health conducted a $46,000 review of the study on vibroacoustic disease done by the Vieques government.

30|$|The {{literature}} review shows that much {{research has been}} done in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> HPPS.

While Guimaraes (2013) ignores demand uncertainty, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> HPPS assume certain demand at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> a planning interval and uncertain demand in later periods (e.g., Stadtler 1988; Vogel et al. 2017).

However, <b>the</b> HPPS <b>of</b> Fransoo (1993) can only be applied to planning problems with stationary demands and assumes lost sales.

Furthermore, Seipl (2009) assumes that non-fulfilled demand from the past is backordered and must be fulfilled with the next goods receipt, prior to current period demands.
