Extra timbering was needed and the men risked their lives as they wedged the props under the cracking beams, while now and then they worked for a shift with buckets to help the clanging pump. Their clothes were always wet, and they were generally smeared with mud when they came up to eat and sleep. The miners grumbled, and Scott and Thirlwell felt the mental and physical strain. They were highly strung and often irritable, while when they sat by the stove when work was over they only talked about the difficulties they had struggled with all day and others that must be met in the morning.|$|E

The NCB {{designed a}} model colliery, with all old working demolished and new surface buildings designed with state-of-the-art facilities, with appliances installed to reduce smoke and fumes. Coal production started in 1952, and by 1954, 200 men worked the surface and 820 men underground. New landings were made in both shafts at 280yds and 380yds, in order to work the mine by a system known as [...] "Horizon Mining" [...] employed in an effort to mine coal despite the sites geological problems.

30|$|Alona kaingang sp. nov. is {{a member}} of the pulchella-group because its posteroventral corner of the {{carapace}} is armed with many short and thin spinules not arranged in groups, three <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, marginal denticles of postabdomen merged and developed, lateral fascicles developed, IDL with three setae, seven setae on the exopodite of limb III, fourth setae of limb III well-developed, gnathobase of limb V reduced, and limb VI absent. Alona kaingang sp. nov. also has the fourth seta on the exopodite of limb III geniculated, like many species of the pulchella-group (except in Alona archeri). As an alternative to identification, the pulchella-group may be separated into two groups based on the morphology of the <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores: one group contains species with interrupted connection (including those species with <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pore isolated) and the other contains species with complete connection. Thus, A. kaingang sp. nov., having a complete connection between the <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, could be differentiated from species belonging to do the first group: Alona capensis (Rüher, 1914), Alona setulosa (Megard, 1967), Alona cambouei (Guerne & Richard, 1893), Alona aguascalientensis Sinev & Silva-Briano, 2013, Alona nigra Smirnov, 1996, Alona setuloides Smirnov & Timms, 1983, Alona azorica Frenzel & Alonso 1989, Alona anastasia Sinev Alonso, Miracle & Suhaquillo, 2012, and Alona nuragica Margaritora, 1971. Regarding species with complete connection between <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, A. kaingang sp. nov. is distinguished by the presence of spinules on apical setae of antenna and proximal spines on IDL setae. Besides, A. kaingang sp. nov. has single morphological traits such as the slight depression in the middle portion of the exopodite of the limb V.|$|R
