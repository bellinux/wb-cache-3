5|$|Exhaust gas {{temperature}} margin erodes with usage, {{one or two}} performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin; after that, the life limited parts <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced,</b> after 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the axial compressor and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56 : the whole engine parts cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} {{reproduced}} with each replacement.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by other power sources. Transmission {{networks}} presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but {{the variability of}} intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced,</b> and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|When sieved {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the intestinal tract. Their intestinal tract is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and water can be absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the salt content of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the salt content of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a lot of water which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|E

30|$|In Illinois, {{in order}} to have the legal rights to {{longwall}} mine, a company must have the right to mine coal, as well as the right to subside the surface, which is typically part of the coal severance deed.

30|$|Some plasmas produce intense self-illumination {{that can}} cause {{problems}} by overriding and washing out a schlieren image. A narrow opaque slit mask in the knife-edge plane can eliminate much of this stray light that is off-axis. Otherwise, {{the combination of a}} monochromatic light source and a corresponding bandpass filter BF ahead of the camera is often used in plasma studies to limit the effect of self-luminosity. Some LEDs have the advantage for this purpose of being monochromatic but not spatially coherent, as are lasers. When a laser is the schlieren light source, the usual razor-blade knife-edge cutoff cannot <b>be</b> used, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>replace</b> by a graded filter (Ref. [16] Ch. 5).|$|R
