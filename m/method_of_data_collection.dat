The superscript indices in the existing scheme (e.g. Re 4/4IV, V, VI…) presented a particular problem for this draft new system's planned <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> By 1988, the drafting process had led to a first draft of a UIC compliant numbering scheme, which, however, never came fully into operation. [...] At that time, the plan was that the first digit of a vehicle's number would denote the number of drive axles, and the second digit would correspond with the superscript used for that vehicle's series under the original system (e.g. Re 4/4II would become Re 420). [...] For locomotives with carrying axles, the oblique stroke included in the old name would be replaced by the digit 9 (e.g. Ae 4/7 would become Ae 497).|$|E
2500|$|Statistics on the {{reliability}} of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Edzard Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, {{but none of the}} cases had been reported. He concluded that under-reporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates [...] "nonsensical." [...] He therefore suggested that [...] "clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element." [...] The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection. Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E

Has less experimental control(n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Data collected is usually difficult to analyze; as the discussion must be audio or video taped, field notes to be recorded and the verbatim to be transcribed (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library & Savithiri, 2009).Requires or the need for carefully trained interviewers(n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Groups may vary considerably. Groups may be difficult to assemble (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Discussion must be conducted in an environment that is conducive to conversation (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). There is high potential for leading and bias (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). Moderator or rather the facilitation of the discussion may be critical as the group largely banks on the assisted discussion in order to produce results(Savithiri, 2009).The need for skilled and trained moderators or interviewers is necessary (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).There is a high chance or risk for the moderator to dominate or ‘hijack’ the discussion(Savithiri, 2009). There may be difficulties in terms of the sample study results representing the population as participants are self-selected; hence generalization becomes difficult or impossible(Savithiri, 2009).The moderator may influence the group interactions thus distorting results or findings (Morgan). Participant’s involvement and contribution in the discussion also plays a major role(Morgan).Issues may arise if topics are controversial in nature leading to disagreements and arguments(Morgan).Results obtained may be biased as one or two prevalent people may influence the interaction or discussion(n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages).Dealing with sensitive topics is a challenge(n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages).Contrived or artificial environment also may influence the interactions and responses, thus leading to biased results (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages).Ethical issues may rise regarding confidentiality aspect (Deem, 1997).

40|$|Introduction: This article {{describes}} different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> using consumer quality index (CQI) surveys. The response and representativeness of respondents are also examined. Method: From publications of CQI measurements, the following aspects were reported: <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>method(s),</b> number <b>of</b> reminders, {{number of questions}} in the survey, response, comparison of respondents and the sample for age and gender. Using correlational analyses we also studied how the response was related to various other features of CQI measurements. Results: For the majority of CQI surveys, questionnaires were distributed by mail (22). Occasionally, data were collected by interviews (2), the Internet (1) {{or a combination of}} internet and mail <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> (3). The response was the highest with interviews and the lowest for the Internet. The response did not correlate with the number of questions in the questionnaire. Men were more likely to respond to an Internet questionnaire compared to women and men were generally underrepresented in <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> through mail. Conclusion: CQI questionnaires were mainly distributed by mail. The response varied within and between <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> A combination <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> may improve the response.

50|$|There are two {{different}} purposes of BWS - as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection,</b> and/or as a theory of how people make choices when confronted with three or more items.

As Marley and Louviere note, maxdiff is a long-established academic mathematical theory with very specific assumptions about how people make choices: it assumes that respondents evaluate all possible pairs of items within the displayed set and choose the pair that reflects the maximum difference in preference or importance.|$|E

40|$|In {{the project}} "Local and National Public Health Monitor" {{national}} reference data are generated by merging regional data, that are {{collected by the}} Community Health Services. The aim of this report is to investigate whether differences in the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> threaten the comparability <b>of</b> regional <b>data</b> and the merging <b>of</b> regional <b>data</b> into national reference <b>data.</b> The effect <b>of</b> differences in the sampling methods, non-response, seasonal variation, and mode <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> on outcome measures is investigated by literature review, data analyses, and consulting experts. Differences in the size or fraction of the sample will not influence the comparability <b>of</b> collected <b>data.</b> When a stratified sample is drawn, weights can be assigned to the respondents {{in order to achieve}} representativeness of the population. Bias of outcome measures caused by non-response can be largely adjusted for by weighting the data using a model consisting of variables like age, sex, or marital status.

Both seasonal variation and the mode <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> (mailed questionnaire/interview/internet) appeared to influence health indicators and life style factors.
