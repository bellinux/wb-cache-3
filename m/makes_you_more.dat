500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– rating. Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "John Doe" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season nine {{and called it}} [...] "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former [...] "writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power" [...] and the latter's acting was [...] "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on The X-Files after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it [...] "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." [...] She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on [...] "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was [...] "part of the X-Files, more so than would an alien or a mutant" [...] because it focused {{on the idea that}} [...] "pain <b>makes</b> <b>you,</b> <b>more</b> pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling [...] "John Doe" [...] a [...] "stylishly produced entry".|$|E
2500|$|Mooney captained IrelandA {{during the}} 2008 European Cricket Championship; the {{team won the}} {{competition}} and Mooney was named player of the tournament. Ireland participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, hosted by England in July; the team progressed to the second round after beating Bangladesh. Ireland's coach, Phil Simmons, identified Mooney as the team's stand-out player of the tournament. Over {{the course of the}} 2009 season, Mooney concentrated on his batting, later saying that he felt [...] "bowling medium pace <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> or less cannon fodder for the real top class player". In the 2009/10 season, Mooney travelled to Australia to play club cricket. His intention was to play a longer format of the game, in which his side batted for 92overs, with the aim of gaining selection in Ireland's first-class side. He also stated that he wanted the opportunity to bowl long spells while in Australia in an effort to revive his form.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile {{our first}} enigmatic set of Markgraves, or Deputy-Markgraves, at Brandenburg, are {{likewise}} faring ill. Whoever these valiant steel-gray gentlemen might be (which Dryasdust does {{not the least}} know, and only <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> uncertain the more he pretends to tell), one thing is very evident, they had no peaceable possession of the place, nor for above a hundred years, a constant one on any terms. The Wends were highly disinclined to conversion and obedience: once and again, and still again, they burst up; got temporary hold of Brandenburg, hoping to keep it; and did frightful heterodoxies there. So that to our distressed imagination those poor [...] "Markgraves of Witekind descent," [...] our first set in Brandenburg, become altogether shadowy, intermittent, enigmatic, painfully actual as they once were. Take one instance, omitting others; which happily proves to be the finish of that first shadowy line, and introduces us to a new set very slightly more substantial.|$|E

Assure yourselves, that the names of two such men will bear a great load of prejudice in the other scale before they can be entirely outweighed.|$|E
6000|$|Presumptuous bard! {{how could}} you dare A woman with a cloud compare? Strange pride and {{insolence}} you show Inferior mortals there below. And is our thunder in your ears So frequent or so loud as theirs? Alas! our thunder soon goes out; And only <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> devout. Then is not female clatter worse, That drives you not to pray, but curse? [...] We hardly thunder thrice a-year; The bolt discharged, the sky grows clear; But every sublunary dowdy, The more she scolds, the more she's cloudy. [How useful were a woman's thunder, If she, like us, would burst asunder! Yet, though her stays hath often cursed her, And, whisp'ring, wish'd the devil burst her: For hourly thund'ring in his face, She ne'er was known to burst a lace.] [...] Some critic may object, perhaps, That clouds are blamed for giving claps; But what, alas! are claps ethereal, Compared for mischief to venereal? Can clouds give buboes, ulcers, blotches, Or from your noses dig out notches? We leave the body sweet and sound; We kill, 'tis true, but never wound. [...] You know a cloudy sky bespeaks Fair weather when the morning breaks; But women in a cloudy plight, Foretell a storm to last till night. [...] A cloud in proper season pours His blessings down in fruitful showers; But woman was by fate design'd To pour down curses on mankind. [...] When Sirius[2] o'er the welkin rages, Our kindly help his fire assuages; But woman is a cursed inflamer, No parish ducking-stool can tame her: To kindle strife, dame Nature taught her; Like fireworks, she can burn in water. [...] For fickleness how durst you blame us, Who for our constancy are famous? You'll see a cloud in gentle weather Keep the same face an hour together; While women, {{if it could be}} reckon'd, Change every feature every second. [...] Observe our figure in a morning, Of foul or fair we give you warning; But can you guess from women's air One minute, whether foul or fair? [...] Go read in ancient books enroll'd What honours we possess'd of old. [...] To disappoint Ixion's[3] rape Jove dress'd a cloud in Juno's shape; Which when he had enjoy'd, he swore, No goddess could have pleased him more; No difference could he find between His cloud and Jove's imperial queen; His cloud produced a race of Centaurs, Famed for a thousand bold adventures; From us descended ab origine, By learned authors, called nubigenae; But say, what earthly nymph do you know, So beautiful to pass for Juno? [...] Before Æneas durst aspire To court her majesty of Tyre, His mother begg'd of us to dress him, That Dido might the more caress him: A coat we gave him, dyed in grain, A flaxen wig, and clouded cane, (The wig was powder'd round with sleet, Which fell in clouds beneath his feet) With which he made a tearing show; And Dido quickly smoked the beau. [...] Among your females make inquiries, What nymph on earth so fair as Iris? With heavenly beauty so endow'd? And yet her father is a cloud. We dress'd her in a gold brocade, Befitting Juno's favourite maid. [...] 'Tis known that Socrates the wise Adored us clouds as deities: To us he made his daily prayers, As Aristophanes declares; From Jupiter took all dominion, And died defending his opinion. By his authority 'tis plain You worship other gods in vain; And from your own experience know We govern all things there below. You follow where we please to guide; O'er all your passions we preside, Can raise them up, or sink them down, As we think fit to smile or frown: And, just as we dispose your brain, Are witty, dull, rejoice, complain. [...] Compare us then to female race! We, to whom all the gods give place! Who better challenge your allegiance Because we dwell in higher regions. You find the gods in Homer dwell In seas and streams, or low as Hell: Ev'n Jove, and Mercury his pimp, No higher climb than mount Olymp. Who makes you think the clouds he pierces? He pierce the clouds! he kiss their a--es; While we, o'er Teneriffa placed, Are loftier by a mile at least: And, when Apollo struts on Pindus, We see him from our kitchen windows; Or, to Parnassus looking down, Can piss upon his laurel crown. [...] Fate never form'd the gods to fly; In vehicles they mount the sky: When Jove would some fair nymph inveigle, He comes full gallop on his eagle; Though Venus be as light as air, She must have doves to draw her chair; Apollo stirs not out of door, Without his lacquer'd coach and four; And jealous Juno, ever snarling, Is drawn by peacocks in her berlin: But we can fly where'er we please, O'er cities, rivers, hills, and seas: From east to west the world we roam, And in all climates are at home; With care provide you as we go With sunshine, rain, and hail, or snow. You, when it rains, like fools, believe Jove pisses on you through a sieve: An idle tale, 'tis no such matter; We only dip a sponge in water, Then squeeze it close between our thumbs, And shake it well, and down it comes; As you shall to your sorrow know; We'll watch your steps where'er you go; And, since we find you walk a-foot, We'll soundly souse your frieze surtout. [...] 'Tis but by our peculiar grace, That Phoebus ever shows his face; For, when we please, we open wide Our curtains blue from side to side; And then how saucily he shows His brazen face and fiery nose; And gives himself a haughty air, As if he made the weather fair! 'Tis sung, wherever Celia treads, The violets ope their purple heads; The roses blow, the cowslip springs; 'Tis sung; but we know better things. 'Tis true, a woman on her mettle Will often piss upon a nettle; But though we own she makes it wetter, The nettle never thrives the better; While we, by soft prolific showers, Can every spring produce you flowers. [...] Your poets, Chloe's beauty height'ning, Compare her radiant eyes to lightning; And yet I hope 'twill be allow'd, That lightning comes but from a cloud. [...] But gods like us have too much sense At poets' flights to take offence; Nor can hyperboles demean us; Each drab has been compared to Venus. We own your verses are melodious; But such comparisons are odious. [Observe the case--I state it thus: Though you compare your trull to us, But think how damnably you err When you compare us clouds to her; From whence you draw such bold conclusions; But poets love profuse allusions. And, if you now so little spare us, Who knows how soon you may compare us To Chartres, Walpole, or a king, If once we let you have your swing. Such wicked insolence appears Offensive to all pious ears. To flatter women by a metaphor! What profit could you hope to get of her? And, for her sake, turn base detractor Against your greatest benefactor. [...] But we shall keep revenge in store If ever you provoke us more: For, since we know you walk a-foot, We'll soundly drench your frieze surtout; Or may we never thunder throw, Nor souse to death a birth-day beau. [...] We own your verses are melodious; But such comparisons are odious.] ...|$|E
