5|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, <b>molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E
5|$|The rise of <b>molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{prompted}} new evolutionary hypotheses {{that were}} different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results of molecular studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences.|$|E

25|$|Crop {{alteration}} {{has been}} practiced by humankind {{for thousands of}} years, {{since the beginning of}} civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and <b>molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> that genetically modify the organism.|$|E
25|$|The {{new tools}} of molecular-biology changed {{the study of}} bird systematics. Systematics changed from being based on {{phenotype}} to the underlying genotype. The use of techniques such as DNA-DNA hybridization to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist resulting in {{what is called the}} Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and molecular phylogenetics approaches that make use of computational procedures for sequence alignment, construction of phylogenetic trees and calibration of molecular clocks to infer evolutionary relationships. <b>Molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> are also widely used in studies of avian population biology and ecology.|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known.

Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by <b>molecular</b> <b>techniques</b> (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection.
