5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The <b>Mary</b> <b>Tyler</b> Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E
