40|$|Legendary <b>Metal</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Early English Literature' is a {{study of}} Christian {{religious}} influence on the portrayal of a powerful technology, metallurgy, in Old English verse. Starting from {{the controversy over the}} supernatural role of <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> in a metrical Anglo-Saxon charm, it proceeds to explore the impact of Christian thought on attitudes to the metal-worker in late antiquity and early medieval Europe. Significant and contentious characterizations of the smith in the Cain legend, the lives of the saints, and legends of Christ are discussed in turn. A chapter on heroic verse and another on wonder-working discuss, among other topics, the theory that Anglo-Saxon <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> were regarded with fear and superstition. The thesis put forth by the author {{in the course of this}} survey is that the critical approach which explains the concern of Anglo-Saxon literature with smithcraft as little more than an irrational primitivism finds little support in the religious writing of the period. What requires explanation is not the view that metallurgy was a matter of Christian concern, but the assumption that it was not. While this study is primarily concerned with mapping literary themes, it is not confined to the world of the imagination. Holding that themes, in order to be appreciated, must be perceived, where possible, in the light of the historical conditions in which they flourished, it devotes part of its space to a consideration of the latter. It examines the role of the monastic movement in disseminating an idealistic view of industry; describes the achievements of Anglo-Saxon metal-working; and attempts to appreciate some of the real hardships faced by workers in the Anglo-Saxon forge. The insights gained from this approach lead ultimately to a new reading of the metrical Anglo-Saxon charm with which the study began, a reading which, rather than peering backwards into the pagan past, looks forward to subsequent and more familiar examples of the forge in literature...|$|R

50|$|For silicon, gauge {{factors can}} be two orders of {{magnitudes}} {{larger than those}} observed in most <b>metals</b> (<b>Smith</b> 1954). The resistance of n-conducting silicon mainly changes due to a shift of the three different conducting valley pairs. The shifting causes a redistribution of the carriers between valleys with different mobilities. This results in varying mobilities dependent on the direction of current flow. A minor effect {{is due to the}} effective mass change related to changing shapes of the valleys. In p-conducting silicon the phenomena are more complex and also result in mass changes and hole transfer.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{formation}} of AIRLANT and the abolishment of recruit training on the surface side in 1942, the base transitioned to an advanced training location for men going directly to the fleet. With {{the change in the}} training station and the declaration of war, the mission became that of a pre-commissioning training station. The aviation service A school offered courses in <b>metal</b> <b>smith</b> work, engine repair, radio repair and ordnance. Aviation machinist's mate A school consisted of two months of training and two months of practical experience in A&R department shops. The advanced base aviation training unit helped sailors develop the skills necessary to maintain all types of aircraft at advanced bases in combat area. The aircraft they completed went to the fleet pool for distribution to squadrons in the process of commissioning. A similar service for maintenance crews in squadrons awaiting the commissioning of new carriers was provided by the carrier air service unit. Among the earliest schools at NAS was the fighter director school, which taught fleet communications and tactics, radar operations and direction of aircraft from ships before moving to Georgia. The celestial navigation training unit instructed pilots being assigned to patrol squadrons. The aerial free gunnery training unit was originally located at Breezy Point, but moved to Dam Neck in 1943 to be able to carry out range work without restricting airspace.|$|E

40|$|In this {{creative}} project I explored carving in wax {{and casting}} in the lost wax method to create rings with characteristics from ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, medieval Europe, {{as well as}} contemporary designs. It was important to my work {{for me to understand}} the history and significance of symbolic rings, and how they have changed over time in design. After studying these time periods, I made numerous sketches of the rings. These designs were finalized, carved in wax, and then cast in metal. Measurements of the metal needed to cast each ring were taken and recorded. Experimenting with various tools I achieved a method that produced quality and satisfying results in the carving of the wax. Other traditional <b>metal</b> <b>smith</b> techniques were used, such as prong settings and post settings for stones in the completion of the rings.

In the exhibition, objects will be framed exquisitely by these unusual wooden display cabinets, with the effect of encouraging original conversations between craft and design and the relationship between form and function. Specifically, Grant McCaig's metal and silver pieces will be displayed within Gates’ 'Goffman Series' echoing their delicate yet sculptural forms. Sumioka's jewellery pieces, inspired by refined and ancient Japanese architecture will be housed within the drawers of Gates 'Interlocutors', which have an explicit visual relationship to industrial and agricultural structures. Finally, Bohle's richly glazed ceramic pieces will sit within Marigold's cabinets, contrasting with their raw 'bleeding' wood exteriors, highlighting the differing outcomes of chemical reactions on natural materials...|$|E
