40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design, simulation, prototype, and {{test of a}} new energy generation system, which transforms rotational motion into electricity {{by the use of}} an innovative turbine-generator. The system is divided in two assembled subsystems that interact to finally transform kinetic energy into electricity. The first subsystem is a miniaturized notched impulse turbine system, and the second one is a millimeter permanent magnet generator (PMG) assembled into the turbine. The conversion of biomechanical energy to electric energy, using clean and free energy produced by a living organism, is being increasingly researched [1]-[11]. These are all viable options, but advantages and disadvantages of each type of energy conversions should be evaluated individually to determine key factors such as efficiency as an energy harvesting method, the implementation cost, size, and the final applications where they will be used. Through this dissertation, a new option of green energy conversion is made available; focusing on the use of turbines to extract energy from microfluidics, with diverse application in biomedical, military/aerospace, and home areas. These systems have the potential of converting mechanical movement energy, and hydraulic energy into electric energy that may be sufficient for self-powering nano/micro devices and nano/micro systems. A flow, with constant pressure, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>generator,</b> and a novel impulse turbine design are combined to form a self-contained miniaturized generator system. The turbine consists of two main parts: a bearingless rotor and the enclosure or casing; while the miniaturized <b>magnetic</b> <b>generator</b> is a permanent magnet brushless machine, consisting of permanent magnets in a ring configuration and radial coils. A permanent pressure, from microfluidic pressure system, is the force used to move the blades. This rotational motion of the turbine is transformed into electricity using magnetic induction, formed by permanent magnets on the rotor and nine coils fixed in the holder of the turbine. The electricity is generated when the magnetic field rotates and moves past the conductor, which induces a current according to Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Law [1 - 3]. The system has potential uses not only in medical equipment, but in automotive applications, home appliances, and aquatic and ventilation systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Biomechanical energy harvesting–generating {{electricity}} from people during daily activities–is a promising alternative to batteries for powering increasingly sophisticated portable devices. We recently developed a wearable knee-mounted {{energy harvesting device}} that generated electricity during human walking. In this methods-focused paper, we explain the physiological principles that guided our design process and present {{a detailed description of}} our device design with an emphasis on new analyses. Methods Effectively harvesting energy from walking requires a small lightweight device that efficiently converts intermittent, bi-directional, low speed and high torque mechanical power to electricity, and selectively engages power generation to assist muscles in performing negative mechanical work. To achieve this, our device used a one-way clutch to transmit only knee extension motions, a spur gear transmission to amplify the angular speed, a brushless DC rotary <b>magnetic</b> <b>generator</b> to convert the mechanical power into electrical power, a control system to determine when to open and close the power generation circuit based on measurements of knee angle, and a customized orthopaedic knee brace to distribute the device reaction torque over a large leg surface area. Results The device selectively engaged power generation towards the end of swing extension, assisting knee flexor muscles by producing substantial flexion torque (6. 4 Nm), and efficiently converted the input mechanical power into electricity (54. 6 %). Consequently, six subjects walking at 1. 5 m/s generated 4. 8 ± 0. 8 W of electrical power with only a 5. 0 ± 21 W increase in metabolic cost.
