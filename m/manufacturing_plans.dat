In {{addition}} to Handley-Page's own production line, the type {{was to be}} built under subcontract by English Electric at their factory in Preston, Lancashire; on 6 August 1938, English Electric was awarded an initial contract to manufacture 75 Hampdens. In addition, Canadian interest in domestic production of the type had resulted {{in the establishment of}} the joint Anglo-Canadian Canadian Associated Aircraft company, which promptly received an initial order from the RAF for 80 Hampdens to be completed in Canada; this facility would effectively act as a shadow factory during wartime. On 1 September 1938, in response to interest expressed by the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF) in the Hampden, including in a potential licence production arrangement for 70 aircraft to be built in Sweden, a single production Hampton was supplied to Sweden. Designated P.5 by the RSAF, it was operated by the service through to November 1945, after which it was sold to Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) to serve as a flying testbed before being retired in late 1947.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of engineered-to-order (ETO) environments are {{in conflict with}} the basic assumptions of <b>Manufacturing</b> Resource <b>Planning</b> (MRP) systems, which makes MRP based <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> systems fail {{to meet the needs of}} ETO companies. ETO environments are complex and require sophisticated planning techniques. In fact, the shortcomings of planning and scheduling systems are exacerbating the ability of ETO companies to reduce manufacturing cycle times. This thesis presents an overview of ETO environments and related <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling systems. The reasons for the failure of present MRP systems to address ETO environments are discussed along with an analysis of the planning systems of real companies. A new framework for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling in ETO environments is proposed. It addresses the importance of coordinating planning and scheduling among engineering, material procurement and the shop floor. It incorporates finite capacity scheduling into MRP systems to overcome load fluctuations. It also has scheduling mechanisms to address the dynamic nature of ETO environments...|$|R

50|$|The Mirage IIIV was a {{competitor}} with Hawker Siddeley's P.1154 VTOL fighter, {{a cousin of}} the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Both aircraft competed to be selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement. While the Mirage IIIV is commonly viewed as being more politically palatable due to an emphasis having been placed upon multinational development and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plans,</b> the design of P.1154 (which only used a single engine) was seen as more straightforward and practical. Ultimately the P.1154 was selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement {{to the detriment of}} the Mirage IIIV. One of the two prototypes constructed was destroyed in an accident; shortly following its loss, the whole project was abandoned; the surviving aircraft has since been placed on public display.|$|E

The decision was criticised for not awarding the contract to the Bombardier/Siemens offer which was expected to have resulted in work for Bombardier's Derby factory. The DfT was also accused of 'spin' in describing the Agility trains consortium as a 'British led consortium'. and Hitachi's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plans</b> attracted concern for reasons such as balance of payments issues, the Japanese domestic railway market being largely closed to foreign entrants, {{and the extent to which}} jobs would be safeguarded or created in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{features}} and feature-based representations {{have become an}} integral part of research on manufacturing systems, largely due to their ability to model correspondences between design information and manufacturing operations. However, several research challenges still must be addressed in order to place feature technologies into a solid scientific and mathematical framework: One challenge is the issue of alternatives in feature- based planning. Even after one has decided upon al abstract set of features to use for representing manufacturing operations, the set of feature instances used to represent a complex part is by no means unique. For a complex part, many (sometimes infinitely many) different manufacturing operations can potentially be used to manufacture various portions of the part - - and thus many different feature instances can be used to represent these portions of the part. Some of these feature instances will appear in useful <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plans,</b> and others will not. If the latter feature instances can be discarded at the outset, this will reduce the number of alternative <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plans</b> to be examined in order to find a useful one. Thus, what is required is a systematic means of specifying which feature instances are of interest. This paper addresses the issue of alternatives by introducing the notion of primary feature instances, which we contend are sufficient to generate all <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plans</b> of interest. To substantiate our argument, we describe how various instances in the primary feature set can be used to produce the desired plans. Furthermore, we discuss how this formulation overcomes computational difficulties faced by previous work, and present some complexity results for this approach in the domain of machined parts...|$|E
