In <b>multienvironment</b> trials, {{the local}} spatial {{tendency}} within trials and the residual heterogeneity between trials can be jointly modeled {{in the context}} of mixed linear models. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the suitability of spatial models within trials and the residual heterogeneity between trials for <b>multienvironment</b> fertilizer trials. The research used field trials data of rice fertilization in Karawang and Kebumen region. Fertilizer treatments consist of fourteen levels of fertilizer type with three replications. In Kebumen region the research was conducted over two growing seasons. The experiment used a randomized complete block design. The results show that for single experiment the best model for Karawang and Kebumen 1 location was RCBCE power isotropic model, whilst for Kebumen 2 location was RCBCE power anisotropic model. In combined experiments the best model was CE power anisotropic model with heterogeneous residual variance across locations. Modeling of the local spatial tendencies using an analysis of variance including heterogeneous residual variances increased the ability to identify differences among treatments.

40|$|An {{important}} assumption in {{the analysis}} of <b>multienvironment</b> cultivar trials is homogeneity of error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances. When variances are heterogeneous, the best estimators of performance are obtained by weighting inversely to variance components. However, because variances are almost never known and must be estimated, the additional error introduced into the model from estimating many variances may cause weighted estimators to perform poorly. Our objective was to test a Bayesian approach to estimating heterogeneous error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances. A Bayesian model for <b>multienvironment</b> yield trials that includes a linear model for error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances was applied to yield data from the Iowa State University Oat Variety Trial for the years 1997 to 2003.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Some {{techniques}} of multivariate statistical analysis {{can only be}} conducted on a complete data matrix, but the process of data collection often misses some elements. Imputation is a technique by which the missing elements are replaced by plausible values, so that a valid analysis can be performed on the completed data set. A multiple imputation method is proposed based on a modification to the singular value decomposition (SVD) method for single imputation, developed by Krzanowski. The method was evaluated on a genotype × environment (G × E) interaction matrix obtained from a randomized blocks experiment on Eucalyptus grandis grown in <b>multienvironments.</b> Values of E. grandis heights in the G × E complete interaction matrix were deleted randomly at three different rates (5 %, 10 %, 30 %) and were then imputed by the proposed methodology. The results were assessed {{by means of a}} general measure of performance (Tacc), and showed a small bias when compared to the original data. However, bias values were greater than the variability of imputations relative to their mean, indicating a smaller accuracy of the proposed method in relation to its precision. The proposed methodology uses the maximum amount of available information, does not have any restrictions regarding the pattern or mechanism of the missing values, and is free of assumptions on the data distribution or structure...|$|R
40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} {{food for the}} {{majority}} of Tanzanians. However, maize production in the Southern highlands of Tanzania (SHT) is highly reduced by gray leaf spot disease (GLS) caused by the fungus Cercospora zea maydis. GLS reduces grain yield, kernel and silage quality. The most common GLS control methods in Tanzania include amongst others; fungicides, crop rotation, field sanitation, host resistance. These methods except host resistance are, however, either expensive or less effective or unsafe to the environment. Furthermore, conventional breeding strategies are not very effective for traits, which are lowly inherited such as GLS resistance. Lastly, to date there are few GLS resistant commercial hybrids in SHT. Thus, this study aimed to produce more commercial GLS resistant hybrids, increase farmers’ hybrid choices of growing genetically different GLS insensitive hybrids, which will also provide a constant supply of GLS resistant maize cultivars in case of GLS resistance breakdown due to new GLS pathotypes. This research combined conventional breeding with molecular technologies to increase the efficacy of selecting GLS resistant hybrids and assist breeders in predicting best inbred combinations for commercial hybrid production. Studies conducted to meet the main aims were on; the prediction of best line combiners and heterosis in Tanzanian maize breeding lines through the use of amplified fragment length polymorphism, (AFLP), an association of AFLPs and the performance of phenotypic traits in maize, evaluation of maize hybrids for gray leaf spot resistance in <b>multienvironments</b> and finally a preliminary study on gray leaf spot PCR-based marker development with the long term objective of implementing cleaved amplified polymorphic markers (CAPS) in a marker assisted selection (MAS) strategy in the SHT maize breeding programme. Results from the study revealed that pairwise GD (genetic distance) of the lines varied from a GD of 0. 13 to 0. 5. High coancentry coefficients were exhibited by these lines. Joint data analyses showed that there were tighter associations between line GD and F 1 traits or MPH in the intergroup than in the intragroup crosses. Combined analyses revealed that hybrids 48, 90 and 45 recorded higher stable yields and consistently low GLS scores in <b>multienvironments.</b> Fifteen CAPS marker bands were identified that are putatively linked to the GLS resistant genes. In summary, it was noted that strong selection during inbreeding programs should be avoided as it reduces germplasm variability. Local landraces/varieties can be improved by introgressing desirable genes into them. AFLP marker system could be effectively used for inbred genetic diversity studies in Tanzania. Intergroup crosses with high GD-MPH should be the main target for commercial hybrid production but field testing of them is inevitable to confirm their yielding potentials. Intergroups and intragroup crosses with low GD-MPH should be discarded to avoid field costs. Better F 1 hybrid performance predictions can be achieved by integrating inbred GD and F 1 phenotypic data. Hybrids with low GLS/high GLS resistance could be used to produce other breeding populations. Hybrids 45, 48 and 90 can be commercially preleased. Lastly a study to characterize the GLS fungus in the SHT is imperative since information on virulence of isolates is needed for long term breeding strategies against the fungus. Finally, the SHT maize germplasm has potential GLS resistant inbred lines which could be used in the deployment of genes to susceptible lines and in the development of commercial GLS resistant hybrids/open pollinated varieties/doubled haploid hybrids.

40|$|Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) {{populations are}} now being {{utilized}} to more accurately identify the underlying genetic basis of quantitative traits through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses and subsequent gene discovery. The expanded genetic diversity present in such populations and the amplified number of recombination events mean that QTL can be identified at a higher resolution. Most QTL analyses are conducted separately for each trait within a single environment. Separate analysis does {{not take advantage of}} the underlying correlation structure found in <b>multienvironment</b> or multitrait data. By using this information in a joint analysis-be it <b>multienvironment</b> or multitrait - it is possible to gain a greater understanding of genotype- or QTL-by-environment interactions or of pleiotropic effects across traits. Furthermore, this can result in improvements in accuracy for a range of traits or in a specific target environment and can influence selection decisions. Data derived from MAGIC populations allow for founder probabilities of all founder alleles to be calculated for each individual within the population. This presents an additional layer of complexity and information that can be utilized to identify QTL. A whole-genome approach is proposed for <b>multienvironment</b> and multitrait QTL analysis in MAGIC. The whole-genome approach simultaneously incorporates all founder probabilities at each marker for all individuals in the analysis, rather than using a genome scan. A dimension reduction technique is implemented, which allows for high-dimensional genetic data. For each QTL identified, sizes of effects for each founder allele, the percentage of genetic variance explained, and a score to reflect the strength of the QTL are found. The approach was demonstrated to perform well in a small simulation study and for two experiments, using a wheat MAGIC population...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{patterns of}} variation in species biomass in terms of species traits and environmental variables a one-to-one approach might not be sufficient, and a multitrait <b>multienvironment</b> approach will be necessary. A multitrait <b>multienvironment</b> approach is proposed, based on a mixed model for species biomass. In the model, environmental variables are species-dependent random terms, whereas traits are fixed terms, and trait-environment relationships are fixed interaction terms. In this approach, identifying the important trait-environment relationship becomes a model selection problem. Because of the mix of fixed and random terms, we propose a novel tiered forward selection approach for this. In the first tier, the random factors are selected; in the second, the fixed effects; in the final tier, nonsignificant terms are removed using a modified Akaike information criterion. We complement this tiered selection with an alternative selection method, namely, type II maximum likelihood. A mesocosm experiment on early community assembly in wetlands with three two-level environmental factors is analyzed by the new approach. The results are compared with the fourth corner problem and the linear trait-environment method. Traits related to germination and seedling establishment are selected as being most important in the community assembly in these wetland mesocosms...|$|E
40|$|The <b>multienvironment</b> {{conditional}} probability density function (MECPDF) model was first proposed by Fox [Computational Models for Turbulent Reacting Flows (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2003) ] {{as a simple}} extension of <b>multienvironment</b> probability density function models for turbulent reacting flows. Like the conditional moment closure (CMC) and the laminar flamelet model (LFM), the MECPDF model describes the reacting scalars conditioned {{on the value of}} the mixture fraction. However, unlike CMC and LFM, the new model provides a consistent description of conditional fluctuations in both the scalar dissipation rate and the reacting scalars, and hence can be used to model partial extinction and reignition in homogeneous turbulent reacting flows. In this work, a general derivation of the MECPDF model is presented for a single reaction-progress variable using the direct quadrature method of moments. Extensions of the model to multiple reaction-progress variables and conditioning on the mixture-fraction vector are also discussed. After deriving the model, the closure assumptions are validated using direct simulations for pure diffusion of two randomly distributed, initially correlated scalar fields.

40|$|A major aim in some plant-based {{studies is}} the {{determination}} of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for multiple traits or across multiple environments. Understanding these QTL by trait or QTL by environment interactions can be of great value to the plant breeder. A whole genome approach {{for the analysis of}} QTL is presented for such multivariate applications. The approach is an extension of whole genome average interval mapping in which all intervals on a linkage map are included in the analysis simultaneously. A random effects working model is proposed for the multivariate (trait or environment) QTL effects for each interval, with a variance-covariance matrix linking the variates in a particular interval. The significance of the variance-covariance matrix for the QTL effects is tested and if significant, an outlier detection technique is used to select a putative QTL. This QTL by variate interaction is transferred to the fixed effects. The process is repeated until the variance-covariance matrix for QTL random effects is not significant; at this point all putative QTL have been selected. Unlinked markers can also be included in the analysis. A simulation study was conducted to examine the performance of the approach and demonstrated the multivariate approach results in increased power for detecting QTL in comparison to univariate methods. The approach is illustrated for data arising from experiments involving two doubled haploid populations. The first involves analysis of two wheat traits, a-amylase activity and height, while the second is concerned with a <b>multienvironment</b> trial for extensibility of flour dough.

The recombinant inbred line population expressed quantitative variation and transgressive segregation for 11 traits associated with drought tolerance. QTL were detected by both a mixed <b>multienvironment</b> model and by composite interval mapping for each environment using a linkage map constructed with 165 genetic markers that covered 11 linkage groups of the common bean genome. In the <b>multienvironment,</b> mixed model, nine QTL were detected for 10 drought stress tolerance mechanism traits found on six of the 11 linkage groups. Significant QTL × environment interaction was observed for six of the nine QTL. QTL × environment interaction was of the cross-over type for three of the six significant QTL with contrasting effect of the parental alleles across different environments. In the composite interval mapping, we found 69 QTL in total. The majority of these were found for Palmira (47) or Awassa (18), with fewer in Malawi (4). Phenotypic variation explained by QTL in single environments ranged up to 37 %, and the most consistent QTL were for Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) leaf chlorophyll reading and pod partitioning traits.

Transpiration rate was estimated daily and a mathematical curve was fitted to its response to water deficit intensity. We also determined delta C- 13 values in leaves, transpiration efficiency and water extraction capacity. These traits were then analysed in a <b>multienvironment</b> (year and water status) quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Quantitative trait loci, independent of year and water status, were detected for each trait. One genomic region was specifically implicated in the acclimation of scion transpiration induced by the rootstock. The QTLs identified colocalized with genes involved in water deficit responses, such as those relating to ABA and hydraulic regulation. Scion transpiration rate and its acclimation to water deficit are thus controlled genetically by the rootstock, through different genetic architectures...|$|E
40|$|The abruptness and {{intensity}} of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary have been deemphasized by some authors over recent years, mainly by those skeptical of an impact origin for the boundary. However, it was recognized at the birth of stratigraphy as both abrupt and of major importance. It was used to define the change from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic; the boundary has become continually more precisely defined and its global sequences more correlatable. It is now unique in being an event boundary marked by an iridium-bearing layer of global extent, rather than an arbitrary boundary in a sequence of little change. The Permian-Triassic boundary, in contrast, is arbitrary and the transition is not yet proven to be abrupt, the extinctions that define it perhaps having taken place in pulses over several millions of years. Some {{of those who have}} denied the importance (and in some cases even the existence) of an impact in the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions have placed burdens of proof on the impact hypothesis that they do not place on strictly terrestrial mechanisms. Terrestrial mechanisms have always been unsatisfactory (or at least unconvincing for global, massive, <b>multienvironment</b> faunal change) and are now even more so. Some authors have required of the impact hypothesis attributes that are not inherent in it, including particular patterns of extinction selectivity and timing...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} grain number {{determination}} in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] was studied based on canopy growth traits. Traits were crop growth rate (CGR) around flowering, plant reproductive biomass partitioning (P) to the panicle, and grain-set efficiency (E) {{per unit of}} accumulated panicle biomass. Previous evidence has shown that these traits vary across commercial germplasm and that P and E are genotype-specific traits with low environmental effects. Our hypothesis was that P and E are highly heritable traits correlated to grain number (and yield) for which environmentally consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) could be detected. Studied recombinant inbred lines (RILs) showed important variation in yield, grain number per square meter, time to anthesis, plant height, CGR, P and E, and growth environments created significant genotype × environment interactions for most. Variability in grain number per square meter was significantly correlated with P (p 0. 05). Heritability estimates for P and E were larger than estimates for CGR, grain number per square meter, or yield. A multitrait, <b>multienvironment</b> approach over CGR, P, and E identified 12 QTL (LOD ≥ 2. 5), explaining 21 to 36 % of observed trait variability. No QTL were detected for CGR, while two and one environmentally consistent QTL were found for P and E, respectively. Results highlighted relevant information that could be potentially exploited in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} biometrical and quantitative-genetic parameters, {{not well known}} in Croatia, are being used for the most {{important}} agronomic traits to determine optimal genotype setting within a location as well as among 7 locations. Objectives of the study are to estimate and to compare 1) parameters of intra-environment setting (effective mean square error EMSE, in lattice design, relative efficiency RE, of lattice design LD, compared to randomized complete block design RCBD, and repeatability Rep, of a plot value), and 2) operative heritability h 2, as a parameter of inter-environment setting in an experiment with 72 maize hybrids. Trials were set up at four environments (two locations in two years) evaluating grain yield and stalk rot. EMSE values corresponded across environments for both traits, while the estimations for RE of LD varied inconsistently over environments and traits. Rep estimates were more different over environments than traits. Rep values did not correspond with h 2 estimates: Rep estimates for stalk rot were higher than those for grain yield, while h 2 for grain yield was higher than for stalk rot in all instances. Our results suggest that due to importance of genotype × environment interaction, {{there is a need}} for <b>multienvironment</b> trials for both traits. If the experiment framework should be reduced due to economic or other reasons, decreasing number of locations in a year rather than decreasing number of years of investigation is recommended...|$|E
40|$|In {{designed}} {{experiments and}} in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess {{the effect of a}} quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a <b>multienvironment</b> agricultural field experiment in which a yield-seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and nonsmooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented...|$|E
40|$|While {{genotype}} × environment interactions (G × E) impede {{progress in}} plant breeding, efforts have {{focused more on}} their statistical analysis than on characterizing crop environments per se. Environmental conditions are commonly the major sources of yield variation across breeding trials, and their characterization may improve breeding efficiency. This chapter reviews different facets of environment characterization, including how to describe the target population of environments (TPE; i. e. conditions to which future-release cultivars might be subjected), and how to identify relevant environment classes where genotypes are expected to perform similarly. Due to seasonal variability and resource constraints, <b>multienvironment</b> breeding trials typically offer a biased representation of the TPE. Weighted analysis based on how representative trials can help breeders correct for this bias, and select for germplasm better adapted to the TPE. Managed-environment trials are another way to evaluate performance in representative environments or for particular stresses, allowing detailed assessment of germplasm, traits or genes of interest. While limited resources restrict the collection of experimental data, modeling tools offer a cost-effective avenue to explore the complex genotype × environment × management (G × E × M) interactions and, in particular, to assess the potential value of traits and alleles depending on 2 ̆ 7 genetic backgrounds 2 ̆ 7 (G × G and trait × trait interactions), environments (e. g. current and future climates) and management practices. Challenges, significance and limitations of environment characterization are discussed in the context of crop improvement...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} task of <b>multienvironment</b> trials (MET) analysis is evaluation of testing sites for megaenvironment differentiation and selection of "ideal" candidate location {{to improve the}} efficiency of cultivar selection and recommendation. The objectives of this research work were (i) to divide the Spanish cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) testing locations into megaenvironments and (ii) to separate the testing locations based on their distance to the "ideal" location, discriminating ability, representativeness, and uniqueness. GGE biplot was employed to analyze eight 1 -yr and two multiyear (3 -yr, 4 -yr) balanced datasets from 1999 to 2006 cotton trials of Delta & Pine Land Co. in Spain for yield, fiber quality traits, a selection index (SI) based on yield and quality, and Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae Kleb.) disease infestation level. Yearly GGE biplots revealed crossover genotype x location interactions, but not large enough to divide the area into different megaenvironments. Therefore, the Spanish cotton region may {{be considered as a}} complex megaenvironment and cultivar recommendation may be based on both mean performance and stability. Las Cabezas location was the closest to an ideal based on both yield and the SI regardless of the change from plastic to nonplastic mulching cultural practice. Aznalcazar did not provide unique information and could be dropped as a test site. The separation of test locations for their discriminating ability and representativeness provided useful information on the effectiveness of each testing location for developing and/or recommending cultivars with specific or broad adaptation. In this sense, Lebrija could be considered as trait-specific selection environment for early screening of verticillium tolerant genotypes...|$|E
