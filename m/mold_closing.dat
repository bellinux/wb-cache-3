40|$|Time {{consumption}} {{is the major}} drawback of many existing set-ups for permeability measurement. This drawback has prevented many researchers from studying the statistical distribution of experimentally obtained permeability values. To overcome this problem-while maintaining the necessary accuracy-an automated central injection rig for permeability identification called `PIERS set-up' (permeability identification using electrical resistance sensors) was developed. The PIERS set-up was used to characterize two typical glass fiber reinforcements. The test results demonstrated the presence of large scatter in the identified permeability values and hence the necessity to consider a statistical distribution of permeability values. The existence of a permeability distribution implies that {{a small number of}} measurements will not be sufficient to fully characterize the material. This paper discusses the necessary number of measurements to adequately characterize the statistical distribution and investigates the origins of the observed scatter. The paper also shows that the nesting of layers during stacking and <b>mold</b> <b>closing</b> is a major source of the observed variations in permeability values. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In liquid {{composite}} molding, such as RTM or SRIM, the dry reinforcement {{is first}} compressed in the mold, {{and then the}} resin is injected into the mold cavity and cured. Knowledge of the compressibility of the reinforcement is important in order to estimate the <b>mold</b> <b>closing</b> force and the attainable range of fiber volume fraction. Moreover, in a lay-up composed of several types of fabrics, the compressibility of each fabric should be known to predict the thickness of each fabric layer, which {{is a prerequisite for}} the mold filling simulation. In this work, the relaxation and compressibility of a new sandwich fabric, Multimat(R), and its components (a weft knit and a random mat) were studied and compared with a woven fabric. The different fabric relaxation behavior is explained in terms of fabric stiffness and volumetric dissipation energy, Fabric compression tests were performed by taking the fabric relaxation behavior into account. Fabric compression curves are fitted with the power law equation and agree well with the clamping pressure experimentally measured with a pressure transducer in an RTM mold. The influence of the number of layers was also investigated. Finally the compressibility of the Multimat is correlated to its components with a simple model. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the <b>mold</b> <b>closes</b> while the bladder inflates. As the <b>mold</b> <b>closes</b> and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the <b>mold</b> <b>closed</b> via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R

40|$|The current paper {{addresses}} High Pressure Compression Resin Transfer Molding (HP-CRTM) for {{the manufacturing}} of continuous fiber reinforced composites with high fiber volume content. The HP-CRTM {{process is a}} combination of resin transfer molding (RTM) and compression molding. In this process, the preform is placed into the mold cavity and then the <b>mold</b> is <b>closed</b> partially to obtain a small gap between the mold surface and the fiber preform. The resin is introduced through a suitable injection point into the gap and flows easily over the preform and may partially impregnate the preform as well. Once the required amount of resin is injected into the gap and the injection point is <b>closed,</b> the <b>mold</b> <b>closes</b> further and applies high compression pressure to squeeze the resin into the preform. In this step, the preform is compacted to achieve the desired part thickness and fiber volume fraction. The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the effects of parameters such as mold opening distance and fiber orientation {{on the quality of the}} HP-CRTM components.

40|$|A new process, vented {{compression}} molding, {{is developed}} for molding low density particulates, such as ablative {{materials used in}} the Space Shuttle. This process is a modification of standard compression molding that uses a perforated surface as the molding surface. An excess of material is used to fill the mold cavity and this material is forced through the openings in {{the surface of the}} mold as the <b>mold</b> <b>closes.</b> This process creates frictional forces, which can be determined approximately by Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, generating the pressure that compacts the material. The pressure in the mold is shown to be governed by the geometry of the openings and the mechanical properties of the particulate, and not by the displacement or the volume of the mold. It is determined that this uncoupling of the pressure-displacement relationship allows uniform material distribution and compaction without requiring large-scale flow of the particulates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Injection Molding Machine (IMM) {{has been}} widely used for the mass {{production}} of a plastic product. With {{the development of the}} relative technique, various injection molding techniques have been developed and we could get more precise plastic product. In this paper, we present the system reliability of an IMM subject to a controller. The controller of an IMM {{is an important factor in}} the injection molding and this controller has direct influence on the quality of a plastic product. Presently, the <b>mold</b> <b>close</b> and open control method of a toggle type IMM is openloop control. Open-loop method is difficult to control when they affect highly nonlinear characteristic in an IMM. Therefore, we propose an alternate approach to implement the controller using closed-loop control method to enhance the reliability. Through the development, fuzzy control algorithm is selected and it is programmed by an IL(Instruction List) and a LD(Ladder Diagram) on a PC based PLC. For the development of an IMM controller, PC based PLC of PCI card type, distributed I/O modules with CANopen, Industrial PC and HMI(Human Machine Interface) software are used...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Injection molding of {{thermosetting}} elastomers {{has become}} an important processing technique within recent years. The material enters the injection head at a temperature below the vulcanization point. It is fed by a screw and injected with a ram-like action into a <b>closed</b> <b>mold.</b> Vulcanization of the rubber occurs in the heated mold. The elastomer must flow from the injection chamber into the <b>closed</b> <b>mold</b> through nozzles, channels, sprues, and gates. Pressure drops occur and the material temperature increases as heat is transferred from the mold walls and internal heat is generated by viscous shear. Analytical methods of describing this flow are useful in modifying the mold configuration to increase flow. The basic flow equations are discussed, simplifications are made and a numerical solution of the set of equations describing the flow of a highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid is outlined. Heat transfer {{from the wall and}} generation of heat due to viscous shear is considered.
