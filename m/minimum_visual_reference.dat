Specifically, the weather must be better than basic VFR weather <b>minima,</b> i.e. in <b>visual</b> meteorological conditions (VMC), as specified in the rules of the relevant aviation authority. The pilot must be able to operate the aircraft with <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to the ground, and by visually avoiding obstructions and other aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|The {{criterion}} for landing {{is known as}} decision height. ICAO defines Decision Height as [...] "a specified altitude or height in the precision approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to continue the approach has not been established." [...] When a pilot in approaching the ground, they must see a <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to continue the approach. <b>Visual</b> <b>references</b> are for example the runway markings ("zebra stripes"), runway lighting, and approach lights (see runway for more examples).If the pilot cannot see such a reference in the decision height, they must abort the landing, and then circle for a second approach or land elsewhere.|$|R

The results show that post-saccadic <b>visual</b> <b>references</b> are not necessary for compression: a consistent compression of verbally reported relative stimulus distances is found at all shutter latencies and at all post-shutter levels of illumination. They also show that positions indicated by blind pointing show no compression except when <b>visual</b> <b>references</b> remain in view for a substantial time after saccades. These results confirm that the visual system uses multiple representations of space and suggest that it weights them differently for different tasks and different viewing conditions.
