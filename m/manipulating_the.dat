5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> {{hand-operated}} controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Weaver, {{now living}} in Dubbo, contested the seat of Ashburnham for the Liberal Party but was {{defeated}} on 46-53% against the Labor Party's John Lynch. Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, accusing the Labor Party of <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching {{an altitude of}} a few hundred feet, the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E

5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> environment, {{the player}} solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi reveals to Naruto that Minato {{intended}} {{to combine the}} Rasengan with his elemental chakra {{but was unable to}} complete the technique. Naruto is able to complete his father's work through the use of shadow clones. In order to perform it, Naruto requires the aid of two shadow clones; he provides the chakra, one clone is responsible for the shape transformation, and the other provides the nature transformation. By <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> wind-natured chakra of the Wind Release: Rasengan, Naruto was able to create four large points, causing the Rasengan to take on the appearance of a giant fūma shuriken, with the Rasengan in the center remaining a perfect sphere. The technique gives off a loud screech-like noise during and following formation.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft Go is a 2015 turn-based puzzle {{video game}} in the Tomb Raider series. The player moves Lara Croft as a puzzle piece through a board game while {{avoiding}} obstacles and <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> environment. The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit Lara Croft Go time-independent gameplay. Square Enix Montreal developed the game as a spiritual successor to its 2014 Hitman Go, based on another Square Enix franchise. The company released Lara Croft Go in August 2015 for Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone devices. A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was unveiled in November 2016. In 4. December 2016. it's released on Steam.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hannegan {{makes an}} {{alliance}} with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors. Hannegan, however, is <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him {{in control of the}} entire region. Monsignor Apollo, the papal nuncio to Hannegan's court, sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the empire of Denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. For his actions, Apollo is executed, and Hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death. The Church excommunicates Hannegan.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of the bishops {{has been seen as}} a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} the bishops signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Monument Valley is an indie puzzle game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ustwo Games. The player leads the princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> world around her to reach various platforms. Monument Valley was developed over ten months beginning in early 2013 based on concept drawings by company artist Ken Wong. Its visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and , and was compared by critics to M. C. Escher drawings and Echochrome. The art was designed such that each frame would be worthy of public display. After a closed beta test, it was released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and was later ported to Android and Windows Phone. The game received generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its art and sound design, but noted its lack of difficulty and short length. It won a 2014 Apple Design Award, was named Apple's best iPad game of 2014, and sold over two million copies by January 2015; by May 2016, sales of the game exceeded 26 million.|$|E

5|$|On April 3, 2005, {{eight months}} after the release of Doom 3, id Software {{released}} an expansion pack for Doom 3 on Windows. The expansion, entitled Resurrection of Evil, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that had partnered with id Software on several other projects, including Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the Xbox conversion of Doom. Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on May 24, 2005, and an Xbox version followed on October 5, 2005. The expansion featured a new twelve-level single player campaign, set two years after the original storyline, as well as three new weapons, one of which is geared towards <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> physics in the game. Several new enemy characters were also introduced. Multiplayer gameplay was enhanced, officially increasing the player limit to eight and adding new game modes such as capture the flag. Resurrection of Evils reception was not as positive as it had been for Doom 3, but still received generally favorable reviews from the industry's critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different colored lights with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E
