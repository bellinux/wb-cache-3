For continued sustainable progress, GPU computing at scale also need to address two open issues: a) how increase applications {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) as we increase supercom-puter’s component counts; and b) how to minimize unnecessary energy consumption. Since energy consumption is defined by the number of components used, we consider a sustainable high performance computing (HPC) application can allow better performance and reliability at the same time when adding computing or communication components. This paper reports a two-tier semantic statistical multiplexing framework for sustainable HPC at scale. The idea is to leverage the powers of statistic multiplexing to tame the nagging HPC scalability challenges. We include the theoretical model, sustainability analysis and computational experiments with automatic system level multiple CPU/GPU failure containment.

40|$|Sparse code {{multiple}} access (SCMA) {{is a new}} frequency domain non-orthogonal multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of <b>multiplexed</b> <b>layers</b> exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism.

However, current approaches focus only on one linguistic relationship at a time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language.

We investigate the topology of the resulting multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers and the full multiplex structure {{on their ability to}} predict empirically observed age of acquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the multiplex topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{has been carried out}} for the role played by anticipation in human cognition (Brône 2012; Coulson 2005; Huron 2006). Employing the terms “anticipation” and “expectation” interchangeably, these studies emphasize only the temporal sequentiality between elements taking place at different points in time, a relation parallel to the progression of time. In modes of communication where simultaneous events are possible, however, there exists a similar but distinct relation between elements simultaneously represented in time. This is expectation, a relation perpendicular to the progression of time. Ubiquitous and indispensable for our understanding of the most ordinary, the relation of expectation has hardly been recognized let alone analyzed in the literature. 	In view of this, in the present study I contemplate on the nature of expectation, identifying and integrating in a coherent way theoretical notions relevant to the analysis of expectation, including among others the progression of time, conceptual distance (Gärdenfors 2000), processes of conceptual integration and disintegration (Fauconnier and Turner 2002), construction (Croft 2001; Langacker 2008), and intention. Analyzed for illustration are two passages from Wagner’s music drama Siegfried: While in the first passage Mime sings words of care and love to music of complaint, in the second, a honeyed tune is heard accompanying the murderous intentions in Mime’s words. The cross-modal mismatch in both cases stretches the conceptual distance between Mime’s words and music, imposing tension on the listener’s expectation that simultaneously represented language and music should “support” each other. Meanwhile, elements from the language and the music inputs, as well as the unexpected mismatch, are projected into a blend, where new meanings emerge and the mismatch is made sense of. Drawing upon Clark’s (1996) insight, the <b>multiplex</b> <b>layers</b> of pretense and coatings of meaning in the convoluted social-interactional dynamics in the two passages are also disentangled and laid out. 	The analysis of the two passages with cross-modal mismatch underlines the centrality of the hitherto overlooked relation of expectation, and that, much like unfulfilled anticipation, unfulfilled expectation also yields strong emotional effects. The stark contrast between the ease of our understanding of the two passages and the complexity of the analysis further highlights the agility of the cognitive processing that allows us {{to make sense of the}} world we are exposed to.
