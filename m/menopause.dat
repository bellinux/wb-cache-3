5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed <b>menopause.</b> The average age of <b>menopause</b> in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. <b>Menopause</b> before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of <b>menopause</b> is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause <b>menopause</b> to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (<b>menopause</b> or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While <b>menopause</b> may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While <b>menopause</b> generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature <b>menopause)</b> as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When <b>menopause</b> occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} or spotting {{in women}} after <b>menopause</b> occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases. Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before <b>menopause</b> {{may also be a}} sign of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with <b>menopause,</b> her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after <b>menopause</b> is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its strong}} {{advantage}} among younger women, and baby boomers reaching <b>menopause,</b> Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive market research, Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator {{designed to be}} as visually appealing as it was functional, and making the brand once again appealing to teens.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during <b>menopause),</b> {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after <b>menopause.</b> Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after <b>menopause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or <b>menopause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late <b>menopause,</b> high levels of estrogen, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most {{commonly}} before {{and around the}} time of <b>menopause.</b> In the United States they are more common in whites, particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the <b>menopause.</b> Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the <b>menopause,</b> such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed <b>menopause</b> as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering <b>menopause.</b> However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though <b>menopause,</b> {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the <b>menopause.</b> The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the <b>menopause.</b> Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before <b>menopause.</b> Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Wong's {{father died}} in Los Angeles {{at the age of}} 91. After a six-year absence, Wong {{returned}} to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called Impact. From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she played the title role which used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of <b>menopause,</b> her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached <b>menopause,</b> it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature <b>menopause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early <b>menopause.</b> This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins <b>menopause</b> and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early <b>menopause.</b> Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
25|$|The {{theories}} {{discussed above}} assume that evolution directly selected for <b>menopause.</b> Another theory states that <b>menopause</b> is the {{byproduct of the}} evolutionary selection for follicular atresia, a factor that causes <b>menopause.</b> <b>Menopause</b> results from having too few ovarian follicles to produce enough estrogen to maintain the ovarian-pituitary-hypothalamic loop, which results in the cessation of menses {{and the beginning of}} <b>menopause.</b> Human females are born with approximately a million oocytes, and approximately 400 oocytes are lost to ovulation throughout life.|$|E
25|$|Within the United States, social {{location}} {{affects the}} way women perceive <b>menopause</b> and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views <b>menopause</b> as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status. The paradigm within which a woman considers <b>menopause</b> influences the way she views it: Women who understand <b>menopause</b> as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who {{view it as a}} life transition or a symbol of aging.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{assessing}} {{the impact on}} women {{of some of these}} <b>menopause</b> effects are the Greene climacteric scale questionnaire, the Cervantes scale and the <b>Menopause</b> rating scale.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the sudden fall in estradiol during <b>menopause,</b> the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural <b>menopause</b> on circulating androgen levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural <b>menopause</b> cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menopause</b> {{occurs because}} of the sharp {{decrease}} of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After <b>menopause,</b> estrogen continues to be produced mostly by aromatase in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally. The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at <b>menopause</b> impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.|$|E
25|$|Where an {{underlying}} cause can be identified, treatment may {{be directed at}} this. Clearly heavy periods at menarche and <b>menopause</b> may settle spontaneously (the menarche being the start and <b>menopause</b> being the cessation of periods).|$|E
25|$|The <b>menopause</b> {{transition}} typically begins between 40 and 50 {{years of}} age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years. Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (perimenopause and <b>menopause)</b> {{about the same time}} as their mother did.|$|E
25|$|Before <b>menopause,</b> obesity can {{increase}} a person's risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk {{is not present}} after <b>menopause.</b> This risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used HRT. A similar association with ovarian cancer appears in taller people.|$|E
25|$|Some {{women have}} an {{increase}} in sexual desire following <b>menopause.</b> Masters and Johnson's research indicates that menopausal women who continue to engage in sexual activity regularly experience vaginal lubrication similar to levels in women who have not entered <b>menopause,</b> and can enjoy sexual intercourse fully.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menopause,</b> {{also known}} as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. <b>Menopause</b> {{typically}} occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define <b>menopause</b> as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, <b>menopause</b> may be viewed to have occurred {{at the time of the}} surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Most {{women of}} {{reproductive}} age develop small cysts each month, and large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before <b>menopause.</b> Ovarian cysts {{are present in}} about 16% of women after <b>menopause</b> and if present {{are more likely to}} be cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} {{context within which}} a woman lives can {{have a significant impact}} on the way she experiences the menopausal transition. <b>Menopause</b> has been described as a subjective experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way <b>menopause</b> is experienced and perceived.|$|E
