40|$|Abstract The Census Bureau is {{carrying}} out {{research with the}} intent of improving the housing unit-based method for estimating population totals. One approach is to use the Decennial Census as the baseline for measures and update them annually using American Community Survey (ACS) data to estimate their change since the census year. This study looks at the possibility of using an Empirical Bayes approach to produce county estimates of change with smaller variances than direct ACS estimates. Results from national and state models are compared. Data from the 1990 and 2000 long form samples are used to represent ACS and data from the 1990 and 2000 short form are used as independent variables in the models. In the actual application, sources for the latter would be the <b>Master</b> <b>Address</b> file and Administrative Records...|$|E

The MAF is the Census Bureau’s official inventory of known living quarters (housing units [HUs] and group quarters [GQs] facilities) and selected nonresidential units (public, private, and commercial) in the United States and Puerto Rico. It contains mailing and location address information, geocodes, and other attribute information about each living quarter. (A geocoded address is one for which state, county, census tract, and block have been identified.) The MAF is linked to the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER ®) system. TIGER ® is a database containing a digital representation of all census-required map features and related attributes. It is a resource for the production of maps, data tabulation, and the automated assignment of addresses to geographic locations in geocoding. The initial MAF was created for Census 2000 using multiple sources, including the 1990 Address Control File, the U. S. Postal Service’s (USPS’s) Delivery Sequence File (DSF), field listing operations, and addresses supplied by local governments through partnership operations. The MAF was use...|$|E

The analysis also developed a multilevel regression model, for which some of the standard estimation and inference procedures in those models can be applied [7]. Lumley and Scott [5, 8] demonstrated building regression models—in particular, linear and generalized linear models—using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). They also provided a thorough discussion about testing in such regression models being fit to survey data. Young et al. [9] demonstrated the appropriateness of using zero-inflated regression models for understanding housing unit adds or deletes in the United States based on the Census Bureau’s <b>Master</b> <b>Address</b> File (MAF). In each of the above examples, inference or variable selection procedures can be employed to determine the “best” predictor variables for the respective model. However, choosing the best strategy for selecting from a large number of predictor variables can be challenging, especially in survey data where multicollinearity is almost always an issue. One appealing approach for such settings is to use dimension reduction.|$|E

The MAF is the Census Bureau’s official inventory of known living quarters and selected nonresidential units in the United States (U. S.) and Puerto Rico. Independent HU address samples are selected {{for each of the}} 3, 142 counties and county equivalents in the U. S., including the District of Columbia, for the ACS.

40|$|For decades, the U. S. Census Bureau has {{conducted}} {{a number of}} large-scale household surveys, including the venerable Current Population Survey. The American Community Survey (ACS) recently became the largest. Until the ACS, samples for these surveys were usually drawn using a mixture of address and sometimes area frames from the previous decennial census, supplemented by frames for new construction. Although census data were reflected in the sampling design, estimation for the ACS and other surveys {{has been based on}} complex forms of ratio estimation to independent totals, without further incorporating frame information. Beginning with Census 2000, the U. S. Census Bureau now maintains a <b>Master</b> <b>Address</b> File (MAF) as a current inventory of housing units. The MAF provides the sampling frame for the ACS and the redesigned versions of the other major demographic surveys. This change to a housing-unit frame presents an opportunity to investigate possible model-assisted approaches to estimation. Model-assisted estimation affords an approach to incorporate information from the frame into the estimation, information that might include data from the previous census or administrative records. Moreover, modelassisted estimation uses auxiliary information in an essentially design-unbiased way, whereas model-based alternatives generally share the risk of introducing substantial bias. This paper will report on initial results for ACS using data for 36 test counties during 1999 - 2001. It will also suggest how similar principles could be applied to other demographic surveys. 1...|$|E

The Census Bureau is currently conducting evaluations to support the goal of using a MAF-based frame to replace the current multiple frames for the 2010 Demographic Survey Redesign. The current frames include a unit frame, a group quarters (GQ) frame, a permit frame, and an area frame. The unit frame and the GQ frame cover addresses of housing units and group quarters that existed {{during the time of}} Census 2000 in blocks that had a high percent complete addresses, i. e., addresses that had a house number, a street name, and a zip code, and had building permit coverage. The permit frame obtains addresses from building permit offices (BPOs) to capture new construction after Census 2000 in blocks that had building permit coverage. For the remaining universe that is primarily in rural areas, an area frame approach is used. The current area frame covers approximately 12 % of the addresses in the U. S. The field operations used to collect addresses for the permit frame and the area frame are expensive. The MAF is an inventory of addresses for all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico and is maintained by the Census Bureau.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{research}} and analysis undertaken by Census Bureau staff. It has undergone a more limited review than official Census Bureau publications. This report is released to inform interested parties of research and to encourage discussion. This paper describes a research project done by the Census Bureau to evaluate {{the coverage of the}} <b>Master</b> <b>Address</b> File (MAF). Basically, the MAF is intended to eventually be a list of all addresses in the United States. It will be used for the mailout of Census forms for Census 2000 and for the new American Community Survey, as well as a sampling frame for the Census Bureau’s current surveys. In order to better understand the accuracy and completeness of the MAF, the Demographic Statistical Methods Division of the Census Bureau formed an Evaluation Group to study the coverage of the MAF. To do the evaluation, we compared the addresses contained in the MAF to recent area segment listings produced for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The comparison was done within Census blocks, small geographic areas created and used by the Census Bureau to collect and tabulate data. The MAF is created using a number of steps. The initial MAF building process begins with the input of city-style addresses from two basic address sources-the Address Control File and the Delivery Sequence File. The Address Control File (ACF) is a nationwide inventory of all living quarters enumerated during the 1990 Decennial Census of Population and Housing. Although somewhat out-of-date, the ACF is an important address source because it contains housing units that may not be mail delivery points...|$|E

These products support current surveys, decennial censuses, estimates programs, partnership programs, and the public need for geospatial data. For the 2010 Census field operations, the US Census Bureau’s Geography Division (GEO) delivered over 17 million unique map sheets, 10 Geographic Reference Files (GRFs) containing 6. 7 million blocks, and eight full MAF Extracts of over 144 million addresses. These products are generated from the <b>Master</b> <b>Address</b> File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Product Database (PDB) that is created from the current MAF/TIGER transaction database (MTDB) through a Benchmarking process. The MTDB was developed as part of the MAF/TIGER Redesign project, and was a major step forward for GEO’s management of spatial and address data. The system utilized Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software including Oracle Spatial and Topology Data Model. The design included persistent topology and a seamless national database that integrated the spatial and address data. It facilitated real time updates and maintenance of business rules. However, to effectively support continuous flow-based {{on-time delivery}} of data products, a multi-level geospatial database design approach was adopted. The design resulted in the implementation of a complimentary database to the current MTDB known as the MAF/TIGER Product Database (PDB). The PDB utilizes a denormalized database design approach where tables from the current MTDB are combined, derived fields are stored, and there is no explicit storage of topology.
