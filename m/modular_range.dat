40|$|The Design For Assembly (DFA) {{approach}} {{can be applied to}} reduce production costs by an optimization of the assembly sequence of a product. DFA methods are mostly applied during the detailed design phase of the product design process. In early stages of this design process, and situated in a routine design context, we propose to couple modularity with DFA in a “High productive” way to generate <b>modular</b> product <b>ranges</b> respecting assembly constraints added to functional constraints. This approach is the opposite to traditional DFA applications that are performed on detailed products. Our global methodology generates <b>modular</b> product <b>ranges,</b> including various principles, but we only focus, in this paper, on the functional design and modular design aspects, based on the DFA principles, with our specific algorithm for providing ordered assembly sequences. Our algorithm is applied on a coloured directed graph, which models the precedence relationships between components and their assignments to technical functions. Partition of the Part-Part matrix and identification of specific patterns allow aggregating some components in modules. Based on this graph, a constraint satisfaction problem is solved to generate all the ordered assembly sequences. An experimental case study on a pneumatic scraper is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology. At the end of the case study, it is possible to obtain an assembly sequence, which is as consistent as possible with a modular architecture of the product...|$|R

This system is assembled in two synthetic, <b>modular,</b> broad-host <b>range</b> plasmids based on pBBR 1 and RK 2 origins of replication, allowing its utilization in an extensive number of gram-negative bacteria. We analyze the performance of this dual cassette in two hosts, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, by examining the induction properties of the lacI(q) -Ptrc expression system in the first host and the Pb promoter of the benzoate degradation pathway in the second host. By quantifying the bioluminescence signal produced through {{the expression of the}} lux genes, we explore the dynamic range of induction for the two systems (Ptrc-based and Pb-based) in response to the two inducers. In addition, by quantifying the fluorescence signals produced by GFP expression, we were able to monitor the single-cell expression profile and to explore stochasticity of the same two promoters by flow cytometry.

The original design of the electronic control system was based on the philosophy of parallel processing, but these ideas could at that time only be implemented to a very limited extent.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) {{are one of}} the {{potentially}} most efficient and clean energy conversion technologies for electric utility applications. Laboratory cells have shown extraordinary durability, and actual utility-scale prototypes have worked very well. The main obstacle to commercialization has been the relatively high manufacturing cost. To reduce these costs, efforts have been underway for several years to adapt manufacturing technology from the semiconductor industry to the SOFCs; however, tape casting, screen printing and similar methods are more applicable to planar configurations than to the more proven tubular ones. In planar cells the bipolar plate and edge seals become more critical elements, and material selection may have repercussions for the other fuel cell components. Ferritic stainless steel bipolar plates may be a good choice for reducing the cost of the stacks, but ferritic steels oxidize rapidly at temperatures above 800 C. Inexorably, one is led to the conclusion that anodes, cathodes and electrolytes operating below 800 C need to be found. Another motivation for developing planar SOFCs operating at reduced temperature is the prospect of new non-utility applications. The U. S. Department of Energy has initiated the Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) program for developing small <b>modular</b> stacks <b>ranging</b> in capacity from 5 to 10 kW{sup (1) }. This size range meets the power requirements of auxiliary power units for heavy and perhaps even light-duty vehicles, and also for remote stationary applications. In terms of electric capacity, the distributed electric utility market may well exceed the potential market for APUs, but the number of units produced could be higher for the latter, yielding cost benefits related to mass production. On the other hand, the fuel for use in transportation or remote stationary applications will consist of gasoline, diesel or propane, which contain higher sulfur levels than natural gas. Anodes with some resistance to sulfur poisoning would be desirable. Also, during the more frequent shutdowns and startups in these applications, the anodes may get exposed to air. Typical nickel-based SOFC anodes may not tolerate air exposure very well and may need to be modified. Argonne National Laboratory is engaged in developing new materials options for SECA applications, as discussed here...|$|R
