40|$|Breast {{conservation}} surgery after {{large volume}} excisions {{for women with}} relatively larger or multicentric operable breast cancer (OBC) and in some locally advanced breast cancers (LABC) post neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), {{is known to be}} a feasible option using a latissimus dorsi flap. However, the oncological safety of such a procedure is not well reported in literature. Two hundred and twenty one women with breast cancer (148 -OBC, 73 -LABC) underwent BCT plus LD during March 1998 to August 2009. One hundred and forty six women (72 -LABC, 66 -OBC) received prior NACT for downstaging, followed by completion of adjuvant therapy in all, including postoperative radiotherapy and hormone therapy where indicated. Women aged 20 – 62  years, with tumors 1. 5 – 15  cm (median 5. 0  cm), underwent volume replacement surgery with LD flap. All positive cut margins (total- 4. 9 %, gross positive- 1. 3 %) were re-excised to ensure negative margins. The mean surgical time for excision of primary with axillary clearance followed by volume replacement by LD was 5  h and mean hospital stay 6  days. Donor site morbidity was seen in 11 patients and 3 had <b>minor</b> <b>recipient</b> site infection. At a median follow up of 36  months, ten of 221 patients (4. 5 %) had failed locally (7 -OBC, 3 -LABC). The determinants of local recurrence were presence of lymphatic vascular invasion (p[*]=[*] 0. 016) and axillary metastasis (p[*]=[*] 0. 003). BCT plus LD flap is an oncologically safe, technically quick procedure with minimal morbidity, and should be offered to all eligible women as an extended breast conservation procedure...|$|E

Twenty-two of 76 evaluable patients were transplanted over a major ABO-mismatch compatibility barrier. These patients showed an increased delay in erythroid engraftment and in time to red blood cell transfusion independence when compared with ABO-identical or <b>minor</b> mismatched <b>recipients.</b> No difference in granulocyte or platelet engraftment was evident. Erythroid engraftment usually occurred spontaneously without specific intervention. One patient {{was found to have}} erythroid hypoplasia at day 201 after BMT, despite therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose erythropoietin. An anti-A titer of 16, 000 was documented. This patient was successfully treated with an aggressive course of 18 plasmapheresis procedures and with donor-type plasma replacement. Delayed erythroid engraftment is common after non-T cell-depleted major ABO-mismatched BMT in CML, but rarely requires intervention other than transfusion support. Rare cases of refractory erythroid aplasia may be treated without additional immunosuppression by aggressive plasma exchange with donor-type plasma.

40|$|Inducible costimulatory {{molecule}} (ICOS) plays {{a pivotal role}} in T cell activation and Th 1 /Th 2 differentiation. ICOS blockade has disparate effects on immune responses depending on the timing of blockade. Its role in transplantation immunity, however, remains incompletely defined. We used a vascularized mouse cardiac allograft model to explore the role of ICOS signaling at different time points after transplantation, targeting immune initiation (early blockade) or the immune effector phase (delayed blockade). In major histocompatibility–mismatched recipients, ICOS blockade prolonged allograft survival using both protocols but did so more effectively in the delayed-treatment group. By contrast, in <b>minor</b> histocompatibility–mismatched <b>recipients,</b> early blockade accelerated rejection and delayed blockade prolonged graft survival. Alloreactive CD 4 + T cell expansion and alloantibody production were suppressed in both treatment groups, whereas only delayed blockade resulted in suppression of effector CD 8 + T cell generation. After delayed ICOS blockade, there was a diminished frequency of allospecific IL- 10 –producing cells and an increased frequency of both IFN-γ– and IL- 4 –producing cells. The beneficial effects of ICOS blockade in regulating allograft rejection were seen in the absence of CD 28 costimulation but required CD 8 + cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen- 4, and an intact signal transducer and activator of transcription– 6 pathway. These data define the complex functions of the ICOS-B 7 h pathway in regulating alloimmune responses in vivo...|$|R

We report the histopathology of rejection in an established model of SpTx in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -defined miniature swine. Of the 17 SpTx, rejection was observed in two grafts transplanted into untreated, MHC-matched, <b>minor</b> antigen-disparate <b>recipients</b> (group 1, n = 4), {{but not in the}} two that received a 12 -day course of cyclosporin A (CyA). Rejection also occurred in five grafts transplanted into fully MHC-disparate recipients (group 2, n = 12), one of which was untreated and four of which received some form of immunosuppressive therapy. One recipient of an MHC class-I-mismatched spleen treated with 12 days of CyA did not show rejection. Following biopsy and/or necropsy, fixed allograft tissue sections were treated with multiple stains, immunohistochemical markers and TUNEL assay. Common features of rejection occurred in grafts from both groups, but with varying time courses. Necrosis developed as early as day 8 in group 2 and day 27 in group 1, ranging from focal fibrinoid necrosis of arteriolar walls and sinusoids to diffuse liquefactive necrosis, usually associated with haemorrhage. Other features of rejection included white pulp expansion by atypical cells and decreased staining of basement membranes and reticular fibres. A doubling of the baseline TUNEL index preceded histologically identifiable rejection. This study establishes histologic guidelines for diagnosing and, perhaps, in future studies, predicting acute rejection of splenic allografts transplanted across known histocompatibility barriers in a large-animal model...|$|R
50|$|For a blood {{transfusion}} to take place, the donor and recipient must be of compatible blood types. Dogs have eleven blood types but are born without antibodies in their blood.

40|$|AbstractBortezomib, a {{proteasome}} inhibitor {{capable of}} direct antitumor effects, {{has been shown}} to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) when administered in a short course immediately after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice. However, when bortezomib is given continuously, CD 4 + T cell–mediated gastrointestinal tract damage increases GVHD mortality. To investigate the protective effects of bortezomib on other organs, we used a CD 8 -dependent acute GVHD (aGVHD) model of C 3 H. SW donor T cells engrafted into irradiated C 57 BL/ 6 <b>recipients</b> (<b>minor</b> MHC mismatch), which lack significant gut GVHD. Our data in this model show that bortezomib can be given continuously to prevent and treat aGVHD mediated by CD 8 + T cells, but this effect is organ specific, such that only skin, and not liver, protection was observed. Despite the lack of hepatic protection, bortezomib still significantly improved survival, primarily because of its skin protection. Reduced skin GVHD by bortezomib was correlated with reduced serum and skin IL- 6 levels. Administration of a blocking IL- 6 antibody in this model also resulted in similar cutaneous GVHD protection. These results indicate that bortezomib or blockade of IL- 6 may prevent CD 8 + T cell–mediated cutaneous acute GVHD...|$|R

40|$|The {{lymphocytic}} infiltration {{found in}} multiple cultured BALB/c thyroids {{placed in the}} same C 57 BL/ 6 recipient {{was found to be}} highly correlated and the high variability between animals was not influenced by the number of lobes. It was concluded that the variable infiltration was largely due to host factors. Because a similar correlation was found between BALB/c and C 3 H grafts, the response to a minor antigen common to these two strains was suggested as a cause of the infiltration. When the response of C 57 BL/ 6 mice to cultured B 6. C (H- 2 d) and BALB. B (H- 2 b) grafts was compared, a synergism between major and minor antigens was suggested. However, when the time of culture was increased from 48 to 60 h and the response of BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were compared with identically cultured B 6. C (H- 2 d) grafts, a striking difference between major and minor antigens was observed.

A total of 7 patients with recurrent leukemia after major histocompatibility complex (MHC) –matched allogeneic HCT were treated with infusions of donor-derived, ex vivo–expanded CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for tissue-restricted recipient mHAgs. The safety of T-cell therapy, in vivo persistence of transferred CTLs, and disease response were assessed.

Despite similar allele frequencies between donors and <b>recipients,</b> <b>minor</b> allele of SDF 1 rs 1801157 (GA+AA) from donor, not from recipients, has a protective effect on the development of BPAR compared to wild type donor (GG) (P = 0. 005). Adjustment for multiple covariates did not affect this result (odds ratio 0. 39, 95 % C. I 0. 20 – 0. 76, P = 0. 006). CXCR 4 rs 2228014 polymorphisms from donor or recipient did not affect the incidence of acute rejection. SDF 1 was differentially expressed in renal tubular epithelium with acute rejection according to genetic variations of donor rs 1801157 showing higher expressions in the grafts from GG donors. Contrary to the development of BPAR, the presence of minor allele rs 1801157 A, especially homozygocity, predisposed poor graft survival (P = 0. 001).

40|$|In bone marrow-transplanted patients, chronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} is a {{complication}} that results from the persistent stimulation of <b>recipient</b> <b>minor</b> histocompatibility Ag (mHA) -specific T cells contained within the graft. In this study, we developed a mouse model where persistent stimulation of donor T cells by recipient's mHA led to multiorgan T cell infiltration. Exposure to systemic mHA, however, deeply modified T cell function and chronically stimulated T cells developed a long-lasting state of unresponsiveness, or immune adaptation, characterized by their inability to mediate organ immune damages in vivo. However, analysis of the gene expression profile of adapted CD 4 + T cells revealed the specific coexpression of genes known to promote differentiation and function of Th 1 effector cells as well as genes coding for proteins that control T cell activity, such as cell surface-negative costimulatory molecules and regulatory cytokines. Strikingly, blockade of negative costimulation abolished T cell adaptation and stimulated strong IFN-gamma production and severe multiorgan wasting disease. Negative costimulation was also shown to control lethal LPS-induced toxic shock in mice with adapted T cells, {{as well as the}} capacity of adapted T cells to reject skin graft. Our results demonstrate that negative costimulation is the molecular mechanism used by CD 4 + T cells to adapt their activity in response to persistent antigenic stimulation. The effector function of CD 4 + T cells that have adapted to chronic Ag presentation can be activated by stimuli strong enough to overcome regulatory signals delivered to the T cells by negative costimulation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

In previous studies we {{have reported that}} increased inflammatory cytokine expression in aged mice can be attenuated by oral gavage of a crude fetal extract containing glutathione (GSH), MPLA and fetal hemoglobin, or more specifically by injection {{of a combination of}} these purified reagents. We speculated that this combination led to an altered tissue redox environment in which the immune response developed, thus regulating inflammation. Accordingly, we used wild-type (WT) C 57 BL/ 6 mice, or mice lacking either murine beta Hemoglobin major (HgbβmaKO) or <b>minor</b> (HgbβmiKO) as <b>recipients</b> of DSS in their drinking water, and followed development of colitis both clinically and by inflammatory cytokine production, before/after oral treatment of mice with a crude fetal liver extract. Mice lacking an intact fetal hemoglobin chain (HgbβmiKO) developed severe colitis, with enhanced colonic expression of inflammatory cytokines, which could not be rescued by extract, unlike WT and HgbβmaKO animals. Moreover, disease in both WT and HgbβmaKO animals could also be attenuated by exposure to 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (5 HMF), hydroxyurea or rapamycin. The former has been used as an alternative means of stabilizing the conformation of adult hemoglobin in a manner which mimicks the oxygen-affinity of fetal hemoglobin, while we show that both hydroxyurea and rapamycin augment expression of murine fetal hemoglobin chains.

The DE loop (p 71 – 78) was identified as such a target region, and a panel of synthetic cyclized peptide mimics of this region were tested for their inhibitory effects on cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in human cell-mediated lympholysis assays. Peptide 1109 (CKRLGDTFVC) was most effective at inhibiting specific target cell lysis. Accordingly, studies were conducted {{to determine whether there}} was sufficient cross-species homology in the DE loop region and its nonpolymorphic interactive site on the β 2 -microglobulin domain of the MHC class I molecule to allow similar inhibition of murine CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. On the basis of strong in vitro inhibitory activity of 1109 in the murine system, the capacity of the peptide to inhibit in vivo CD 8 + T-cell effector functions in skin and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation models was examined. In the C 57 BL/ 6 anti-bm 1 skin allograft rejection model, across an MHC class I barrier, a single injection of 1109 at the time of transplantation significantly prolonged graft survival. Moreover, 1109 administered at the time of transplantation in the multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-disparate B 10. BR→CBA GVHD model significantly prolonged the survival of lethally irradiated mice that underwent transplantation with donor bone marrow cells and CD 8 + T cells. Histopathologic analysis confirmed that mice treated with the synthetic peptide exhibited diminution of epithelial target cell injury. Specificity of the peptide effect was evidenced by draining lymph node cells from B 10. BR mice that had been challenged with CBA lymphocytes and simultaneously treated with 1109. These cells could not generate secondary proliferative responses in vitro upon stimulation with CBA splenocytes but could respond to third-party C 57 BL/ 6 stimulation.

40|$|In fully HLA-matched {{allogeneic}} {{hematopoietic cell}} transplantation (HCT), the main {{mechanism of the}} beneficial graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect and of detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) {{is believed to be}} caused by donor cytotoxic T cells directed against disparate <b>recipient</b> <b>minor</b> histocompatibility antigens (miHAs). The most common origin of disparate miHAs is nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) differences between donors and patients. To date, only some 30 miHAs have been identified and registered, but considering the many different HLA types in the human population, as well as all the possible nsSNP differences between any 2 individuals, it is likely that many miHAs have yet to be discovered. The objective of the current study was to predict novel HLA-A– and HLA-B–restricted miHAs in a cohort of patients treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning allogeneic HCT (matched related donor, n = 70; matched unrelated donor, n = 56) for a hematologic malignancy. Initially, the cohort was genotyped for 53 nsSNPs in 11 known miHA source proteins. Twenty-three nsSNPs within 6 miHA source proteins showed variation in the graft-versus-host (GVH) direction. No correlation between the number of disparate nsSNPs and clinical outcome was seen. Next, miHAs in the GVH direction were predicted for each patient–donor pair. Using the NetMHCpan predictor, we identified peptides encompassing an nsSNP variant uniquely expressed by the patient and with predicted binding to any of the HLA-A or -B molecules expressed by the patient and donor. Patients with more than the median of 3 predicted miHAs had a significantly lower 5 -year overall survival (42 % vs 70 %, P =. 0060; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2. 6, P =. 0047) and significantly higher treatment-related mortality (39 % vs 10 %, P =. 0094; adjusted HR, 4. 6, P =. 0038). No association between the number of predicted miHAs and any other clinical outcome parameters was observed. Collectively, our data suggest that the clinical outcome of HCT is affected not by disparate nsSNPs per se, but rather by the HLA-restricted presentation and recognition of peptides encompassing these. Our data also suggest that 6 of the 11 proteins included in the current study could contain more miHAs yet to be identified, and that the presence of multiple miHAs confers a higher risk of mortality after nonmyeloablative conditioning HCT. Furthermore, our data suggest a possible role for in silico based miHA predictions in donor selection as well as in selecting candidate miHAs for further evaluation in in vitro and in vivo experiments...|$|R
