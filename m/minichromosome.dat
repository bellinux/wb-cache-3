This suggests that the primary role of the pre-replication complex is to correctly load the Mcm proteins.|$|E
40|$|After {{treatment}} of SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> with DNA topoisomerase I, the superhelicity in {{the bulk of}} the DNA extracted from <b>minichromosomes</b> is known to remain unchanged. However, we found that the DNA extracted from a small fraction of SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> (2 - 5 %), was almost completely relaxed, and covalently closed as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis. Thus, the DNA in these 2 - 5 % of SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> was probably torsionally strained (TS). The proportion of such TS <b>minichromosomes</b> is close to the estimated proportion of transcriptionally active <b>minichromosomes.</b> The distribution of the TS <b>minichromosomes</b> in sucrose gradient coincided with the distribution of transcriptionally active complexes. Both sedimented faster than the majority of <b>minichromosomes.</b> Furthermore, after treatment with topoisomerase I the relaxed <b>minichromosomes</b> could be quantitatively separated from the bulk of material by recentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. A major part of the endogenous RNA polymerase activity was recovered in the relaxed fraction. These data suggest that TS-minichromosomes correspond to transcriptionally active chromatin.

Trypsinized <b>minichromosomes</b> replicate more efficiently than control <b>minichromosomes</b> in in vitro replication assays. The increased template efficiency appears to be due to higher rates of replicative fork movement. In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized <b>minichromosomes</b> do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. This finding suggests that tailless nucleosomes are transferred from the unreplicated prefork stem to replicated DNA branches and excludes a participation of the basic histone domains in nucleosome transfer...|$|R
25|$|The {{formation}} of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) marks the potential sites for the initiation of DNA replication. Consistent with the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance complex encircling double stranded DNA, {{formation of}} the pre-RC {{does not lead to}} the immediate unwinding of origin DNA or the recruitment of DNA polymerases. Instead, the pre-RC that is formed during the G1 of the cell cycle is only activated to unwind the DNA and initiate replication after the cells pass from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The six <b>minichromosome</b> {{maintenance}} {{proteins and}} Cdc45 are essential during initiation and elongation {{for the movement}} of replication forks and for unwinding of the DNA. GINS are essential for the interaction of Mcm and Cdc45 at the origins of replication during initiation and then at DNA replication forks as the replisome progresses. The GINS complex is composed of four small proteins Sld5 (Cdc105), Psf1 (Cdc101), Psf2 (Cdc102) and Psf3 (Cdc103), GINS represents 'go, ichi, ni, san' which means '5, 1, 2, 3' in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Association of {{the origin}} {{recognition}} complex (ORC) with a replication origin is required to recruit both cell division cycle 6 protein (Cdc6) and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 protein (Cdt1), which initiate the assembly of the pre-RC. Both Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins associate with the already bound ORC independently from each other. The ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 together are required for the stable association of the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance (Mcm 2-7) complex proteins with replicative origins during G1 phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effects of}} chromatin structure on template accessibility to replication factors and used three different templates as substrates for simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA replication in vitro: native and salt-treated SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> and protein-free SV 40 DNA. Native <b>minichromosomes</b> contain histone H 1 and numerous nonhistone proteins {{in addition to the}} core histones, whereas salt-treated <b>minichromosomes</b> carry essentially only core histones. We reasoned that the less densely packed salt-treated <b>minichromosomes</b> should be more effective replication templates due to their more extended configuration. However, contrary to this expectation, we found that native <b>minichromosomes</b> replicated with significantly higher efficiency than salt-treated <b>minichromosomes,</b> while protein-free DNA was most active as a replication template. The higher replication efficiency of native <b>minichromosomes</b> was due to two activities bound to the chromatin, which were identified as DNA topoisomerases I and II. By using chromatin substrates of different general configurations, we also showed that the overall chromatin structure determines accessibility to topoisomerases I and II and thereby the efficiency of replicative chain elongation...|$|R

25|$|Various {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are present {{throughout}} the course of the cell cycle that determine whether a cell will progress through division entirely. Importantly in replication the G1, or restriction, checkpoint makes the determination of whether or not initiation of replication will begin or whether the cell will be placed in a resting stage known as G0. Cells in the G0 stage of the cell cycle are prevented from initiating a round of replication because the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance proteins are not expressed. Transition into the S-phase indicates replication has begun.|$|E
25|$|The nuclear {{localization}} of the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance proteins {{is regulated}} in budding yeast cells. The Mcm proteins {{are present in}} the nucleus in G1 stage and S phase of the cell cycle, but are exported to the cytoplasm during the G2 stage and M phase. A complete and intact six subunit Mcm complex is required to enter into the cell nucleus. In S. cerevisiae, nuclear export is promoted by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Mcm proteins that are associated with chromatin are protected from CDK export machinery {{due to the lack of}} accessibility to CDK.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{assembly}} of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to the replication origin. In late mitosis, Cdc6 protein joins the bound ORC followed by the binding of the Cdt1 protein. ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 are all required to load the six protein <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance (Mcm 2-7) complex onto the DNA. The ORC is a six-subunit, Orc1p-6, protein complex that selects the replicative origin sites on DNA for initiation of replication and ORC binding to chromatin is regulated through the cell cycle. Generally, the function and size of the ORC subunits are conserved throughout many eukaryotic genomes with the difference being which ORC unit actually contacts the DNA.|$|E

While Eco RI and Bam HI each cut 22 - 27 % of the SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> under limit-digest conditions, Bgl I, which cuts SV 40 DNA at or very near the origin of replication [4, 5], cleaves 90 - 95 % of the <b>minichromosomes</b> in a preparation. Similar results were obtained with <b>minichromosomes</b> which had been fixed with formaldehyde before endonuclease treatment. One possible interpretation of these findings is that the arrangement of nucleosomes in the compact SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> is nonrandom at least with regard to sequences near the origin of DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|We have reconstituted salt-treated SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> with {{differentially}} phosphorylated {{forms of}} histone H 1 extracted from either G 0 -, S- or M-phase cells.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of chromosome integrity {{is crucial for}} genetic stability. However, programmed chromosome fragmentations are known to occur in many organisms, and in the ciliate Tetrahymena the five germline chromosomes are fragmented into hundreds of <b>minichromosomes</b> during somatic nuclear differentiation. Here, we showed that there are different fates of these <b>minichromosomes</b> after chromosome breakage. Among the 326 somatic <b>minichromosomes</b> identified using genomic data, 50 are selectively eliminated from the mature somatic genome. Interestingly, many and probably most of these <b>minichromosomes</b> are eliminated during the growth period between 6 and 20 doublings right after conjugation.

25|$|In fission yeast and Xenopus, {{chromatin}} {{licensing and}} DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) protein {{is required for}} the licensing of chromatin for DNA replication. Cdt1 is essential for DNA replication and performs its role during the formation of the pre-replicative complex by loading the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance proteins (Mcm) onto the chromosome. Cdt1 has been shown to associate with the C terminus of Cdc6 to cooperatively promote the association of Mcm proteins to the chromatin. Cdt1 activity during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by its association with the protein geminin, which both inhibits Cdt1 activity during S phase in order to prevent re-replication of DNA and prevents it from ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis.|$|E
25|$|Binding of {{the cell}} {{division}} cycle 6 (Cdc6) protein to the origin recognition complex (ORC) is an essential step in the assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. Cdc6 binds to the ORC on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, which induces {{a change in the}} pattern of origin binding that requires Orc10 ATPase. Cdc6 requires ORC in order to associate with chromatin and is in turn required for the <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7) to bind to the chromatin. The ORC-Cdc6 complex forms a ring-shaped structure and is analogous to other ATP-dependent protein machines. The levels and activity of Cdc6 regulate the frequency with which the origins of replication are utilized during the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minichromosome</b> {{maintenance}} proteins {{have been}} found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork. This is consistent with the requirement of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the origin of replication. The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric, doughnut like structure with a central cavity. The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring-like complex is loaded onto the single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an open and a closed ring formation to allow single-stranded DNA loading.|$|E
40|$|The {{template}} {{activities of}} protein-free SV 40 DNA and SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> for DNA re-replication are compared in in vitro replication assays. Density substitution experiments and {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} show that protein-free DNA can replicate {{for at least two}} cycles whereas salt-treated <b>minichromosomes</b> replicate only once. Re-replication of <b>minichromosomes</b> is blocked at the stage of replicative chain elongation suggesting that replicatively assembled chromatin has structural features that prevent a second round of replication...|$|R
40|$|SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> can be {{transcribed}} by prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases.

40|$|The linking {{number of}} DNA in <b>minichromosomes</b> {{increases}} by 2 turns during SV 40 assembly. Changes in temperature also influence the average linking {{number of the}} total intracellular forms of SV 40 DNA. When the isolated <b>minichromosomes</b> assembled in vivo are incubated with topoisomerase I at 33 degrees C in vitro, the linking number of SV 40 DNA decreases. This decrease is about: - 1. 1 turns for <b>minichromosomes</b> with an average nucleosome spacing of 198 base pairs (bp), wt 776; and - 0. 6 turns for <b>minichromosomes</b> containing a shorter average nucleosome repeat (177 bp), tsC 219. The difference between the average linking number of naked SV 40 DNA relaxed with topoI at 33 degrees C and <b>minichromosomes</b> relaxed with the enzyme at the same temperature indicates that SV 40 chromatin contains on the average 26 nucleosomes. However, the results of studies obtained both on DNA flexibility in chromatin and in naked DNA, and on {{the shape of the}} topoisomer distribution curves, indicate that all of the <b>minichromosomes,</b> regardless of their overall structure, do not contain the same number of nucleosomes; this heterogeneity may be as large as 8 nucleosomes.

25|$|For DNA polymerases to function, the {{double-stranded}} DNA helix {{has to be}} unwound {{to expose}} two single-stranded DNA templates for replication. DNA helicases are responsible for unwinding the double-stranded DNA during chromosome replication. Helicases in eukaryotic cells are remarkably complex. The catalytic core of the helicase is composed of six <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance (Mcm2-7) proteins, forming a hexameric ring. Away from DNA, the Mcm2-7 proteins form a single heterohexamer and are loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication as a head-to-head double hexamers around double-stranded DNA. The Mcm proteins are recruited to replication origins then redistributed throughout the genomic DNA during S phase, indicative of their localization to the replication fork.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic {{origins of}} {{replication}} control {{the formation of}} a number of protein complexes that lead to the assembly of two bidirectional DNA replication forks. These events are initiated by the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. This process takes place in the G1 stage of the cell cycle. The pre-RC formation involves the ordered assembly of many replication factors including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, Cdt1 protein, and <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7). Once the pre-RC is formed, activation of the complex is triggered by two kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) that help transition the pre-RC to the initiation complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication. This transition involves the ordered assembly of additional replication factors to unwind the DNA and accumulate the multiple eukaryotic DNA polymerases around the unwound DNA.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} <b>minichromosome</b> {{maintenance}} protein complex helicase activity, the complex also has associated ATPase activity. A mutation {{in any one}} of the six Mcm proteins reduces the conserved ATP binding sites, which indicates that ATP hydrolysis is a coordinated event involving all six subunits of the Mcm complex. Studies have shown that within the Mcm protein complex are specific catalytic pairs of Mcm proteins that function together to coordinate ATP hydrolysis. For example, Mcm3 but not Mcm6 can activate Mcm6 activity. These studies suggest that the structure for the Mcm complex is a hexamer with Mcm3 next to Mcm7, Mcm2 next to Mcm6, and Mcm4 next to Mcm5. Both members of the catalytic pair contribute to the conformation that allows ATP binding and hydrolysis and the mixture of active and inactive subunits create a coordinated ATPase activity that allows the Mcm protein complex to complete ATP binding and hydrolysis as a whole.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} histone deacetylase {{inhibitor}} (HDACi) treatment on SV 40 transcription and replication {{were determined by}} monitoring the levels of early and late expression, the extent of replication, {{and the percentage of}} SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> capable of transcription and replication following treatment with sodium butyrate (NaBu) and trichostatin A (TSA). Results The HDACi treatment was found to maximally stimulate early transcription at early times and late transcription at late times through increased numbers of <b>minichromosomes</b> which carry RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription complexes and increased occupancy of the transcribing <b>minichromosomes</b> by RNAPII. HDACi treatment also partially relieved the normal down-regulation of early transcription by T-antigen seen later in infection. The increased recruitment of transcribing <b>minichromosomes</b> at late times was correlated to a corresponding reduction in SV 40 replication and the percentage of <b>minichromosomes</b> capable of replication. Conclusion These results suggest that histone deacetylation plays a critical role in the regulation of many aspects of an SV 40 lytic infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{nuclear matrix}} plays an {{important}} role in simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA replication in vivo, since functional replication complexes containing large T and replicating SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> are anchored to this structure (R.

In the present study, we have analyzed the course of events leading from nuclear matrix-associated replicating SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> to fully replicated <b>minichromosomes</b> and, further, to their encapsidation into mature SV 40 virions. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that newly replicated SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> accumulated at the nuclear matrix and were directly encapsidated into DNase-resistant SV 40 virions at this nuclear structure. Alternatively, a small fraction of newly replicated <b>minichromosomes</b> left the nuclear matrix to associate with the cellular chromatin.

40|$|A direct {{quantitative}} {{method was}} developed for detecting {{a small fraction of}} <b>minichromosomes</b> active in transcription and for analyzing their chromatin structure. For this, SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> were incubated in vitro in the presence of [alpha- 32 P]UTP to allow elongation of the in vivo pre-initiated nascent RNA and thus labeling of the in vivo transcriptionally active molecules. Subsequently the <b>minichromosomes</b> were treated with Sarkosyl to remove most of the proteins bound to the viral DNA while leaving the 32 P-labeled RNA-DNA-polymerase ternary complexes intact. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, the bulk SV 40 DNA was identified by staining with ethidium bromide and the labeled ternary complexes by autoradiography, although they are not well separated in the gel. When the viral <b>minichromosomes</b> were cleaved with certain restriction enzymes or mildly with DNase I prior to the in vitro labeling and Sarkosyl treatment, analysis by gel electrophoresis showed that all transcriptionally active <b>minichromosomes</b> were cleaved, whereas a large fraction of the bulk <b>minichromosomes</b> was resistant to cleavage. In all molecules the cleavage occurred within the transcriptional regulatory region. In addition, analysis by electron microscopy revealed that SV 40 <b>minichromosomes</b> having a nucleosome-free region (gap) are also more sensitive to the initial cleavage by both DNase I and Bg/I restriction enzyme than non-gapped molecules and that the initial DNase I cleavage occurs within the gap. Thus, at least in SV 40, the nuclease-hypersensitive region is positively correlated with the existence of a gap...|$|R
25|$|During the G1 {{stage of}} the cell cycle, the {{replication}} initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and <b>minichromosome</b> maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G1 stage to the S phase of the cell cycle, S phaseâspecific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork. During this transformation, the pre-RC is disassembled {{with the loss of}} Cdc6, creating the initiation complex. In addition to the binding of the Mcm proteins, cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45) protein is also essential for initiating DNA replication. Studies have shown that Mcm is critical for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and this complex containing both Mcm and Cdc45 is formed {{at the onset of the}} S phase of the cell cycle.
