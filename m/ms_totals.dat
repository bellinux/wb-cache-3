40|$|The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A possibility of dissimilatory MnO 2 reduction at extremely high salt and pH was studied in sediments from hypersaline alkaline lakes in Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia). Experiments with anaerobic sediment slurries demonstrated a relatively rapid reduction of colloidal MnO 2 {{in the presence}} of acetate and formate as electron donor at in situ conditions (i. e., pH 10 and a salt content from 0. 6 to 4 <b>M</b> <b>total</b> Na?). All reduced Mn at these conditions remained in the solid phase. A single, stable enrichment culture was obtained from the slurries consis-tently reducing MnO 2 at pH 10 and 0. 6 <b>M</b> <b>total</b> Na? with formate. A pure culture of a haloalkaliphilic Mn-reducing bacterium obtained from the positive enrichment was phylogenetically closely related to the anaerobic haloal-kaliphilic Bacillus arseniciselenatis isolated from Mono Lake (CA, USA). Bacillus sp. strain AMnr 1 was obligately anaerobic, able to grow either by glucose fermentation, or respiring few nonfermentable substrates by using MnO 2 as the electron acceptor. Optimal growth by dissimilatory MnO 2 reduction was achieved with glycerol as electron donor at pH 9. 5 – 10 and salt content between 0. 4 and 0. 8 <b>M</b> <b>total</b> Na?...|$|R
