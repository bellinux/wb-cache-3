40|$|The paper {{provided}} {{analyses of}} an emerging lane-by-lane detection scheme at signalized intersections. Unlike the current single-channel detection where all the detectors across all the lanes on a particular approach {{are connected to the}} same signal phase, the lane-by-lane detection monitors the headways/gaps on a lane-by-lane basis. Lane-by-lane detection is expected to provide more efficient detection by gapping out the phase when the vehicle queues have discharged, thus can improve the efficiency of traffic signal operations. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} lane-by-lane detection schemes, a traffic simulation model was developed in VISSIM to simulate lane-by-lane detection. Several scenarios were analyzed that included different factors such as traffic volume, maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>headway,</b> and number of lanes. The Vehicle Actuated Programming module within VISSIM was used to code the signal control logic for both the lane-by-lane detection scheme and the traditional single-channel detection scheme. The measures of effectiveness used in the evaluation included vehicle delays and the percentage of cycles when the actuated phases reached maximum. Results from extensive simulation runs indicated that lane-by-lane detection was more efficient than single-channel detection under moderate traffic volumes. For analysis on maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>headway</b> (MAH), the average delay improvement using a 2. 5 -second MAH was similar to the 3. 0 -second result. Lane-by-lane detection was also more efficient when more lanes existed on an intersection approach...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHumanoid robots are {{commonly}} {{required to make}} contacts with the environment in order to perform various tasks. For tasks such as walking, sudden establishment and breaking of contacts are unavoidable. Such behaviours may result in large changes in actuator torques (lashing), leading to potential control instability and damage to the actuators. In this paper, an approach to minimise sudden changes in actuation torques is proposed. This is achieved using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to modify the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> forces for a reactive whole-body controller. The MPC previews the evolution of contacts in time and generates smoother maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> forces. The effect of the proposed approach is simulated for different scenarios on the iCub robot, such as standing up from a sitting posture and the lifting and lowering of a foot while standing.

40|$|Coding schemes {{have been}} {{designed}} and investigated specifically for optical and electronic data-communication channels in which information is conveyed via pulse-position modulation (PPM) subject to dead-time constraints. These schemes involve the use of error-correcting codes concatenated with codes denoted constrained codes. These codes are decoded using an interactive method. In pulse-position modulation, time is partitioned into frames of Mslots of equal duration. Each frame contains one pulsed slot (all others are non-pulsed). For a given channel, the dead-time constraints are defined as a maximum and a <b>minimum</b> on the <b>allowable</b> time between pulses. For example, if a Q-switched laser is used to transmit the pulses, then the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> dead time is {{the time needed to}} recharge the laser for the next pulse. In the case of bits recorded on a magnetic medium, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> time between pulses depends on the recording/playback speed and the minimum distance between pulses needed to prevent interference between adjacent bits during readout. The maximum allowable dead time for a given channel is the maximum time for which it is possible to satisfy the requirement to synchronize slots. In mathematical shorthand, the dead-time constraints for a given channel are represented by the pair of integers (d,k), where d is the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> number of zeroes between ones and k is the maximum allowable number of zeroes between ones. A system of the type to which the present schemes apply is represented by a binary- input, real-valued-output channel model illustrated in the figure. At the transmitting end, information bits are first encoded by use of an error-correcting code, then further encoded by use of a constrained code. Several constrained codes for channels subject to constraints of (d,infinity) have been investigated theoretically and computationally. The baseline codes chosen for purposes of comparison were simple PPM codes characterized by M-slot PPM frames separated by d-slot dead times...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 20 - 22, 1997, Athens, Georgia. Many {{species of}} fish have {{suffered}} detrimental impacts due to the construction and operation of reservoirs. Life-scientists have utilized three basic methods to attempt to include the needs of riverine ecology {{in the formulation of}} reservoir operation policies. (1) Beginning in the 1970 's, discharge-based methods used heuristics to determine <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> streamfiows to protect riverine life. (2) Habitat-based models were developed after the shortcomings of <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> streamflow recommendations were realized and as greater knowledge of fish biology and ecology was gained. These models used hydraulic modeling and species- and lifestage-specific habitat preferences to determine quantity and quality of habitat as a function of streamflow. (3) Individual-based models have emerged in the 1990 's as further understanding of fish life-processes has accumulated these models track the daily actions and movements of individual organisms. The State of Georgia currently uses a variety of discharge-based methods to determine <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> strearnflows. The opportunity now exists to utilize many new technologies to integrate ecological and other "traditional" objectives in a real-time, operational decision support system. The principal technologies to be exploited include the ELQG algorithm individual-based models, computational fluid dynamics, and geographic information systems. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

30|$|In several {{instances}} the lower bound is set as the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> mud pressure to counterbalance compressive stresses {{that lead to}} compressive/shear failure of the wellbore; this {{is referred to as}} well breakout. For permeable formations, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> mud pressure should also prevent an inflow of the reservoir fluid. For this to be achieved, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> mud pressure must be greater than the formation pore pressure. At the opposite end, the maximum allowable mud pressure is defined as the highest magnitude of mud weight that can be applied without causing tensile failure, loss in circulation or hydraulic fracturing of the formation (Hilgedick 2012; Moos et al. 2003). The above conditions are likely to apply where the pore pressure gradient is low or normal such that a considerably low mud pressure is sufficient to restrict the influx of reservoir fluids. A low or normal pore pressure gradient also invariably suggests that the pore fluid velocity at the vicinity of the wellbore face is low. If the pore pressure gradient is steep, the associated pore fluid velocity near the wellbore will be high. Sufficiently high pore pressures can generate effective tensile stresses causing tensile failure where the rock strength is exceeded. This has been observed by French et al. (2012) and Secor (1965), where natural hydraulic fractures and dilation are reported to occur when the pore pressure surpasses the least in situ compressive stress by a magnitude equivalent to the rock tensile strength. Dilation and fracture were also shown to take place in response to a high strain rate. Likewise, high pore fluid velocities create tensile stresses that may cause tensile failure if the rock tensile strength is exceeded. Where there is a decline in permeability or at very high flow rates, the increased drag forces cause the effective radial stresses to become negative, leading to tensile failure (Eshiet and Sheng 2013; Morita et al. 1998; Nouri et al. 2002).|$|R
