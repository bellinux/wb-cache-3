5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in <b>March</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in <b>March</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E

5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Borneo, {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western side of Borneo. This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E

5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> all-time record {{early in the}} 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
5|$|Carey also {{requested}} that the Sounders have their own marching band, {{the first of its}} kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The <b>March</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Match, in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the Sound Wave.|$|E
5|$|Coordinating with Lon Nol ARVN forces {{attacked}} the PRG headquarter complexes. Moving {{across the border}} in Cambodia on 30 March elements of the PRG and NLF were surrounded in their bunkers by South Vietnamese forces flown in by helicopter. Surrounded they awaited till nightfall and then with security provided by the NLF 7th division they broke out of the encirclement and fled north to unite with the COSVN in the Cambodian Kratie province in what would {{come to be known as}} Escape of the Provisional Revolutionary Government. Trương Như Tảng was the Minister of Justice in the PRG and he recounts that during the <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern bases was day after day of forced marches broken up by B-52 bombing raids. Just before the column crossed route 7 on their way north they received word that on 3 April the 9thDivision had fought and won a battle near the city of Krek, Cambodia against ARVN forces.|$|E

5|$|During the Duke's <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Danube Emperor LeopoldI {{offered to}} make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire {{in the small}} principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were {{for the security of}} their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its first}} two years, the 70th Indiana {{performed}} reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1864, Harrison and his regiment joined William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign {{and moved to the}} front lines. On January 2, 1864, Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the XX Corps. He commanded the brigade at the battles of Resaca, Cassville, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain, Marietta, Peachtree Creek and Atlanta. When Sherman's main force began its <b>March</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea, Harrison's brigade was transferred to the District of Etowah and participated in the Battle of Nashville.|$|E
5|$|General-in-Chief He Jin (d.189 AD), {{half-brother}} to Empress He (d. 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d.202 AD) {{to overthrow}} the eunuchs by having several generals <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (何苗) rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d.199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r.189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189–220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.|$|E

5|$|Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led {{a palace}} coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin {{represented}} his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops {{in front of}} the Winter Palace before their <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. After the coup Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of her was well received.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea from 29 until 31 May which ended without combat. The ship covered a minelaying {{operation}} on 11–12 September off Texel. Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23–24 October. Grosser Kurfürst ended the year with a two-week training cruise in the Baltic, which lasted from 5 to 20 December. Another round of exercises in the Baltic followed on 18–23 January 1916. Grosser Kurfürst went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance on 12 February. Work lasted until 3 March; two days later the ship sailed for a sweep into the Hoofden, though this again failed to encounter any British forces. The fleet conducted another sortie on 23 <b>March</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Amrun Bank, followed by another a month later to Horns Reef on 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a <b>march</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
