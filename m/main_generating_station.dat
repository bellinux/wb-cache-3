40|$|Abstract: This study {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of lightning strokes and their effects on power network in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. The network consists of <b>main</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations,</b> substations and the power transmission lines. The transient performance of the system has been investigated using the EMTP (Electro Magnetic Transient Program). Some surges {{were introduced to the}} network as in the form of lightning strokes. The power system responses to such surges were monitored and the results were recorded for studies and more analysis. These results reflect the behavior of the network under such sever conditions, in which the weak point of the system can be discovered. Then some protection devices have been suggested to maintain the continuity of the supply and power delivery. The paper also contains analytical study of the obtained results, which helps in suggesting certain solutions to avoid excessive high over-voltages in the mentioned power network...|$|R

50|$|The Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) {{built their}} first power station at Pandon Dene in 1890. As {{electricity}} demand grew they moved their <b>main</b> <b>generating</b> site to Neptune Bank, near Wallsend in 1901.

The new station was built on a 15 acre site with frontage to the River Tyne. The Carville station was built so as to be available for very large extensions. It was opened in 1904, and at the time was the largest power station in the United Kingdom.|$|R
