5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> than animal species, and {{the resulting}} hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E
5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E

The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s, Buford's economy was {{centered}} on both its location as a railway stop and its leather industry, until demand for leather declined and other transportation options became <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available {{over the course}} of the 1900s, and these industries were no longer a viable part of Buford's economy by the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear acetyl protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups are removed <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> {{than the standard}} protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing these groups are less stable when stored in solution.|$|E

The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The <b>more</b> acetone <b>readily</b> available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, {{were not}} a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot {{population}} when it was <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> self-maintaining, but {{as a result of the}} fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor.

5|$|Excluding {{insects and}} other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have {{established}} themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 {{species of fish}} have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of spore release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

The following year, she became chief operating officer of the Foundation. The Foundation reorganized in 2006, naming Mathews president of the Foundation's Global Development Program. Mathews was involved in awarding grants to improve health outcomes in the developing world, including stopping the spread of HIV and other diseases and making contraception <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> than wrought iron, but {{is cheaper}} and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with {{small amounts of}} manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
50|$|MEL {{is often}} criticized for {{its lack of}} {{programming}} features, and object orientation. In practice, however, MEL {{is used as a}} metaprogramming language where MEL just instructs Maya's node architecture to solve the problem. Since nodes form the actual computational core of Maya using a <b>more</b> robust <b>readily</b> apparent programming method would be a very inefficient approach. In many ways MEL complements the Maya API, with somewhat clear boundaries between allocated tasks. This makes MEL harder to learn and fully understand.|$|R

5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E

The algorithms are evaluated using workload data obtained from production servers from several applications, showing that energy savings of 20 % or <b>more</b> can <b>readily</b> be achieved, with a small degree of unmet demand and acceptable reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) impact. The implementation of these algorithms in IBM system management software and the possibilities for future work are discussed. 1...|$|R

The metaphor of the villain as a beast, too, is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> excreted by the organism.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
