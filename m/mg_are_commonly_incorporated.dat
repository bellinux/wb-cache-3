Polyimide films <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>incorporated</b> in designs to achieve reproducible molecule alignment in the unbiased state. In this investigation two separate resonator elements are designed and investigated: One is fabricated with polyimide layers and one without. Experimental results obtained with a patch resonator illustrate that about half of the maximum tuning range is achieved without polyimide layers. Since substrates able to sustain a temperature range of 180 - 300 °C are required for the polyimide film curing process, avoiding polyimide enables using even lower heat resistant substrates for various tunable microwave applications and can lead to faster fabrication processes.
