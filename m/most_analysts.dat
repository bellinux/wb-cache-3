Wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who ran the fastest 40-yard dash time at the combine of 4.30seconds, was selected by the Oakland Raiders as the seventh overall pick, far higher than <b>most</b> <b>analysts</b> had anticipated.

5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of Fresno State. <b>Most</b> <b>analysts</b> predicted a resounding victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E

Fans and college football analysts predicted Bowden would continue Clemson's resurgence from a 38 season {{during the year}} before Bowden was hired. Some pointed to Bowden's undefeated season {{in the second year}} after assuming the head coaching job at Tulane University as a sign of what to expect from Clemson. <b>Most</b> <b>analysts,</b> however, anticipated a more moderate improvement over the previous year. In the annual preseason poll of media who covered Atlantic Coast Conference football, Clemson tied for second with Georgia Tech. Both teams were far behind perennial favorite Florida State, however. Nationally, Clemson debuted at No. 17 in the preseason AP Poll and No. 20 in the preseason coaches' poll.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} the NFL draft, lasting six hours, eight minutes. One of the big stories of the draft was the fall of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn. Quinn had been {{projected}} as a potential first overall pick in early mock drafts and had been invited to attend the draft in person, but he wasn't selected until the 22nd pick in the first round by the Cleveland Browns, who acquired the pick in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. Louisiana State University quarterback JaMarcus Russell was selected first overall by the Oakland Raiders after he had replaced Quinn as the projected first selection among <b>most</b> <b>analysts</b> following his performance in the 2007 Sugar Bowl against Quinn and Notre Dame. Russell is considered by many as one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history, and Quinn also had a largely unsuccessful pro career.|$|E

Note that the residual standard deviation alone is insufficient for determining the most appropriate model as {{it will always be}} decreased by adding additional factors. Instead, seven criteria are utilized to define important factors. These seven criteria are not all equally important, nor will they yield identical subsets, in which case a consensus subset or a weighted consensus subset must be extracted. In practice, some of these criteria may not apply in all situations, and some analysts may have additional criteria.

Eyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline on February 27, 2007. Injuries to DiPietro and a distracting stick swinging incident that resulted in Simon's suspension {{for the rest of the}} season provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention. They qualified for the post-season, assisted by a late-season winning steak and a 3–2 shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final regular season game. Despite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the Presidents' Trophy-winning Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
25|$|Although Muslims and Orthodox Christians lived {{together}} in Ethiopia for many centuries, complete religious freedom was formalized only in 1991. Many of the pre-existing issues – {{dominance of the}} state religion to 1974, seizure of the church properties by the Mengistu regime, 1974–91, state-sponsored persecution of non-Orthodox Christians, second-class citizenship accorded to Ethiopian Muslims, landownership problems and similar issues for non-Orthodox believers – have subsided for the most part. There are currently between 12 and 15 million Protestant Christians, {{as well as other}} new non-Orthodox Christians. Clashes have been very rare with the domination of the Orthodox. <b>Most</b> <b>analysts</b> say that since such equality and full religious freedom didn't exist before, the infrequent clashes might occur until the culture of tolerance grows between all old and new religions and denominations.|$|E

According to the contract, the gas was sold not directly to Naftogaz, but to RosUkrEnergo, who paid $230 per 1,000cubic metres. After mixing it with two thirds of cheaper supplies from Central Asia RosUkrEnergo resold it to Ukraine at a price of $95 per 1,000cubic metres. The parties also agreed to raise the transit tariff from US$1.09 to US$1.60 per 1,000cubic meters per 100km. This price also held for transit of Turkmen gas through Russia to Ukraine.

Joel Erickson of The Birmingham News {{was one of the few}} writers to pick Auburn, predicting a score of 31–28. Similar predictions were shared during ESPN's College GameDay, which was broadcast live from outside Jordan–Hare Stadium prior to the game.

In 1993, the company created a chain of four closeout stores called Smarts for liquidating clearance merchandise, which was shuttered in 1996. In 1995, the first SuperTarget hypermarket opened in Omaha, Nebraska and the Target Guest Card, the discount retail industry's first store credit card, was launched. J. C. Penney offered to buy out Dayton-Hudson for $6.82 billion in 1996, an offer that <b>most</b> <b>analysts</b> had considered as insufficiently valuing the company. Target remained the company's main area of growth while the department store subsidiaries underperformed. The middle scale Mervyn's department store chain consisted of 300 units in 16 states, while the upscale department stores division operated 26 Marshall Field's, 22 Hudson's, and 19 Dayton's stores. In an effort to turn the departments around, Mervyn's and Marshall Field's closed several locations.|$|E

50|$|This {{source of}} revenue is a {{significant}} component of the business models of <b>most</b> <b>analyst</b> firms. Individual analysts and teams conduct research on industry segments where a vendor may provide products or services, and that same individual or group may provide research deliverables or advisory services to a vendor serving that segment. The analyst is then expected to provide independent objective advice to buyers of those products and services. This matrix of relationships presents opportunities where conflicts can arise. This is exacerbated by the training many vendor analyst relations professionals receive, where they are advised to focus spending on analysts that have the most ability to influence purchases {{of goods and services}} by clients, and to bypass controls analyst firms may have in place to preserve that objectivity by limiting direct access to certain analysts for non-research purposes.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{close calls}} against Stanford and California, the Trojans {{finished}} {{the regular season}} undefeated {{and headed for the}} 2004 BCS Championship Game at the Orange Bowl. USC was the second team in NCAA football history to have gone wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason since the AP began releasing preseason rankings); the first was Florida State in 1999 (two other schools went wire-to-wire before the existence of preseason polls - Notre Dame in 1943 and Army in 1945). Quarterback Leinart won the Heisman Trophy, with running back Bush placing fifth in the vote tally. The Trojans' opponent in the Orange Bowl, Oklahoma, were themselves undefeated and captained by sixth-year quarterback Jason White, who had won the Heisman in 2003; the game marked the first time in NCAA history that two players who had already won the Heisman played against each other. <b>Most</b> <b>analysts</b> expected the game to be close—as USC matched its speed and defense against the Oklahoma running game and skilled offensive line—but the reality proved to be far different.
