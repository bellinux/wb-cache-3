50|$|In 2015, and {{continuing}} into 2016, {{the push for}} a $15/hour <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> among many <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> earners has increased fears among economists that increasing the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely.

In Belgium two hospitals have employed robots as receptionists to offer directions and assist patients, jobs that previously would have been filled by humans.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} a general equilibrium search model with endogenous entry, and therefore zero expected profits, by firms and endogenous labor supply by workers. Positive employment effects from {{an increase in}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> can result as the employment level depends upon both the number of searching firms and the number of searching workers. Welfare implications are similar to the classical analysis: workers who most want the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>jobs</b> are hurt by the increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> with workers who were marginally interested in <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>jobs</b> benefiting. We estimate the model using data on teenagers from the CPS and show that small changes in the employment level are masking large changes in labor supply and labor demand. Teenagers from wealthy, well educated families see their employment probabilities increase as the positive labor supply effects outweigh the negative labor demand effects. In contrast, teenagers from poor, less educated families have lower employment probabilities as they are pushed out of the market by their wealthier counterparts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which people spend careers on <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>jobs.</b> We find that a small but non-trivial number of NLSY {{respondents}} spend 25 %, 50 %, or even 75 % of the first ten years of their career on <b>minimum</b> or near-minimum <b>wage</b> <b>jobs.</b> Workers with these <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> careers tend to be drawn from groups such as women, blacks, and the less-educated that are generally overrepresented in the low-wage population. The results indicate that lifetime incomes of some workers may be supported by a <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> At the same time, these same groups would be disproportionately affected by any minimum wage-induced disemployment. The results suggest that <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> legislation has non-negligible effects on the lifetime opportunities of a significant minority of workers. Minimum wage; Labor supply...|$|R

The Initiative {{required that}} future annual changes in Washington’s <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> be indexed to inflation in the BLS Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).

50|$|High {{operating}} and travel costs, {{the lack of}} TV rights and sponsorship agreements and corresponding lack of funding for salaries and training and development facilities, {{and the lack of}} affiliation with profitable men's professional clubs have all hampered the growth of professional women's leagues in the United States. The NWSL, now the longest-lasting professional women's soccer league in the United States, pays salaries as low as $7,200 per year, an amount that falls beneath every government-recognized poverty line in the United States and is less than an equivalent Federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>job</b> of 40 hours per week. Its highest-paid players who lack a national team affiliation face a maximum cap of $39,700 and teams are held to a salary cap of $278,000, while some players join teams under amateur agreements where the players cannot be paid even if they take the field or start the game. This is far less than the NWSL's predecessors, such as the WPS, where the average salary of $32,000 was almost double the NWSL's maximum average salary of $16,850. It is also poorly competitive with European leagues, which can readily pay salaries to players of the same talent more than $100,000 per year.|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} income {{transfer}} {{systems in the}} US and the UK for low-income families are to reduce poverty and welfare dependency and encourage work. Both the US and UK have made in-work benefits {{a key part of}} their strategy through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) respectively. But although similar in aims, there are significant differences in how the WFTC and EITC are structured and how they work operationally. In both countries, the combination of in-work benefits and welfare benefits produces a theoretical budget constraint with good financial incentives for lone parents to take a <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>job,</b> but poor incentives to increase earnings beyond that. Help with housing costs and childcare costs reduce financial work incentives in both countries. Two further factors make direct comparisons of financial work incentives difficult. First, little is known about take-up rates of in-work and other welfare benefit rates in the US and UK, but recent falls in the numbers of US welfare benefits suggest that take-up rates may vary considerably between and within countries. Second, the differences in assessment and payment mechanisms between the EITC and the WFTC mean that low-income families in the UK and US may respond very differently to apparently similar financial incentives. ...|$|E
