40|$|Urban mining {{offers an}} {{efficient}} supply of resources because of rich mines and low environmental impacts. Location selection and optimization for urban mining facilities {{is more complicated}} than for natural mines, given that it may vary according to the urban population, consumption habits, and economic development. China initiated the National Urban <b>Mining</b> <b>Pilot</b> Bases program in 2010 that targeted 50 national urban <b>mining</b> <b>pilot</b> bases, but unfortunately neglected the location planning issue. Twenty-eight bases have already been selected, which are concentrated in the central and eastern areas of China. This article combines the use of analytic hierarchy process, maximal covering location model, and geographical information systems (GIS) software to optimize locations for China's urban <b>mining</b> <b>pilot</b> bases. Primary findings show that, theoretically, 40 urban <b>mining</b> <b>pilot</b> bases can sufficiently provide maximum gross domestic product (GDP) and population coverage service for China. Taking the current 28 bases as a precondition and 50 bases as the remaining policy target, our second optimization results in a list of 22 cities for the location selection of future urban <b>mining</b> <b>pilot</b> bases. In total, the optimized 22 cities, together with the selected 28 bases, can provide a maximum 97. 5 % of GDP and 95. 1 % of population coverage in China. This study illustrates the optimization process for urban mining recycling facilities in general and provides policy advice for China in a specific case...|$|E

This paper summarises the {{findings}} of the site assessments of ten <b>pilot</b> <b>mine</b> sites involved in a project entitled, Creating a world-leading OHS culture in the NSW Mining Industry which was undertaken for the New South Wales Mine Safety Advisory Council (NSW MSAC). NSW MSAC was established in 1998 in NSW Australia and aims to increase the emphasis on safety and health within the mining industry by reviewing and analyzing safety performance, setting strategic directions, providing advice and developing policy recommendations. The project itself aimed to deliver a self-sustaining method for achieving and monitoring continuous improvement in OHS culture and practice to the NSW <b>mining</b> industry. The <b>pilot</b> sites involved in the project tested a set of self-assessment tools to enable mines to assess and improve their own OHS culture and performance on key elements of an OHS management system.

Both flow loops are equipped with a {{focused beam reflectance measurement}} (FBRM) probe for in situ particle size analysis. These FBRM probes were used to monitor chord length distribution (CLD) during the crystallization process of water-in-oil emulsions into gas hydrate slurries. When water droplets crystallize into hydrate particles, an agglomeration phenomenon is evidenced by pressure drop measurements. This agglomeration phenomenon is also detected by the FBRM probe and is highlighted by a sharp change in the mean chord length and a spread of the CLD to larger chord length. In order to better interpret the chord length distribution measurements, a modelling work has been made. This paper gives a description of the algorithm used for building 3 D fractal aggregates and simulating CLD measurements on them. Aggregates are constructed from a monodisperse spherical particle. The influence of different parameters (fractal dimension, number of particles in the aggregate, diameter of primary particles) on the simulated CLD is also discussed.
