5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the <b>Maison</b> Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the <b>Maison</b> Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E

5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air. The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at <b>Maison</b> Blanche, with {{the remainder of the}} brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in <b>Maison</b> Blanche, <b>Maison</b> Carree and Rouiba. After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army, on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and Béja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain whether they would remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the crossroads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to <b>Maison</b> Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at <b>Maison</b> Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twentyfour hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.|$|E
