5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{writers of}} the book stated four main reasons for creating it. First, that personal experiences provide a valuable way to understand one's own body beyond the <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> experts can provide, creating an empowering learning experience. Second, this kind of learning meant that they were [...] "better prepared to evaluate that institutions {{that are supposed to}} meet our health needs [...] [...] [...]". Third, the historical lack of self-knowledge about the female body [...] "had had one major consequence - pregnancy" [...] and through greater information, women will have more ability to make proactive choices about when to get pregnant. Fourth, information about one's body is perhaps the most essential kind of education, because [...] "bodies are the physical bases from which we move out into the world". Without this basic information, women are alienated from their own body and necessarily on unequal footing with men.|$|R
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> strikes or {{agreements}} not to work, {{entered into}} by laborers to compel employers {{to yield to}} their demands, may restrict the power of such employers {{to compete in the}} market with those not subject to such demands does not bring the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> an {{application}} for compulsory sequestration is brought by a creditor who is prepared to co-operate with the debtor, or who is motivated partly {{by a desire to}} assist the debtor, does not preclude the granting of a sequestration order.

We work in the decomposed four dimensional theory and treat the symmetry breaking effects as a perturbation. Although there is an exact approach, this method is widely used and quite intuitive. We extend existing studies by giving explicit analytical expressions in a covariant Rξ gauge, needed for loop calculations in the decomposed theory. The perturbative approach is also applied to fermions and {{a comparison of the}} gauge boson and fermion spectra with the exact results is presented, validating the perturbative method used in The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has so far resisted every experimental effort to refute its validity.

The defendant must identify the records; explain {{who is in}} charge of the records; address necessity, language, and translation problems; address the volume of such records; address the law governing these records; and rule out the existence of duplicate records in the jurisdiction chosen by the plaintiff. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.|$|E

It is {{important}} to remember that while the first generation DMUs had given many years of service, in very many cases, they suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the trains were clean and new was enough to make them welcome countrywide.|$|E

But if GJ 581g is confirmed by further RV scrutiny, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a habitable planet has been detected this soon, around such a nearby star, suggests that η could well be {{on the order of}} a few tens of percent, and thus that either we have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery.|$|E

25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the U-505 was {{captured}} and towed — rather than sunk after the codebooks {{had been taken}} — was considered to have endangered the Ultra secret. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King, considered court-martialling Captain Gallery. To protect the secret, U-505s crewmen, who knew of the U-boat's capture, were isolated from other prisoners of war; the Red Cross were denied access to them. Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine declared the crew dead and informed the families to that effect. The last of the German crew was not returned until 1947.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} a fair hearing {{requires}} that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E

The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E
50|$|The date of Heracleon is of {{interest}} {{on account of his}} use of St. John's Gospel, which clearly had attained high authority when he wrote. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact,</b> however, <b>that</b> a book was held in equal honour by the Valentinians and the orthodox seems to prove that it must have attained its position before the separation of the Valentinians from the church; and, if so, it is of less importance to determine the exact date of Heracleon. The decade 170-180 may probably be fixed for the centre of his activity. This would not be inconsistent with his having been personally instructed by Valentinus, who continued to teach as late as 160, and would allow time for Heracleon to have gained celebrity before Clement wrote, one of whose references to Heracleon is in what was probably one of his earliest works. He had evidently long passed from the scene when Origen wrote.|$|R

In contrast to the higher number of spindle cells found in the ACC of the gracile bonobos and chimpanzees, the number of fronto-insular spindle cells was far higher in the cortex of robust gorillas (no data for Orangutans was given). An adult human had 82,855 such cells, a gorilla had 16,710, a bonobo had 2,159, and a chimpanzee had a <b>mere</b> 1,808despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> chimpanzees and bonobos are great apes most closely related to humans.|$|R

Despite the legal setback, it was a moral victory which led the local newspapers to disfavor the deportation. Most of the detainees were not tried and were interned {{by the power of}} the emergency regulations, according to which they could be arrested based on <b>mere</b> suspicion, a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> was criticized in the internal British correspondence as well.|$|R
25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's purchasing agent, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746 (1993), that the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the United States reimburses a contractor for payment of state taxes does not violate the legal incidence test.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a {{decision-maker}} is conferred wide discretion by {{law is not}} {{reason enough}} for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v. H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources {{on the ground that}} it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E

On the basis of the case study of Ibn al-Shāṭir, I argue that this function cannot be understood as that of a scientist in the service of Islām, as it has been presented until now. This view on the muwaqqit is based on studies which focus solely on the treatises written by muwaqqits themselves, considering them as <b>mere</b> conveyors of <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> do not need any contextualisation.

25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the object-relational {{impedance}} mismatch, it is often argued by partisans {{on both sides of the}} debate that the other technology ought to be abandoned or reduced in scope. Some database advocates view traditional [...] "procedural" [...] languages as more compatible with an RDBMS than many OO languages; or suggest that a less OO style ought to be used.

On the other hand, many OO advocates argue that more OO-friendly persistence mechanisms, such as OODBMS, ought to be developed and used, and that relational technology ought to be phased out. Of course, it should be pointed out that many (if not most) programmers and DBAs do not hold either of these viewpoints; and view the object-relational impedance mismatch as a <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> of life <b>that</b> information technology has to deal with.|$|R
