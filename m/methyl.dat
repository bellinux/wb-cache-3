5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a <b>methyl</b> group). This <b>methyl</b> group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the <b>methyl</b> clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or histidine base. Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it N-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Here R is a {{hydrocarbon}} {{group and}} Me stands for <b>methyl.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 can be {{synthesised}} from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 in 80% yield. These reactions {{demonstrate that the}} acidity of the <b>methyl</b> hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can be considerably increased {{by the presence of}} the metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a <b>methyl</b> group and the resulting carbanion undergoing nucleophilic substitution with <b>methyl</b> iodide to form a new carbon–carbon bond.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a <b>methyl</b> group). The <b>methyl</b> group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the <b>methyl</b> clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine {{in order to avoid}} such steric clashes.|$|E
5|$|BRCA2 {{contains}} {{a number of}} 39 amino acid repeats that are critical for binding to RAD51 (a key protein in DNA recombinational repair) and resistance to <b>methyl</b> methanesulphonate treatment.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, <b>methyl</b> chavicol (estragole), eugenol and <b>methyl</b> cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or <b>methyl</b> groups carried by folic acid and the <b>methyl</b> group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: <b>methyl</b> and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes <b>methyl</b> (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
5|$|The solvent {{in which}} CS is dissolved, <b>methyl</b> {{isobutyl}} ketone (MIBK), {{is classified as}} harmful by inhalation; irritating to the eyes and respiratory system; and repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{they have}} to be made by {{reacting}} alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete <b>methyl</b> anions and potassium cations.|$|E
5|$|Organotellurium {{compounds}} such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and <b>methyl</b> allyl telluride are {{precursors for}} synthesizing metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.|$|E
5|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to oblong and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum. Three types of hyphae {{are found in the}} flesh of Hydnellum: generative hyphae (thin-walled, not inflated); skeletal hyphae (thick-walled and narrow); and thin-walled gloeoplerous-like hyphae, which stain with <b>methyl</b> blue.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of <b>methyl</b> isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with <b>methyl</b> isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|This {{does not}} appear to be the entire story. Four {{modifications}} to the cytosine residues in human DNA have been reported. These modifications are the addition of <b>methyl</b> (CH3)-, hydroxymethyl (CH2OH)-, formyl (CHO)- and carboxyl (COOH)- groups. These modifications are through to have regulatory functions.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of <b>methyl</b> jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. <b>Methyl</b> jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
25|$|Mixed ethers or {{unsymmetrical}} ethers; e.g., <b>methyl</b> ethyl ether, <b>methyl</b> phenyl ether, etc.|$|E
25|$|To begin with, {{methionine}} can {{be formed}} two ways, either from <b>methyl</b> groups derived from folate, or from <b>methyl</b> groups derived from betaine (which gets its <b>methyl</b> groups from choline). Changes {{in one of}} these pathways is compensated for by the other, and if these pathways do not adequately supply <b>methyl</b> groups to produce methionine, the precursor to methionine, homocysteine, rises.|$|E
25|$|MHC may {{be related}} to mate choice in some human populations, a theory that found support by studies by Ober and colleagues in 1997, as well as by Chaix and colleagues in 2008. However, the latter {{findings}} have been controversial. If it exists, the phenomenon might be mediated by olfaction, as MHC phenotype appears strongly involved in the strength and pleasantness of perceived odour of compounds from sweat. Fatty acid esters—such as <b>methyl</b> undecanoate, <b>methyl</b> decanoate, <b>methyl</b> nonanoate, <b>methyl</b> octanoate, and <b>methyl</b> hexanoate—show strong connection to MHC.|$|E
25|$|Methylation is the {{attachment}} or substitution of a <b>methyl</b> group onto various substrates. The rRNA of humans contain approximately 115 <b>methyl</b> group modifications. The {{majority of these}} are 2'O-ribose-methylations (where the <b>methyl</b> group {{is attached to the}} ribose group).|$|E
25|$|The six alphamethyl {{group and}} the <b>methyl</b> group on the four-carbon {{side-chain}} are derived from the <b>methyl</b> group of methionine.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenolic}} {{group has}} been converted to the <b>methyl</b> ether by treatment of candicine with <b>methyl</b> iodide, to make O-methyl candicine iodide.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of <b>methyl</b> {{parathion}} and azinphos <b>methyl,</b> {{citing the}} risks they pose to children. Both <b>methyl</b> parathion and azinphos <b>methyl</b> are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{transportation}} fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), <b>methyl</b> teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE), ter-amyl <b>methyl</b> ether (TAME), and ter-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Eastman acetic {{anhydride}} process involves {{the conversion of}} <b>methyl</b> acetate to <b>methyl</b> iodide and an acetate salt. Carbonylation of the <b>methyl</b> iodide in turn affords acetyl iodide, which reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product. Rhodium chloride {{in the presence of}} lithium iodide is employed as catalysts. Because {{acetic anhydride}} is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under anhydrous conditions.|$|E
25|$|Brand names {{under which}} {{methyltestosterone}} is or has been marketed {{for medical use}} include Afro, Agovirin, Android, Androral, Mesteron, Metandren, Methitest, Methyltestosterone, <b>Methyl</b> Testosterone, Oraviron, Oreton, Oreton <b>Methyl,</b> Testormon, Testovis, Testred, and Virilon, among others.|$|E
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of <b>methyl</b> derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the <b>methyl</b> alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a <b>methyl</b> ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a <b>methyl</b> ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. <b>Methyl</b> ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} butter which contribute to butter's distinct flavor includes: fatty acids, lactones, <b>methyl</b> ketones, diacetyl and dimethyl sulfide. When foods containing butter are baked, {{the concentrations of}} <b>methyl</b> ketones and lactones increase to provide the flavor of butter.|$|E
25|$|Most {{microbial}} {{cells are}} electrochemically inactive. Electron transfer from microbial cells to the electrode is facilitated by {{mediators such as}} thionine, <b>methyl</b> viologen, <b>methyl</b> blue, humic acid and neutral red. Most available mediators are expensive and toxic.|$|E
25|$|Oxazoles {{containing}} two <b>methyl</b> groups exhibit interesting selectivity patterns. In {{the absence}} of a directing substituent, the <b>methyl</b> group closer to the more electronegative oxygen atom is selectively metalated. However, {{in the presence of a}} directing substituent, the director fully controls the site of lithiation.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} proceeds {{through a}} p-toluic acid intermediate {{which is then}} oxidized to terephthalic acid. In p-toluic acid, deactivation of the <b>methyl</b> by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group makes the <b>methyl</b> one tenth as reactive as the methyls of xylene itself, making the second oxidation significantly more difficult.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyl</b> group, a {{functional}} group related to methane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyl</b> iodide {{had also}} been {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nematicide, and as a soil disinfectant, replacing <b>methyl</b> bromide (also known as bromomethane) (banned under the Montreal Protocol). Manufactured by Arysta LifeScience and sold under the brand name MIDAS, <b>methyl</b> iodide is registered as a pesticide in the U.S., Mexico, Morocco, Japan, Turkey, and New Zealand and registration is pending in Australia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Egypt, Israel, South Africa and other countries. The first commercial applications of MIDAS soil fumigant in California began in Fresno County, in May, 2011.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyl</b> {{isocyanate}} (MIC) is {{an organic}} compound with the molecular formula CH3NCO. Synonyms are isocyanatomethane, <b>methyl</b> carbylamine and MIC. <b>Methyl</b> isocyanate is an intermediate chemical {{in the production}} of carbamate pesticides (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used {{in the production of}} rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is extremely hazardous to human health. It was the principal toxicant involved in the Bhopal disaster, which killed nearly 2,259 people initially and officially 3,787 people in total.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, Me2SO4 is a colourless oily liquid with {{a slight}} onion-like odour (although smelling it would represent significant exposure). Like all strong alkylating agents, Me2SO4 is extremely toxic. Its use as a laboratory reagent has been superseded to some extent by <b>methyl</b> triflate, CF3SO3CH3, the <b>methyl</b> ester of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{generated}} <b>methyl</b> iodide can be distilled {{from the}} reaction mixture.|$|E
25|$|The polymer of <b>methyl</b> acrylate, PMA or poly(methyl acrylate), {{is similar}} to poly(methyl methacrylate), except {{for the lack of}} <b>methyl</b> groups on the {{backbone}} carbon chain. PMA is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than PMMA because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other.|$|E
