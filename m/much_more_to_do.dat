500|$|The {{redesign}} of the obverse {{has led to}} an enduring myth that the breast was covered up out of prudishness, or in response to public outcry. [...] Breen stated that [...] "through their Society for the Suppression of Vice, the guardians of prudery at once began exerting political pressure on the Treasury Department to revoke authorization for these 'immoral' coins". [...] Ron Guth and Jeff Garrett, in their book on US coins by type, aver that the covering up of Liberty was [...] "a change never authorized by MacNeil". [...] Numismatic historian David Lange concedes that {{there is no evidence of}} outcry from the public, but suggests that the decision to change the coin was [...] "more likely prompted by objections from the Treasury Department". Numismatist Ray Young, in his 1979 article in Coins magazine about the quarter, suggested that the redesign [...] "came from the symbolism. [...] If Liberty was going to stand up to her foes, she should do so protected—not 'naked to her enemies.' Thus the war probably had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the change than any alleged 'public indignation.'" ...|$|E

I know how easy it is to see every decision to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with pacing and rhythm in the film itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, this {{public-private}} dichotomy – {{which is}} also a feature of other non-Western cultures, such as the Chinese and Japanese – was better recognised by nineteenth-century Western commentators who then nevertheless proceeded to distort it beyond recognition: in their imagination, women were covered head to toe in public while harems of naked women reclined by indoor pools; the latter image was depicted in many [...] "orientalist" [...] paintings in Europe. These depictions had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with rebellion in the West against the restraints of the Victorian era going back to the sexual paradigm of Christianity, but they nevertheless introduced to Western society a completely false image of Muslim women.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 September 2016, Street {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Conservatives {{to stand in}} the first election for Mayor of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which took place on 4 May 2017. Street said: [...] " [...] will determine how we create wealth here and what type of society the West Midlands will become. I promise to work tirelessly to convince voters that I am the man to lead us through these decisions... Our economy is being renewed but we have <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to ensure everybody feels the benefit. Our mission is therefore to build the economic powerhouse of Britain in an inclusive way. That will need leadership from somebody who has a proven record, can bring people together and can represent us with passion. This election needs to go beyond traditional political loyalties and I look forward to seeking voters' support for the job ahead." [...] The following day, it was confirmed that Street would leave John Lewis at the end of October 2016. He was succeeded by Paula Nickolds, who assumed the role in January 2017.|$|E

6000|$|... "I will if I can, Mallett, though I {{think that}} it will be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{satisfactory}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it out of my savings, except that I shall have the pleasure of knowing that if I were wiped out afterwards you would not be a loser." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is, perhaps, more meaning than we understand, {{when we talk}} of {{the spirit}} in which a thing is done," [...] said her father: [...] "But have you <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Those columns look very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{mean to be}} {{troublesome}} to you,' said she, earnestly; 'I {{shall have}} so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in our own house, that I shall not miss you so much when you are out; besides, we can have Annette to stay with us.' ...|$|E

[...] said Meta, as if {{that were}} very different; [...] "besides, you have so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I am only too glad and {{grateful}} when George will come to me at all. You see I have always been too young to be his companion, or find out what suited him, and now he is so very kind and good-natured to me." ...|$|E

25|$|Because {{of these}} factors and more, fMRI {{evidence}} has been excluded from any form of legal system. The testing is too uncontrolled and unpredictable.

60|$|ERNEST. But, my dear fellow--excuse me for {{interrupting}} you--you {{seem to me to}} be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too far.

6000|$|... "I thought I did. Well, anyway, Steve, {{thanks for}} the suggestion; but, believe me, nothing doing. And now, {{if you feel like}} it, I wish you would resume your celebrated {{imitation}} of a man exulting over {{the fact that he is}} wearing Middleton's Undeniable. There isn't <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and I should like to get through with it to-day, if possible. There, hold that pose. It's exactly right.

60|$|But {{to return}} to our story. Having consented, as above, to his proposal, we had not <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He gave me my writings, and the bond for my {{maintenance}} during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards, that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his will, {{and gave me a}} thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff, plate, &c., which was considerable too.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed away}} {{and left them}} to it. As regards these two, {{everything}} was beyond a question absolutely in order. All Gussie {{had to do was}} keep his head down and not press. Already, I felt, as I legged it back to the house, the happy ending must have begun to function. I mean to say, when you leave a girl and a man, each of whom has admitted in set terms that she and he loves him and her, in close juxtaposition in the twilight, there doesn't seem <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but start pricing fish slices.|$|E
50|$|This {{demonstrates}} that the algorithm is asymmetric in that the encoder has <b>much</b> <b>more</b> work <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than the decoder. This is because the decoder is simply replacing 1's and 0's with the estimated value whereas the encoder is also required to calculate the mean, standard deviation and the two values to use.|$|R
40|$|The flood {{emergency}} is {{far from}} over. It is now crucial that the world supports the millions affected in Pakistan, still in desperate need.

60|$|It is supposed, {{in modern}} times, that these stories {{were pretty much}} all inventions {{on the part of}} the missionaries, or, at least, that the {{accounts}} which they sent were greatly exaggerated and embellished; and there is but little doubt that they had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the authorship of the letters than any khan. Still, however, it is supposed that there was a great prince who at least encouraged the missionaries in their work, and allowed them to preach Christianity in his dominions, and, if so, there is little doubt that Vang Khan was the man.|$|E
6000|$|Old King Friedrich I. had not <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the world, after {{witnessing}} the christening of his Grandson of like name. His leading forth or sending forth of troops, his multiplex negotiations, solemn ceremonials, sad changes of ministry, sometimes transacted [...] "with tears," [...] are mostly ended; the ever-whirling dust-vortex of intrigues, {{of which he}} has been the centre for a five-and-twenty years, is settling down finally towards everlasting rest. No more will Marlborough come and dexterously talk him over,--proud to [...] "serve as cupbearer," [...] on occasion, to so high a King--for new bodies of men to help in the next campaign: we have ceased to be a King worthy of such a cupbearer, and Marlborough's campaigns too are all ended.|$|E
60|$|It was night, almost midnight, {{nevertheless}} {{the sun was}} blazing in the heavens, and as the storm-clouds {{had rolled}} away like a dark curtain, his cheering rays were by that time gilding the icebergs, and rendering the land-cliffs ruddily. The travellers had enjoyed perpetual daylight for several weeks already, and at that high latitude they could count on many more to come. By the time supper was ready, the depressing influences were gone, and the spirits of all had recovered their wonted tone. Indeed {{it was not to}} the discredit of the party that they were so much cast down on that occasion, for the parting, perhaps for ever, from the friends with whom they had hitherto voyaged, had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with their sadness than surrounding circumstances or future trials.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to make composite photographs by overlaying the print with a hand-cut mask, performing an exposure, and then using the inverse of that mask to perform another exposure with a different negative.

6000|$|... "And you can't {{ever tell}} what's in you till you try. Why, when I started this thing, I didn't {{more than half}} {{understand}} my own strength. I wouldn't have said, looking back, that I could have stood {{the wear and tear}} of what I've been through. But I developed as I went along. It's just like exercising your muscles in a gymnasium. You can lift twice or three times as much after you've been in training a month as you could before. And I can see that it's going to be just so with your son. His going through college won't hurt him,--he'll soon slough all that off,--and his bringing up won't; don't be anxious about it. I noticed in the army that some of the fellows that had the most go-ahead were fellows that hadn't ever had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than girls before the war broke out. Your son will get along." ...|$|E
60|$|He wrote as if {{he longed}} to be with those whose toils and sorrows were at an end, but he still had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In 1826, he visited England, partly {{for the sake of}} {{pleading}} with the Society at home, first begun on so small a scale by Carey, but which now numbered many members and disposed of large sums. The committee, however, were often hard to deal with. There were among them many men of good intentions, but without breadth of views, and used to small economies. They listened to false reports, censured without sufficient information, pinched their missions, and dictated the management, so that to deal with them was but a vexation of spirit. Indeed, such annoyances are inseparable from the very fact of the supplies and the government being {{in the hands of a}} body at a distance from the scene of action, and destitute of personal experience of the needs.|$|E
60|$|The house itself, or the “ lastly,” was of stone: large, square, and {{far from}} uncomfortable. These were four requisites, on which Marmaduke had insisted {{with a little more}} than his {{ordinary}} pertinacity. But everything else was peaceably assigned to Richard and his associate. These worthies found the material a little too solid for the tools of their workmen, which, in General, were employed on a substance no harder than the white pine of the adjacent mountains, a wood so proverbially soft that it is commonly chosen by the hunters for pillows. But for this awkward dilemma, it is probable that the ambitious tastes of our two architects would have left us <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the way of description. Driven from the faces of the house by the obduracy of the material, they took refuge in the porch and on the roof. The former, it was decided, should be severely classical, and the latter a rare specimen of the merits of the Composite order.|$|E
30|$|Taken together, Tables  3 and 9 and Fig.  2 b {{suggest that}} many {{individuals}} who are self-employed are doing so voluntarily.
