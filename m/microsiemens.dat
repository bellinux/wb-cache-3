50|$|There is a {{relationship}} between emotional arousal and sympathetic activity, although the electrical change alone does not identify which specific emotion is being elicited. These autonomic sympathetic changes alter sweat and blood flow, which in turn affects GSR and GSP. The amount of sweat glands varies across the human body, being highest in hand and foot regions (200-600 sweat glands per cm2).

Cotyledon-stage seedlings showed a 100% mortality rate when exposed to the following conditions: relative humidity constantly over 90%, water droplets present on the leaves, soil conductivity over 45 <b>microsiemens,</b> and soil pH above 6. However, several plants grew well in a substrate consisting of 50% perlite, 30% Sphagnum moss, 10% peat moss chunks, and 10% fir bark. A top dressing of live Sphagnum was found to provide a good anchoring point for developing roots. Humidity levels of 65 to 85% appeared to be optimal, although more mature plants over 1 year old were able to tolerate exposure to relative humidity in the range of 90 to 99% for up to three days. The highest growth rate was exhibited by plants that experienced warm days, with temperatures of 21 to 29 C, and cool nights, with temperatures of 13 to 16 C. The seedlings grew very slowly during the first 8 months, but their growth rate increased significantly after they reached approximately 2 cm in diameter. The plants were grown under High Pressure Sodium lamps. Optimal light intensity seemed to be in the region of 7500-9100 lx (700-850 fc). Soil with a pH of 4.8 to 5.4 and conductivity of less than 24 <b>microsiemens</b> produced the best results. Dried fruit fly larvae of the species Drosophila melanogaster were fed to the plants once their pitchers reached around 3 mm in height.

Nepenthes burbidgeae {{was found to be}} tolerant of a fairly wide range of conditions, particularly in terms of temperature and soil composition; it grew in every substrate used in the experiment. However, plants showed stunted growth when grown in a mixture consisting of 50% silica gel, 20% Sphagnum moss, 20% fir bark, and 10% peat moss chunks. The highest growth rates were exhibited by specimens in 50% leached perlite, 30% long fiber Sphagnum moss, 10% peat moss chunks, and 10% fir bark, as well as media without fir bark and with a higher percentage of Sphagnum. Nepenthes burbidgeae was found to tolerate temperatures in the range of 9 to 41 °C (48° to 105 °F). A nighttime drop in temperature below 18 °C (65 °F) was necessary for good growth; plants that were not exposed to such a drop grew around 50% slower and produced fewer pitchers. Optimal growth rates were observed with daytime temperatures of 20 to 29 °C (68° to 85 °F) and nighttime temperatures of 12 to 16 °C (54° to 60 °F). Soil with a pH of 4.8 to 5.5 produced the best results; values below 3.5 corresponded with slower growth. Optimal soil conductivity was between 10 and 24 <b>microsiemens,</b> and prolonged exposure of one week or more to levels of more than 60 <b>microsiemens</b> resulted in foliar burn. The experiments suggested that N. burbidgeae grows best when relative humidity is in the range of 68 to 95%. However, constant exposure to high humidity in excess of 90% resulted in disease outbreaks and increased plant death rates. Seedlings of less than one year proved to be particularly vulnerable to this. Optimal light levels varied depending on the light source used: 8100-11000 lx (750-1000 fc) in sunlight, 7000-9700 lx (650-900 fc) under high pressure sodium lamps, 6500-9100 lx (600-850 fc) under metal halide lamps, and 5400-7300 lx (500-680 fc) under fluorescent lamps. Nepenthes burbidgeae could be grown in lower light conditions, but such plants exhibited [...] growth and reduced colouration. The species was found to respond well to a fertilizer that was applied to the pitchers on a monthly basis, but a foliar feed using the same solution produced no visible change in growth rate.|$|E
50|$|An electrodermograph (EDG) {{measures}} skin {{electrical activity}} directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (skin resistance) using electrodes {{placed over the}} digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase eccrine sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electric current. In skin conductance, an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in <b>microsiemens</b> (millionths of a siemens). In skin potential, a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In skin resistance, also called galvanic skin response (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2009 Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) {{is present}} {{throughout}} much of the Yukon River drainage in Alaska, but only five spawning areas have been identified. Spawning habitat requirements are therefore thought to be very specific; however, the physical qualities of these habitats have only been characterized in general terms. The Sulukna River is one of five identified inconnu spawning areas within the Yukon River drainage. A systematic sampling design was used in September and October of 2007 - 2008 to define Sulukna River spawning locations. Presence of inconnu was identified using hook and line sampling methods and spawning was verified by catching broadcast eggs in plankton nets. Small-scale, large-scale, and chemical habitat variables were sampled at transects located every 1. 8 river kilometer (rkm). Project results indicate that spawning habitat was confined to a narrow reach of approximately 20 rkm.

40|$|Background: In view of {{conflicting}} neuroimaging results regarding autonomic-specific activity within the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC), we investigated autonomic responses to direct brain stimulation during sterecitactic limbic surgery. Methods: Skin conductance activity and accelerative heart rate responses to multi-voltage stimulation of the ACC (n = 7) and paralimbic subcauclate (n = 5) regions were recorded during bilateral anterior cingulotomy and bilateral subcauclate tractotomy (in patients that had previously received an adequate lesion in the ACC), respectively. Results: Stimulations in both groups were accompanied by increased autonomic arousal. Skin conductance activity was significantly increased during ACC stimulations compared with paralimbic targets at 2 V (2. 34 +/-. 68 [score in <b>microSiemens</b> +/- SE] vs.. 34 +/-. 09, p =. 013) and 3 V (3. 52 +/-. 86 vs. 1. 12 +/-. 37, p =. 036), exhibiting a strong ""voltage-response"" relationship between stimulus magnitude and response amplitude (difference from 1 to 3 V = 1. 15 +/-. 90 vs. 3. 52 +/-. 86, p =. 041).

We studied 82 healthy babies whose gestational and postnatal ages ranged from 25 - 42 weeks, and 1 - 73 days. The median skin conductance level (preheel prick) in babies of 40 - 43 weeks' conceptional age was 0. 6 microS (<b>microsiemens)</b> and differed significantly between awake babies (1. 2 microS) {{and those who were}} asleep (0. 5 microS).

40|$|Though not in {{agreement}} with geographical reality, the Colorado River is habitually considered as the Patagonia northern boundary. It crosses an arid region shared among five provincial states from Argentina, a fact {{that has made the}} river into a very important resource with a delicate hydrological and ecological balance. Its salinity is nowadays a decisive factor for its agricultural use, and a strict limit – expressed in electrical conductance- of nearly 1, 8 <b>microsiemens</b> has been fixed by law. In 2003, Río Tinto company bought the operation of a potassium mine located on the left margin of the high Colorado River, near the Andes. Exploitation of the potassium creates a waste problem.

The company suggests waste storage near the mine, in the form of salt piles approximately 40 meters high. The salt storage location is 5 km from the river, 300 meters higher relative to it, and bordered by two big “dry rivers”.

Trimeric channels formed with αFM, a construct with point mutations in both furin cleavage sites (R 178 A/R 204 A), exhibited marked reduction in spontaneous cleavage and an ∼ 10 -fold decrease in amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance as compared with αWT (2. 2 versus 21. 2 <b>microsiemens</b> (μS)). Both αWT and αFM were activated to similar levels by subtilisin cleavage. Channels formed with αFD, a construct that deleted the segment between the two furin sites (Δ 175 – 204), exhibited an intermediate conductance of 13. 2 μS. More importantly, αFD retained {{the ability to be}} activated by subtilisin to 108. 8 ± 20. 9 μS, a level not significantly different from that of subtilisin activated αWT (125. 6 ± 23. 9). Therefore, removal of the tract between the two furin sites is not the main mechanism of channel activation. In these experiments the levels of the cleaved 22 -kDa N-terminal fragment of α was low and did not match those of the C-terminal 65 -kDa fragment. This indicated that cleavage may activate ENaC by the loss of the smaller fragment and the first transmembrane domain. This was confirmed in channels formed with αLD, a construct that extended the deleted sequence of αFD by 17 amino acids (Δ 175 – 221). Channels with αLD were uncleaved, exhibited low baseline activity (4. 1 μS), and were insensitive to subtilisin. Collectively, these data support an alternative hypothesis of ENaC activation by cleavage that may involve the loss of the first transmembrane domain from the channel complex...|$|E

The pore then expands to a terminal stage (T) with a large conductance {{on the order of}} one <b>microSiemens.</b> We have studied how virus strain, HA receptors in the target bilayer membrane, and cytoskeleton affect the time a fusion pore remains in each stage. These intervals are referred to as waiting times. In the quiescent stage, waiting times were very sensitive to the virus strain and presence of gangliosides (HA receptors) in the bilayer. When bilayers contained gangliosides, the waiting times in the Q stage for cells infected with the PR/ 8 / 34 strain of virus were exponentially distributed, whereas waiting times for cells infected with the Japan/ 305 / 57 strain were not so distributed. Without gangliosides, the waiting time distribution for PR/ 8 / 34 infected cells was complex. The waiting times in the R and S stages of pore growth were exponentially distributed under all tested conditions. Within the R stage, we analyzed the kinetics of the flickering pore by fitting the open and closed time distributions with a sum of two exponentials. Neither the open and closed time distributions nor the flickering pore conductance distributions were appreciably affected by virus strain or gangliosides. Colchicine and cytochalasin B increased the flicker rates, without affecting the waiting time in the R stage. We conclude that variations in amino acid sequences of the HAs and the presence of gangliosides as receptors within the target membrane critically affect the kinetics of fusion pore formation, but do not affect subsequent stages...|$|E
40|$|A {{fingerprint}} is {{the contour}} diagram of a variable of interest, e. g., the electrophoretic mobility, as function of pH and pλ, the logarithm of the bulk solution conductivity in <b>microsiemens</b> per centimeter. Two colloidal systems were characterized: a commercially available carboxyl amidine polystyrene latex and an industrial sample of titanium dioxide. Each {{of the systems}} was studied in four electrolyte environments: KCl, NaCl, KNO 3, and NaNO 3. Both systems have pH dependent surface charges which undergo charge reversal. The electrophoretic fingerprints map the electrophoretic mobility in the pH, pλ, domain. The contour line corresponding to zero mobility has been named the line of zero mobility and represents {{the path of the}} isoelectric point through the pH, pλ, domain. The results for both systems reveal that to a first approximation, the electrolytes used can all be modeled as indifferent to the surface. At a higher level of detail, however, there are differences in how each salt interacts with the surface, which manifest themselves most clearly in terms of small variations in the measured line of zero mobility. In addition, all four of the electrophoretic fingerprints for the latex sample showed a strong mobility maximum as a function of conductivity at high pH. The hydrodynamic data showed no evidence of a expandable layer. The mobilities of the latex in NaCl were converted to zeta potentials using both the classical Smoluchowski theory, {{as well as that of}} O 2 ̆ 7 Brien and White, yielding maps of the resulting electrokinetic potentials in the pH, pλ domain. The results suggest that electrophoretic relaxation is the dominant mechanism giving rise to the observed mobility maximum. The industrial titanium dioxide (Degussa P 25) was characterized by electrophoretic fingerprinting. All four electrolytes used were observed to be indifferent to a first approximation, but the line of zero mobility was somewhat different for the sodium salts than for the potassium salts, suggesting an influence of ion size. In addition, surface modification was studied by fingerprinting the mobility of colloidal titanium dioxide in the presence of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results suggest that the slope of the line of zero mobility in the pH, pλ, domain is a sensitive indicator of the extent of specific adsorption present. ...|$|E

This study investigates the presence and activity of naturally occurring radioactive materials contained in produced water which is associated with oil and gas exploration. Specifically the principal radionuclide used to measure NORM was radium. We also measured, where possible, other parameters which may have had an effect on the NORM activity. Produced water samples from two different oil field sites, Fausse Pointe and North Broussard, have been used as test sites for this water analysis study. The overall purpose was to determine the specific, selected parameters associated with the produced waters, which are defined as the waters which are brought to the surface along with oil and natural gas. This study is also a precursor in an attempt to predict the activity of naturally occurring radioactive materials and the other factors which may affect the activity and/or occurrence of NORM in produced water samples. A control site used for comparison, was Lake Kernan on the Southern University Campus. The average reading for the first site, Fausse Point, was pH 6. 39, with the total dissolved solids, and conductivity readings off scale for our system. The radium analysis of the Fausse Point site (avg value of 0. 5291 pCi/mL) indicates a relatively ''hot'' NORM area of activity. This activity indicates a potential, future NORM regulatory problem for this site. The average reading for the second site, North Broussard, was pH 7. 39, with the total dissolved solids, and conductivity readings again being very high. The radium analysis of the North Broussard site (avg. of 0. 4697 pCi/mL) also indicates a relatively ''hot'' NORM area of activity. The average readings for our control site, Lake Kernan, were pH 7. 29, total dissolved solids 62. 5 milligrams per liter and conductivity, 141. 7 <b>microsiemens,</b> respectively. The radium activity of the Lake Kernan site was, as expected, negligible. Metals analysis for each of the sites was also performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} site {{is located in}} Plymouth, Massachusetts, above the Plymouth Carver Aquifer. It is positioned along side State Route 25 which opened {{in the summer of}} 1987 in order to extend Interstate 495 to the Bourne Bridge. Snow/ice removing measures using salt, and an alternate deicing agent, CMA have been practiced since the winter of 1987. The highway runoff is collected into an infiltration basin, allowing salt and CMA to infiltrate the sandy aquifer below. The salt and CMA increase the specific conductivity of the groundwater while, the infiltrated acetate is biodegraded, leading to DO depletion within the aquifer. Once anoxic conditions are reached, any further acetate loaded into the aquifer is degraded anaerobically. The objective of this research was to develop and calibrate, steady state, analytical models of specific conductivity and DO transport through the aquifer. The models feature advection, vertical dispersion and for the dissolved oxygen, first order decay. The vertical dispersivity parameter results would be used in the reactive model because it contributes to the mixing of the plume, therefore accounting for the microbial activity. The data used to calibrate the model included monthly groundwater measurements of specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen collected and analyzed from October 1999 - October 2007. Groundwater quality data were obtained from four clusters of a total of 3 7 monitoring wells that allowed for a more detailed study of the vertical variation of parameters. Other data used in this research included monthly rain data and the Massachusetts Highway Department reports of deicing agent solids applied over seven complete road-deicing seasons. The specific conductivity data calibrate the elevation of the plume bottom, the source concentration C~, and the vertical dispersivity. The bottom elevation decreases with distance from the basin as expected. The result for the second parameter searched in the transport model, C infinity was checked against the expected values based on the average amount of deicing agent applied yearly in the research area section ofSR- 25. If the model is correct and the average C infinity predicted is as much as 1200 <b>microsiemens</b> / cm, then 56 % of the deicing agent material drifted off the highway. The average vertical dispersivity result for all of the well clusters used in this project was 0. 77 m. The first order decay rates results from the reactive transport model, suggest that the decay rate is zero order near the source and first order within time and distance away from the source. This behavior is exhibited in a Michaelis-Menten kinetics model...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) evaluate the effects of seaweed biomass application on soil physical, biological, and chemical properties important for agricultural productivity, maintenance of soil quality, and conservation of soil resources; (2) determine the sweet corn (Zea mays L.) yield obtained by implementing seaweed amendment as a soil fertility management practice; and (3) assess the economic feasibility of seaweed amendment for sustainable agriculture through synthesis of experimental findings and cost-benefit comparison between seaweed application and pre-formulated fertilizer use. ^ Low-dose seaweed (LDS), high-dose seaweed (HDS), and pre-formulated 8 - 1 - 9 (N-P-K) organic fertilizer (PFF) fertilizer treatments were employed in a sweet corn production field experiment from October 2011 to November 2012. Pre-seeding N application rates were 42, 84, and 45 kg total N/ha for LDS, HDS, and PFF, respectively. All fertilizer treatments received side-dress N at a rate of 68 kg total N/ha. Seaweed was collected and applied in November 2011 and May 2012, and was analyzed for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), heavy metal, and nutrient (e. g. K) content. To determine seaweed effects on soil quality, soil properties were assessed prior to seaweed application (October 2011), and repeatedly throughout the 2012 sweet corn growing season. Soil properties were determined using recommended national and regional protocols. To assess the effects of seaweed amendment on crop production, the yield and quality of sweet corn was determined by measurement of yield (hundredweight/ha and bushels/ha), above-ground biomass, average ear weight, and dissolved soluble solids (DSS) content. ^ Seaweed amendment had no significant effects on soil physical properties. In contrast, soil pH decreased and EC and SO 42 - increased significantly as a result of seaweed amendment, and these effects varied in persistence. For instance, in May 2012, pH decreased from 6. 0 to 5. 6, EC increased from 42 to 329 <b>microsiemens</b> (µS) /cm, and SO 4 2 - increased from 1. 4 to 8. 7 ppm between the PFF and HDS fertilizer treatments, respectively, but these values returned to PFF levels {{at the end of the}} growing season. No effects were observed in extractable Ca 2 +, total heavy metals, or total K, Fe, Mn, and Ca. Significant increases in active C in both seaweed treatments were observed in the later part of the growing season, with average active C of 608 mg C/kg dry soil in LDS and HDS in August 2012, compared to 492 mg C/kg dry soil in the PFF fertilizer treatment. In contrast, PMN decreased in seaweed treatments compared to PFF in July 2012. Soil organic matter and earthworm abundance did not differ significantly as a result of seaweed amendment. ^ The average yield (45 hundredweight/ha), above-ground biomass (0. 5 kg dry weight/plant), and DSS (15 °Brix) did not differ among fertilizer treatments, but the average weight of fresh corn ears was significantly greater in the LDS fertilizer treatment (0. 22 kg) compared to the PFF treatment (0. 19 kg). Overall, these results suggest that seaweed amendment as a means of partially replacing total N supply (38 % and 55 % for LDS and HDS, respectively) may be a viable agricultural practice. However, the implementation of this practice must be viewed in light of financial requirements (e. g. labor and transportation) and potential yield enhancement, as well as persistence and magnitude of soil quality changes. A preliminary analysis showed that the additional costs of labor and transportation may not be offset by increases in yield and decreases in fertilizer cost. For improved financial viability of seaweed amendment, these expenses may be reduced by improved coordination of seaweed collection and application. With improvements in collection efficiency and prediction of nutrient supply, seaweed amendment is recommended, primarily due to improvements in soil biological quality (active C) and sweet corn quality (average ear weight).

40|$|Application of seaweed {{to manage}} soil {{fertility}} {{is a traditional}} practice in many coastal regions, utilizing an inexpensive, abundant, and nutrient-rich resource. As a practice that re-purposes waste materials, diversifies inputs, and relies on coastal resources, seaweed amendment may be an effective and inexpensive means of strengthening and supporting agriculture in coastal agroecosystems. Putatively, seaweed biomass may be a useful amendment for crop production and soil quality improvement due to provision of plant nutrients (e. g. N, P, K, Ca), and promotion of microbial activity, among other benefits. However, limitations of seaweed application include high sulfur (S), salt, and heavy metal content. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) evaluate the effects of seaweed biomass application on soil physical, biological, and chemical properties important for agricultural productivity, maintenance of soil quality, and conservation of soil resources; (2) determine the sweet corn (Zea mays L.) yield obtained by implementing seaweed amendment as a soil fertility management practice; and (3) assess the economic feasibility of seaweed amendment for sustainable agriculture through synthesis of experimental findings and cost-benefit comparison between seaweed application and pre-formulated fertilizer use. Low-dose seaweed (LDS), high-dose seaweed (HDS), and pre-formulated 8 - 1 - 9 (N-P-K) organic fertilizer (PFF) fertilizer treatments were employed in a sweet corn production field experiment from October 2011 to November 2012.

To determine seaweed effects on soil quality, soil properties were assessed prior to seaweed application (October 2011), and repeatedly throughout the 2012 sweet corn growing season. Soil properties evaluated were aggregate stability, bulk density, infiltration, available water capacity (AWC), nitrate (NO 3 -), phosphate (PO 43 -), extractable potassium (K+), extractable calcium (Ca 2 +), heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, and As), total K, Fe, Mn, and Ca, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, sulfate (SO 42 -), soil organic matter (SOM), active C, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), and earthworm abundance. Soil properties were determined using recommended national and regional protocols. To assess the effects of seaweed amendment on crop production, the yield and quality of sweet corn was determined by measurement of yield (hundredweight/ha and bushels/ha), above-ground biomass, average ear weight, and dissolved soluble solids (DSS) content. Seaweed amendment had no significant effects on soil physical properties. No significant differences in NO 3 - and PO 43 - were observed in response to seaweed addition. Extractable K+ levels were higher, indicating that primary nutrient provision was equivalent or improved with seaweed addition. In contrast, soil pH decreased and EC and SO 42 - increased significantly as a result of seaweed amendment, and these effects varied in persistence. For instance, in May 2012, pH decreased from 6. 0 to 5. 6, EC increased from 42 to 329 <b>microsiemens</b> (µS) /cm, and SO 42 - increased from 1. 4 to 8. 7 ppm between the PFF and HDS fertilizer treatments, respectively, but these values returned to PFF levels {{at the end of the}} growing season.
