5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer</b> would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer,</b> such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E

However, they also relied heavily on close observation of sea sign and {{a large body of}} knowledge from oral tradition.|$|E

25|$|However, because Arnold's {{balance spring}} patents were in force (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could {{not use the}} helical balance spring until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, {{in the case of}} the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat balance springs only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer,</b> including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.|$|E

25|$|A highly {{important}} breakthrough for {{the accurate}} determination of longitude {{came with the}} invention of the <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer.</b> The 1714 longitude prize offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being in}} the majority, none of the loyalists put up a {{significant}} struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a 23-foot (7m) launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales {{were only a few}} inches above the water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer.</b> Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on Bounty for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|James Reynolds, {{a member}} of the Clan and on the {{committee}} to rescue the prisoners, bought under his name for the Clan a three-masted whaling bark Catalpa for $5,500, and George Anthony recruited twenty-two sailors. On 29 April 1875, Catalpa sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts. At first, most of the crew was unaware of their real mission. Anthony noticed too late that the ship's <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer</b> was broken, so he had to rely on his own skills for navigation. First they sailed to Fayal Island in the Azores, where they off-loaded 210 barrels of sperm whale oil. Unfortunately, much of the crew deserted the ship, and they had to leave three sick men behind. Anthony recruited replacement crew members and set sail for Western Australia.|$|E

500|$|Controversially, {{the ship}} {{did not have}} a <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer</b> on board, a {{comparatively}} new and expensive navigational instrument that would have enabled her to determine her longitude accurately. Instead, she was forced to navigate through the heavy storm and strong currents using older, less reliable navigational aids and dead reckoning. Navigational difficulties and a lack of headway led to an incorrect assumption that Cape Agulhas was Cape Point. Consequently, Arniston was wrecked when her captain headed north for St Helena, operating on [...] the incorrect belief the ship had already passed Cape Point.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Earnshaw's <b>Marine</b> <b>Chronometer</b> No.509 was {{manufactured}} around 1800 {{and served}} {{on a number of}} Royal Navy ships. William Edward Parry while exploring Baffin Bay in July 1819 during his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage mentions that Earnshaw's chronometer had been used in 1818 to determine the longitude of a spot to within [...] of his own measurement. He does not, however, say which ship it was on board. At this early time, all Royal Navy purchased chronometers were issued by the Greenwich Observatory who also checked their rates and sent them out for cleaning between voyages. Initially, Greenwich issued chronometers directly to ships, but later, as chronometers became more common, they were sent from Greenwich to other Royal Navy ports and dockyards for issue locally. The first recorded issue from Greenwich was 3 July 1823 to Captain Frederick Marryat in command of HMS Larne. Larne took part in the First Anglo-Burmese War which lasted from 1824 to 1826.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{bimetallic strip}} {{was made by}} the eighteenth-century clockmaker John Harrison who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer</b> (H3) of 1759 [...] to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the balance spring. It {{should not be confused with}} the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his gridiron pendulum. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison's invention is recognized in the memorial to him in Westminster Abbey, England.|$|E

2500|$|Giovanni Cassini {{published}} {{a much more}} accurate ephemeris table in 1668 using his observations from the previous 16 years. Using this table, Cassini generated a more accurate map of France by observing eclipses of the Jovian satellites at various locations across the country. This showed that previous maps had depicted some shorelines as extending farther than they really did, which caused the apparent area of France to shrink, and led King Louis XIV to comment that [...] "he was losing more territory to his astronomers than to his enemies." [...] Eclipse timings of the Jovian moons {{would continue to be}} used to determine longitude for another hundred years for tasks such as surveying the Mason–Dixon line and geodesy measurements. Efforts were made to utilize this method for marine navigation, but it proved to be impossible to make the necessary observations with sufficient accuracy from the moving deck of a ship; it would not be until the invention of the <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer</b> in the mid-18th century that determining longitude at sea became practical.|$|E

Dickens put his character [...] "Pip", in Great Expectations, in residence at Barnard's Inn opposite, now occupied by Gresham College. Staple Inn, notable as the promotional image for Old Holborn tobacco, is nearby. The three of these were Inns of Chancery. The most northerly of the Inns of Court, Gray's Inn, is off Holborn, as is Lincoln's Inn: the area {{has been associated with}} the legal professions since mediaeval times, {{and the name of the}} local militia (now Territorial Army unit, the Inns of Court & City Yeomanry) still reflects that. Subsequently, the area diversified and become recognisable as the modern street.

2500|$|Gemma Frisius was {{the first}} to propose the use of a {{chronometer}} to determine longitude in 1530. In his book On the Principles of Astronomy and Cosmography (1530), Frisius explains for the first time how to use a very accurate clock to determine longitude. The problem was that in Frisius' day, no clock was sufficiently precise to use his method. In 1761, the British clock-builder John Harrison constructed the first <b>marine</b> <b>chronometer,</b> which allowed the method developed by Frisius. Triangulation had first emerged as an efficient method in cartography (mapmaking) in the mid sixteenth century when Frisius set out the idea in his Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione (Booklet concerning a way of describing places). Dutch scientists Jacob van Deventer and Willebrord Snell were among the firsts to make systematic use of triangulation in modern surveying, the technique whose theory was described by Frisius in his 1533 book. Gerardus Mercator is considered as {{one of the founders of}} modern cartography with his invention of Mercator projection. Mercator {{was the first}} to use the term 'atlas' (in a geographical context) to describe a bound collection of maps through his own collection entitled [...] "Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mvndi et fabricati figvra" [...] (1595). The hypothesis that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>chronometers</b> always {{contain a}} {{maintaining}} power which keeps the chronometer going {{while it is}} being wound, and a power reserve to indicate how long the chronometer will continue to run without being wound. <b>Marine</b> <b>chronometers</b> are the most accurate portable mechanical clocks ever made, achieving a precision of around a 0.1 second per day or less than one minute per year. This is accurate enough to locate a ship's position within 1-2 miles (2-3km) after a month's sea voyage.|$|R
