40|$|Thanks to a bi-disciplinary {{approach}} combining {{discourse analysis}} and literature, this contribution deals with contemporary norms in literary fiction, asking what is established as acceptable by commentators. The objects {{of this study}} are normative <b>metadiscourses</b> produced during the controversies that emerged after the publication of two French novels, namely La carte et le territoire by Michel Houellebecq and Nicolas Jones-Gorlin's Rose Bonbon. The aim of the analysis is to understand whether the normative reactions these two books have generated have linguistic motivations. The normative <b>metadiscourses</b> under analysis, collected in heterogeneous media (the specialized press, mainstream newspapers, social networks dedicated to books, and commercial websites), point towards some specific definitions and values of contemporary literary fiction. While the treatment of the taboo of paedophilia in fiction is debated, the normative prohibition of plagiarism seems to be more context-dependent and to depend on the three instances at stake in the debate (the plagiarist, the plagiarized author and the medium) ...|$|R

We consider Codeswitching {{as one of the}} most relevant observables in multilingual interaction and attempt to analyze how it is used by speakers. After a brief presentation of three theoretical and analytical conceptions of Code-switching in interaction (Auer, Mondada & Myers Scotton), we define Code-switching as an interactional, strategical, multilingual resource exploited by speakers to achieve various interactional and non interactional goals. We then show in two CA-like analysis how multilingual strategical resources occur in the interactional practices of the analyzed working group, and how they are exploited by speakers in order to organize interaction, work, tasks, and to construct one's leadership. We also consider the <b>metadiscourses</b> of the students about their own practices and multilingualism in general, in order to confront them to their actual multilingual practices. We draw the hypothesis that discrepancies observed between <b>metadiscourses</b> and practices can be explained through the development of (meta) discourses showing a unilingual conception in describing multilingual practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to present a {{recently}} built interview corpus called Corpus of Hungarian School Metalanguage – Interview Corpus (CHSM-IC) and its potential in language ideology studies. This corpus was compiled during a broad survey on Hungarian school metalanguage carried out in 2009 and was recently made available for a wider research community within the CESAR (Central and South-East European Resources) project. The study investigates interactional routines used in <b>metadiscourses</b> on language use. Printed texts cited from prestigious handbooks and interview data from CHSM-IC are compared. Thus, widely used, culturally-inherited text fragments are detected and confronted with the interviewees’ narratives on their own communicational experiences. A case study on the discourse marker hát (‘so’, ‘well’) illustrates that there is a conflict and often a controversy between language ideologies disseminated by the Hungarian school system and the linguistic selfrepresentation in the interviewees’ narratives. Combining Language Ideology, Conversation Analysis, Discourse Analysis and Discursive Social Psychology frameworks, the paper presents a detailed description on the emergence of <b>metadiscourses</b> in a school setting. The paper concludes that metalinguistic utterances (e. g., answers on grammaticality, statements on linguistic accuracy, etc.) and observable, spontaneous (or semi-spontaneous) language use patterns are regularly not in accordance with each other...|$|R

I argue that social constructivism, like biological determinism, presumes a ‘split’ world, where subjective lived experiences are separated {{from the world of}} socio-cultural forces. Following a phenomenological approach, grounded in Merleau-Ponty’s ontological view of the body, this article attempts to move beyond the dualistic <b>metadiscourses</b> of social constructivism in maintaining that identity is a fully embodied process. I see gender and sexuality as necessarily embodied and corporeally constituted. In the light of this, I propose an understanding of gender and sexuality that focuses on the centrality of the body as open project. This approach sees gender and sexuality as embodied processes that are enmeshed with the complex fabric of lived everyday experiences and concurrent socio-cultural and historical processes. Drawing on real-life examples, I conclude that gender and sexual embodiment are not one-dimensional according to a binary system of male versus female. Rather, given the documented experience of the indeterminacy and ambiguity of human existence, {{there are a variety of}} possible embodiments of humankind...|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{constructions of}} journalistic {{identity}} {{in a digital}} age has been a lively area of scholarship as the field of digital journalism studies has grown (Franklin 2013, 2014; Steensen and Ahva 2015). Yet despite many approaches to understanding digital change, key avenues for understanding changing constructions of identity remain underexplored. This paper addresses a conceptual void in research literature by employing semiotic and semantic approaches to analyse performances of journalistic identity in narratives of newswork facilitated by and focused on digital megaleaks. It seeks to aid understanding of the way narratives describe changing practices of newsgathering, and how journalists position themselves within these hybrid traditional/digital stories. Findings show news narratives reinforce the primacy of journalists within traditional boundaries of a journalistic field, and articulate a preferred imagination of journalistic identity. Methodologically, this paper shows how semantic and semiotic approaches lend themselves to studying narratives of newswork within journalistic <b>metadiscourses</b> to understand journalistic identity at the nexus of traditional and digital dynamics. The resultant portrait of journalistic identity channels a sociohistoric, romantic notion of the journalist as “the shadowy figure always to {{be found on the}} edges of the century’s great events” (Inglis 2002, xi), updated to accommodate modern, digital dynamics...|$|R

NGOs, ecotourism enterprises, as well as Mexican Government and Biosphere Reserves administrative agencies are remodeling space, setting the scenery for tourism development in order to reconcile visitors with common representations of tropical wilderness. Throughout decades of direct interaction with tourists, Lacandon Mayas have established themselves as actors of the local landscaping process, therefore ruled by two different patterns : - a naturalist model, deeply influenced by the biocultural conservation paradigm. In this framework, the uses of romantic exoticism as an aesthetic category {{are part of a}} conservation strategy for building durable landscapes within a fragile environment; - an indigenous model aimed to enhance the anthropogenic influence on nature, through <b>metadiscourses</b> as a cross between environmental injunctions and group’s territorial claims. This « landscape syncretism » is particularly visible in the « interpretative trails », designed to produce a genuine aesthetic experience for the visitors accompanied by Lacandon guides, who provide an immediate familiarization with the uncanny nature of the forest. Far from a simplistic indigenous/exogenous opposition, this collective process of estranging the domestic space and making the exotic seem familiar in shared landscapes reveals pragmatic and symbolic links between two opposed, though strangely similar conceptions of nature.

The hypothesis that if research groups could incorporate the <b>metadiscourses</b> of knowledge management into the research project, the research process could be improved, better enabling the researchers to comply with the indicators established by Colciencias within the standards of production and quality. Therefore, the objective of this study centers on research groups in which the group investigates how knowledge is generate, utilized, transformed, and transferred both within the groups themselves and beyond. This characteristic confers on them an importance relevant to the generation of value and enrolls them in the logic of the so-called “knowledge economy. ” Therefore, the principal activities are based on the production of intangible resources associated with knowledge. To further advance along these lines of study, the work proceeded with a complex focus, with the design of some instruments appropriate to research-action, as in the case of triangulation. Finally, a series of results, both quantitative and qualitative, was obtained that could confirm the hypothesis, that is, that research groups pass through four stages in the creation knowledge: socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization.

40|$|Teoretski in filozofski diskurz, ki želi odkrivati "resnico", ali bolje Bit, kot je to opredelil Heidegger, se mora zaplesti s pesniškim diskurzom. Po njegovem je samo tako mogoče upati, da bi se lahko vsaj deloma približali temu, kar si besede prizadevajo izraziti in kar ostaja neizrečeno. Hélène Cixous v svojih poetičnih in skrajno inovativnih tekstih poskuša odkriti Knjigo Knjig, kjer bi besede utegnile razkriti skrivnosti bivanja in umiranja. Avtorica, rojena v arabsko-judovskem francoskem okolju kolonialne Alžirije - z nemškimi koreninami po materini strani in pozneje s svojo dovzetnostjo za anglosaksonski svet prek raziskav Joyceve {{literature}} - je bila usodno odprta za hibridnost, ki jo uteleša biološko, genealoško, jezikovno in kulturno. Kot znanstvenica in pisateljica združuje feminizem, filozofijo in psihoanalizo znotraj francoskega akademskega sistema. V svoji zgoščeni in pogostokrat hermetični naraciji, ki se giblje med filozofijo, poetično prozo in gledališčem, Hélène Cixous prek analoškega in metaforičnega mišljenja povezuje različne teoretske pristope v svojevrsten spoj metadiskurzov, ki odkrivajo pomen literature. Theoretical {{and philosophical}} discourse that wishes to find "truth," {{or rather the}} Being such as defined by Heidegger, is bound {{to engage in a}} poetical discourse, in his view the only hope to partially approach that which the words attempt to express and which remains unsaid. In her poetical and highly innovative texts, Hélène Cixous thus attempts to uncover the Book of the Books, where words may reveal the secrets of being and dying.

40|$|Questions of gender, feminism, and écriture {{feminine}} {{in individual}} cases {{continue to be}} given priority in studies of women’s writing in Baroque Spain, {{to the exclusion of}} study of the wealth of original sources that show women participating freely and equally in all aspects of the Republic of Letters, as contemporaries called the literary profession. My doctoral thesis seeks to correct this imbalance by charting the rise and consolidation of the status and image of women as authors in and around the period now recognized as having seen the beginnings of the literary profession, 1600 - 1650. I take as my field the república literaria in the Spanish Atlantic empire in the period 1450 – 1700, with parallels from England, France and Italy. Using Genette’s studies of the paratext (2001) and Darnton’s theory of the “communication circuit” (2006), and building on the work of cultural historians (Bouza 1992, 1997, 2001; Bourdieu 1993; Chartier 1994; Cayuela 1996 & 2005), I examine the role of women as authors and readers, chiefly through an analysis of the discourse of their paratexts in a representative corpus of texts patronized, written, or published by women in Catalan, Portuguese, and Spanish. The key criterion of selection has been the projection of a female voice in public texts, whether via a sobriquet, a real name, grammatical gender, or a pseudonym. However, where appropriate, it has been extended to include also literary correspondence, book inventories, and texts, which despite being published anonymously, {{have been shown to be}} by women. The study is divided into two parts wherein extant sources have been selected and arranged chronologically and by theme, rather than by author. Part I, comprising Chapters 1 and 2, examines the rise and expansion of women’s symbolic capital in the public literary sphere. Part II, comprising Chapters 3 and 4, shows that, by the seventeenth century, women’s literary practices had achieved commercial, professional and didactic renown on both sides of the Atlantic. Chapter 1 shows the rhetorical significance embedded in women’s first <b>metadiscourses,</b> whether in identifiable or anonymous authorship, dating back to the fifteenth century. Chapter 2 illustrates women’s rising literary authority by reviewing their public endeavours and literary self-consciouness in the sixteenth century. Chapter 3 shows the rise of discourses of fame and professionalization in single publications by identifiable female authors, a shift most noticeable in commercial traditions in print (ephemera, the novela and the theatre). Chapter 4 challenges the fallacy that women chose anonymity or hid behind a patron (or publisher) because of their sexual difference. It thus assesses whether the question of women’s literary successes ultimately depended on a negation of their female sex —through publishing anonymously, under a pseudonym, or in the name of a publisher— or was, rather, influenced by their authorial intent, social and religious status. In sum, the thesis shows that women’s sexual difference did not prevent them from gaining a successful and recognized place within the rising Republic of Letters, but was on the contrary turned to their advantage as a promotional point. Women were as important as men as agents in the emergence of the modern concept of the author as independent artist. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in conducting studies investigating different aspects of <b>metadiscourse</b> in relation to language learning. The present study hopes to contribute to the study of <b>metadiscourse</b> by investigating its effect on EFL learners’ reading comprehension (with three levels of reading proficiency: low, medium, and high) when faced two text types –academic and general. To this end, data were collected through two instruments, namely a TOEFL reading comprehension sample test and a reading comprehension test which consisted of two text types was developed for the purpose of this study.
