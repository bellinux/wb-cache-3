50|$|A second smaller {{corridor}} {{which measures}} 1.25 meters in height and 50 cm in width {{can be found}} at the entrance to the bunker cavity. This smaller corridor travels around the outer wall of the bunkers thus creating a <b>moisture</b> <b>trap</b> which is essential as the bunkers are located under the water table for most of the year. This design of bunkers allows the inner concrete walls to stay free from being humid and therefore keeping armaments and ammunition dry.|$|E
50|$|The bag is an {{airtight}} reservoir that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into {{it through a}} blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including Gore-Tex have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag {{is the potential for}} fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of lung infection. An advantage of a synthetic bag is that they have a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective <b>moisture</b> <b>trap</b> {{to the inside of the}} bag.|$|E

50|$|Oxidation of {{the sample}} is {{complete}} after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO2, through a <b>moisture</b> <b>trap</b> and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO2 gas. The HTCO method {{may be useful in}} those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high molecular weight organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of non-volatile residues within the combustion tube. These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because aqueous samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually quartz, furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the salt content {{of the sample}}s do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the combustion tube eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed. To avoid this problem the manufacturing industry has developed several concepts, such as matrix separation, ceramic reactors, better process control or methods without catalysts.|$|E
40|$|Cunningham (2000) and Jotisankasa (2005) {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of tensiometerbased suction control systems. In these systems, wetting and drying of the soil are achieved by water injection and circulation of air {{in contact with the}} specimen while suction is monitored by sample-mounted high suction tensiometers. Unlike the axis translation technique, these systems avoid using elevated air pressures and better reproduce the drying and wetting conditions occurring in the field. Building upon these earlier works, this paper describes an automated tensiometer-based suction control system that enables direct measurement of water content changes inside the sample. A diaphragm pump forces air to flow inside a closed loop that runs across the sample while a <b>moisture</b> <b>trap</b> ensures that the relative humidity of the circulating air is kept low. As the circulating air dries the soil, the amount of abstracted water is measured by continuous weighing of the desiccant inside the <b>moisture</b> <b>trap.</b> Wetting of the sample is instead achieved by controlled injection of water through a solenoid valve connected to a pressurized volume gauge. The changes of soil water content are given by the difference between the amounts of water injected by the volume gauge and that retained by the desiccant. The system is used to impose cycles of drying and wetting on compacted clayey specimens and results from preliminary tests are presented. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an automated tensiometer based suction control system for testing unsaturated soil samples. The system is able to dry and wet soil, while measuring suction (pore water pressure - air pressure) and water content. The system uses air circulation within a closed loop to dry the soil, or water injection to wet the soil, to achieve the required pore water pressure while the air pressure is kept atmospheric. Pore water pressure is controlled by using a feedback computer system that dries or wets soil samples according to measurements obtained from sample-mounted high suction tensiometers. Excess moisture in the air circulation loop is captured by an in-line <b>moisture</b> <b>trap</b> consisting of a sealed cell containing a desiccant (silica gel), which is placed on an electronic balance to give continuous measurements of retained water. Changes of the sample water content are measured as the difference between the amount of water injected and that retained by the <b>moisture</b> <b>trap.</b> The system is fully automated and runs controlled by software with minimum assistance. The proposed suction control system presents advantages over the conventional axis translation technique as it avoids the need for elevated pore air pressures and hence better replicates the natural processes of wetting and drying of soils. The system was developed for use in a triaxial cell, but could also be used with other instruments and for the determination of water retention curves. Copyright © 2011 by ASTM International.

Specifically, refrigerated and frozen food display units area is characterized by cool loads created by commercial cases, which are also <b>moisture</b> <b>trap.</b> A coupling approach of air conditioning with display cases operation is proposed in this paper, based on {{a model of the}} cold aisle phenomenon. In this area, the significant vertical stratification of air has to be considered to calculate electric consumption of display cases. Heat and moisture exchanges are calculated and typical values are given. Our study gives new elements to answer the questions: how the energy balance is affected by the ambiance setpoints, how interactions between display freezers and air conditioning systems can be characterized. Typical technical characteristics of roof-top air conditioners performance under various conditions are proposed to calculate energy consumption including auxiliary equipment (fans). Simulations made with the models for commercial display freezer loads and air temperature profile establish the impacts of different ambient temperature and humidity setpoints. To aggregate the comparison, all energy uses are taken into account: air conditioning, refrigeration and defrosting, it is an essential element for technico-economical analysis of innovative solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|A Tekmar LSC- 2000 Purge and Trap (P&T) {{apparatus}} {{was further}} modified {{in order to}} improve the on-line P&T gas chromatographic etermination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in biological tissue. The standard needle sparger of the Tekmar was replaced by a system consisting of two needles (purge gas in- and outlet) and a <b>moisture</b> <b>trap.</b> This modification allows a rapid throughput of samples and minimizes the risk of contamination or losses. Addition of 1 -octanol proved successful in eliminating the severe sample foaming that generally occurs when biological material is purged. For separation of the analytes a J&W DB-VRX column (60 m, 0. 25 mm i. d., 1. 4 µm film) was used, which allowed the elimination of the cryofocusing step prior to injection. The method was tested for 13 priority VOCs and detection limits were obtained ranging from 0. 003 ng/g (tetrachloromethane) to 0. 16 ng/g (m - and p -xylene) using single ion monitoring-mass spectrometry. The reproducibility was around 15 % for most compounds and the recoveries were better than 80 % for all analytes except 1, 1 -dichloroethane (59 %). Although the method was originally validated for 13 VOCs, it was found to be applicable for a broader range of VOCs and was tested an eel from the Scheldt estuary. Apart from the priority VOCs several other VOCs turned up rather unexpectedly in these samples.

Despite the desert conditions prevailing in the coastal region, two factors enabled to areas earliest inhabitants to live off the land.

25|$|Production of fourrées began {{almost as}} early as the {{production}} of the first coins in Asia Minor in the 7th century BC.

If the coin was sufficiently heated and struck hard enough, a layer of eutectic alloy (a mixture of 72% silver and 28% copper that has the lowest melting point of any mixture of these two metals) would be produced, fusing the layers together. Sometimes eutectic was sprinkled between the layers to increase the bond.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{experimental}} investigations {{on the role}} of humidity in the laser cleaning technique which simply consists of direct irradiation of the contaminated surfaces.

For the laser parameters we used, we demonstrate that the particle removal results from mechanisms based on the momentum transfer from laser ablated species to the particles. For high laser fluences, a self-limited local ablation of the surface provides the cleaning force. For lower laser fluences, a competition between two humidity-based forces is evidenced: the capillary adhesion force and the explosive evaporation (of water traces) cleaning force. This demonstrates that the humidity plays a major role in the so-called dry laser cleaning technique which aims at meeting the future surface preparation requirements of the emerging nanotechnologies...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that excessive <b>moisture</b> <b>trapped</b> within sealed microelectronic packages can contribute significantly to device failure. 1 Design and process changes can complicate moisture control by causing {{a significant change in}} the ability of the product to absorb moisture and thus should be accompanied by corresponding adjustments in vacuum bake conditions. Proper bakeout is necessary for efficient manufacture of a dry package and work done by M. R. Stahler demonstrates clearly that the Al 2 O 3 moisture sensor chip is a useful tool for determining vacuum bake conditions. When microelectronic devices start failing, one of the first concerns is moisture content. Excessive moisture sealed inside of microelectronic packages has been shown to contribute to gold and silver migration, and ionic effects on devices can occur, producing leakage or inversion. 1. 4 Most major moisture related failures occur long after testing and acceptance.

40|$|Concrete floor slabs dry {{out through}} a process of {{evaporation}} and diffusion provided the ambient environment promotes such drying. Impermeable floor coverings laid on concrete slabs can be subject to damage caused by high levels of residual <b>moisture</b> <b>trapped</b> by premature sealing of the surface. This damage can include timber floor boards buckling, vinyls blistering or tiles lifting. Whether or not it is safe to apply such a covering depends on whether the slab is sufficiently dry. Furthermore, if accelerated drying techniques are employed to reduce the waiting time before covering, the surface relative humidity reduces more rapidly, but there is an increase in the risk of damage to the covering because of higher levels of residual moisture deep within the slab. By using actual data from a variety of specimens to calibrate a non-linear finite-element model of the moisture migration, this paper shows how numerical predictions can be undertaken to determine a safer long-term relative humidity under an impermeable floor covering...|$|R

Concerning the temperature shifting of the peaks the opposite behavior is observed in samples from group B.
