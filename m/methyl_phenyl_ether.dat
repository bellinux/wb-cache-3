40|$|Bacteria {{that belong}} to the genus Desulfitobacterium are able to cleave the ether bond of lignin-borne <b>phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> via O-demethylation of the methoxy moiety. <b>Phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> occur {{naturally}} in soils and originate from lignin degradation by white rot fungi under aerobic conditions. In order to assess the possible involvement of the anaerobic desulfitobacteria in the network of lignin degradation in soils, {{their participation in the}} O-demethylation of <b>phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> in the environment was studied. In growth experiments, several Desulfitobacterium spp. were able to O-demethylate the <b>phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> 4 -hydroxyanisole, syringate, vanillate and isovanillate in the presence of fumarate, nitrate, thiosulfate or Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Only D. metallireducens completely lacked this ability. Up to 18 putative demethylase operons were identified in the genomes of desulfitobacteria. Bacterial enrichment cultures that originated from five different topsoils sampled in the vicinity of Jena (Germany) were used to assess desulfitobacterial O-demethylation in anoxic consortia. Enrichment with syringate and thiosulfate triggered an increase in Desulfitobacterium-specific 16 S rRNA genes in all cultures as confirmed via quantitative PCR. The enrichment was followed by a loss of desulfitobacterial gene copies over time. Community-scale sequencing suggested an outcompetion of desulfitobacteria by acetogens. To allow a better quantification of desulfitobacteria in environmental samples, a new qPCR assay was established that uses the Desulfitobacterium-specific formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene as marker. In contrast to the 16 S rRNA gene assay, which detects several gene copies per genome, the new FTHFS assay detects only one gene copy. It is concluded that Desulfitobacterium spp. are involved in the O-demethylation of <b>phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> in the environment and play an important role within the network of lignin degradation in soils...|$|R

The genes of all components (methyltransferases I and II, CP, and activating enzyme [AE]) of the vanillate- and veratrol-O-demethylases of Acetobacterium dehalogenans were sequenced and analyzed. In A. dehalogenans, the genes for methyltransferase I, CP, and methyltransferase II of both O-demethylases are clustered. The single-copy gene for AE is not included in the O-demethylase gene clusters. It was found that AE grouped with COG 3894 proteins, the function of which was unknown so far. Genes encoding COG 3894 proteins with 20 to 41 % amino acid sequence identity with AE are present in numerous genomes of anaerobic microorganisms. Inspection of the domain structure and genetic context of these orthologs predicts that these are also reductive activases for corrinoid enzymes (RACEs), such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl coenzyme A synthases or anaerobic methyltransferases. The genes encoding the O-demethylase components were heterologously expressed with a C-terminal Strep-tag in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins methyltransferase I, CP, and AE were characterized. Gel shift experiments showed that the AE comigrated with the CP. The formation of other protein complexes with the O-demethylase components was not observed under the conditions used.

The complete genome of the tetrachloroethene (PCE) -dechlorinating strain Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y 51 is a 5, 727, 534 -bp circular chromosome harboring 5, 060 predicted protein coding sequences. This genome contains only two reductive dehalogenase genes, a lower number than reported in most other dehalorespiring strains. More than 50 members of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase superfamily and 30 paralogs of the flavoprotein subunit of the fumarate reductase are encoded as well. A remarkable feature of the genome is the large number of O-demethylase paralogs, which allow utilization of lignin-derived <b>phenyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> as electron donors.

Acetylcholine and histamine were chosen because of their direct mode of action on smooth muscle, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline <b>phenyl</b> <b>ether</b> were used as examples of drugs that act at the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine was the drug investigated. Hyoscine blocked the contractions caused by acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine and the ganglion-stimulants but left the responses to histamine unchanged. The anticholinesterase N,N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidic fluoride (mipafox) potentiated all the agonists except histamine. The strength of potentiation decreased in the order 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline <b>phenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> and acetylcholine. The local anaesthetic procaine inhibited to the same extent contractions elicited by 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline <b>phenyl</b> <b>ether.</b> These results showed that 5 -hydroxytryptamine, like nicotine, choline <b>phenyl</b> <b>ether</b> and dimethylphenylpiperazinium, mediated its response through the nervous plexus. Of those tested 5 -hydroxytryptamine was the only specific antagonist to 5 -hydroxytryptamine; lysergic acid derivatives produced spasm and prolonged changes in tone; phenoxybenzamine caused non-specific block. The diverse modes of action of a number of ganglion-blocking agents were selectively used. Thus hexamethonium, pentolinium, and nicotine in its competitive phase, blocked contractions due to nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline <b>phenyl</b> <b>ether</b> and left those due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine and histamine unchanged. The depolarizing ganglion-blocking agents, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and nicotine, inhibited the responses to all the indirectly acting drugs.
