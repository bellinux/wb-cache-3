5|$|In late 2001, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline {{in which}} they were feuding with one another. Lita {{refereed}} a match between them at Vengeance on December 9. Jeff won the match with a scripted finish that had Lita failing to notice that <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> placed his leg on the rope during Jeff's successful pin attempt. Continuing the storyline on the following episode of Raw, Matt defeated Lita and Jeff in a handicap match, shortly after informing Lita that both their relationship and the Hardy Boyz were finished. On the December 17 episode of Raw, both Jeff and Lita were sidelined with storyline injuries following a title match between Jeff and WWF Hardcore Champion The Undertaker. The injuring of both his brother and ex-girlfriend led to a reconciliation between the members of Team Xtreme, and on the December 20 episode of SmackDown!, Matt faced The Undertaker but was also injured. All three members of Team Xtreme were then removed from WWF television for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III in a Full Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with a Twist of Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> later lost.|$|E
25|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> also {{wondered}} why people were chasing {{him and the}} unknown female character, but it all {{ends up in the}} Chicago area in the game. One morning, somebody took the keys from Matt's car that the unknown female character got him, and stole the car. Matt has to follow the person and had to follow the driver. As it turns out, the driver that took the keys, was the unknown female character in his perspective. She later gives a case to somebody that knows her, and Matt is forced to leave the area without her.|$|E

25|$|Through 2010, Homestar Runner {{remained}} {{financially viable}} for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had {{their children to}} care for, and they recognized that {{they would need to}} find other jobs to support their respective families. When <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would {{want to come back to}} it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series Yo Gabba Gabba!, Gravity Falls, The Aquabats Super Show, and Wander Over Yonder.|$|E
25|$|Daredevil volume 4 {{ended with}} issue #18 in September 2015.

He will have a redesigned costume and a new apprentice in Samuel Chung, an illegal immigrant who has been living in New York's Chinatown since he was a child, who has taken up the codename Blindspot. When the Purple Children acquired a machine designed by their father to enhance his powers, after <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> saved them from a mob, they used the machine to erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil, Matt only allowing Foggy to know his secret identity afterwards, enabling him to be re-instated as a New York Attorney. Using his restored secret identity, Murdock is {{able to take advantage of}} a subsequent court case to establish a precedent for superheroes testifying in court without the need to expose their secret identities.

500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, <b>Matt,</b> <b>had</b> a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember {{what it feels like to}} be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> been {{informed}} that the crossing area and its environs were clear of Egyptian forces, but out of caution, ordered his tank company to deploy at the Lexicon-Tirtur junction to confront any Egyptian movements towards the crossing site, just [...] south of the crossroads.

Meanwhile, Israeli artillery batteries opened fire on the landing site on the west bank, delivering around 70 tons of shells and ordnance. In fact, the opposite bank was completely clear of Egyptian troops. The crossing finally got underway at 1:35 AM, over five hours behind schedule. By 9:00 AM, 2,000 paratroopers had crossed, along with a battalion of thirty tanks. The Israelis sent raiding parties attacking Egyptian SAMs on the west bank, while securing a [...] without facing resistance.|$|E

500|$|Matt Holliday and his wife, Leslee, {{married on}} December 30, 2000. [...] They {{met on a}} blind date in 1999 in Stillwater during the {{baseball}} offseason when <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> returned home from his first professional season following his selection by the Rockies in the MLB draft and Leslee was an undergraduate at OSU−Stillwater. [...] Matt’s best friend was dating a friend of Leslee’s, and they wanted to do a double date, so her friend asked if she would go with Matt. [...] The Hollidays currently reside in St. Louis, Missouri, and Jupiter, Florida, and have four children. They have three sons, Jackson (born December 4, 2003), Ethan (b.

2500|$|Brown {{moved his}} drawing {{away from the}} overt Harold Gray {{influence}} (as seen in Louis Riel and Underwater) towards a style inspired by the [...] "very stylized, stiff look" [...] of Fletcher Hanks. [...] Close friend Joe Matt also had an influence. [...] Some scenes deliberately echoed scenes in Matt's graphic novel Spent. [...] He set scenes in places that had been depicted in Matt's comics, and did his own take on a restaurant scene that <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> done.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{then proceed}} {{to find the}} {{tracking}} system, where both are surprised to find it's a young girl — though only Matt is completely surprised: Bennet claims {{he knew it was}} a person, just not a little girl — whom <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> previously rescued from Sylar, and who thought of Matt as [...] "my hero."

2500|$|In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local {{battle of}} the bands, smashing their {{equipment}} in the process. Bellamy said: [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously." [...] The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth. The name [...] "Muse" [...] was supposedly inspired by Matthew Bellamy's art teacher Samuel Theoun. The band liked that it was short and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect [...] "the sense <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1994 and 1995 seasons {{established}} Kenseth as a short track star. Kenseth made a {{name for}} himself while driving at several Wisconsin tracks, beating nationally known drivers such as Dick Trickle and Robbie Reiser. He raced 60 times in three different cars in 1994, winning track championships at both Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR) on Thursday nights and Madison on Friday nights. Kenseth competed against Reiser at Madison, and won 12 of 17 features at the track. He won the 1994 Slinger Nationals at Slinger Super Speedway.

2500|$|Following these events, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Disco" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests stood atop gold discs attached to the tops of hanging disco balls and were spun around continuously while holding on with the chains used to attach the disco balls to the metal structure. The last HouseGuest remaining on their ball without falling would become the new Head of Household. When James and Natalie were the last two remaining, James promised Natalie that both she and Matt would be safe if she allowed him to win Head of Household. This led to Natalie {{dropping out of the}} competition, making James the winner. James, upset that three people had voted for him not to return, attempted to figure out who had voted for Alex to return. Though Ryan and Sheila confessed to their votes, Matt continued to deny that he had cast the third vote. On Day 36, James chose to nominate Ryan and Sheila for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Matt, Chelsia, and Joshuah were selected to compete; Natalie was selected to host. On Day 37, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Trapped in the Cage" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, players were required to walk along a series of balance beams in an attempt to transfer 500 blocks from a cage to their tube. They could only move two blocks at a time, and dropping a block or falling would result in their elimination; the first HouseGuest to successfully get their blocks into their tube would win. James was the winner, making him the first HouseGuest this season to win both Head of Household and Power of Veto in the same week. Despite James wanting to backdoor Adam, Sharon later convinced James that <b>Matt</b> <b>had</b> been the third vote and should be evicted that week. On Day 39, James chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Sheila from the block, with Matt being nominated in her place. On Day 42, Matt became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when James broke a tie in Ryan's favor. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
