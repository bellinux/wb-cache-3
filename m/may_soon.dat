5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson {{classified}} the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in {{the genus}} Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E

5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> collapse into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the episode {{primarily}} deal with Lord Eddard Stark's investigations into {{the death of the}} previous Hand. In the city of King's Landing, the Tourney of the Hand comes to an end while the various factions that plot for power are revealed to the viewer. This delicate balance is undone when news arrives that Tyrion Lannister has been arrested by Catelyn Stark. The title of the episode refers {{to the fact that the}} Starks, whose sigil is a wolf, <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> be at war with the Lannisters, whose sigil is the lion.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E

25|$|In recent decades, {{overfishing}} {{has left}} many fisheries unproductive, disturbing {{marine food chain}} dynamics and costing jobs in the fishing industry. Herring, cod and plaice fisheries <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> face the same plight as mackerel fishing, which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing.|$|E
25|$|The system {{created by}} the Silent Sejm {{dominated}} the Polish political scene until the late 18th century, when {{a new wave of}} reforms led to the Constitution of the 3 <b>May,</b> <b>soon</b> followed by partitions of Poland and loss of Polish sovereignty for 123years.|$|E

25|$|New {{demand has}} {{recently}} strained supply, {{and there is}} growing concern that the world <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from 2009 worldwide demand for rare-earth elements is expected to exceed supply by 40,000 tonnes annually unless major new sources are developed.|$|E
25|$|In October, Alan Beatie and Alice Ross for the Financial Times {{noted that}} the global trade {{imbalances}} which had driven the currency war have been sharply reduced. However, they suggest that without further reforms, the imbalances <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> widen again. They also note that Mantega once more raised the alarm about competitive devaluation, following the United States's launch of QE3 in September.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the off-label 'mini-dose' is to avoid an {{emergency}} condition that may require glucagon rescue. This might be needed in cases such as when a diabetic child is injected with insulin before breakfast, eats, and then vomits and cannot eat again: with the injected insulin working {{its way into the}} bloodstream and no carbohydrate to balance, there <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> be a hypoglycemic emergency.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating from}} RADA in 2000, <b>Mays</b> <b>soon</b> started {{appearing}} {{in a number}} of supporting roles ranging from a bit part in the BBC soap opera EastEnders in 2000 to playing a pilot in Jerry Bruckheimer's big-budget Pearl Harbor (2001). He was cast in the Mike Leigh film All or Nothing (2002) as Jason, a thug who abused his girlfriend, and also appeared in Leigh's next project, Vera Drake (2004), in which he played Sid, the protagonist's son. His performances for Leigh resulted in further offers of work.|$|R

25|$|Aspartame is {{currently}} the most popular artificial sweetener in the U.S. food industry, as the price has dropped significantly since its patent registered by Monsanto Company expired in 1992. However, sucralose <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> replace it, as alternative processes to Tate & Lyle's patent seem to be emerging. According to Morgan Stanley, this can mean {{that the price of}} sucralose will drop by thirty percent.|$|E
25|$|While {{the higher}} {{taxonomy}} is fairly well understood, the lower taxonomy within the Serpula genus is somewhat confusing, {{and not yet}} thoroughly worked out. Earlier sources have described as many as 77 different species and subspecies. However, there are currently only 29 recognized species in the Genus Serpula. The number and names of these species <b>may</b> <b>soon</b> change {{as a result of}} an ongoing revision of the genus by taxonomists.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Media and the BPI denied {{reports of}} any {{agreement}} or pilot scheme {{and said they}} were only in talks on the matter.
