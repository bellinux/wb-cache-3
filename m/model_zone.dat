40|$|Abstract. A {{document}} can {{be divided}} into zones {{on the basis of its}} content. For example, a zone can be either text or non-text. Given the segmented document zones, correctly determining the zone content type is very important for the subsequent processes within any document image understanding system. This paper describes an algorithm for the determination of zone type of a given zone within an input document image. In our zone classification algorithm, zones are represented as feature vectors. Each feature vector consists of a set of 25 measurements of pre-defined properties. A probabilistic model, decision tree, is used to classify each zone on the basis of its feature vector. Two methods are used to optimize the decision tree classifier to eliminate the data over-fitting problem. To enrich our probabilistic model, we incorporate context constraints for certain zones within their neighboring zones. We also <b>model</b> <b>zone</b> class context constraints as a Hidden Markov Model and used Viterbi algorithm to obtain optimal classification results. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 600 images drawn from the UWCDROM-III document image database. With a total of 24, 177 zones within the data set, the cross-validation method was used in the performance evaluation of the classifier. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 − 18 pt and font size 19 − 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. A zone content classification performance evaluation protocol is proposed. Using this protocol, our algorithm accuracy is 98. 45 % with a mean false alarm rate of 0. 50 %. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{update of}} the initial European Landslide Susceptibility Map (ELSUS 1000 Version 1) {{released}} in 2013 through the EC Joint Research Centre (JRC) European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) is presented. As in the previous map, the methodology employed for the updated map ELSUS Version 2 comprises {{the division of the}} analyzed European area into seven climate-physiographic <b>model</b> <b>zones,</b> the use of a reduced set of spatial susceptibility predictors (slope angle, shallow subsurface lithology, and land cover), and specific heuristic spatial multicriteria evaluations (SMCE) of <b>model</b> <b>zones</b> for susceptibility mapping. However, in the improved new version of ELSUS the original “lithology” data set consisting of soil parent material information derived from the European Soil Database (ESDB) is replaced by new information obtained from the International Hydrogeological Map of Europe at 1 : 1. 5 Million scale (IHME 1500). IHME lithology describes both consolidated and unconsolidated shallow geologic materials over Europe, showing a higher significance for landslide susceptibility assessment than the soil parent material above. Additionally, in version 2 the mapping unit cell size increases from 1 km to 200 m and new areas such as Iceland, Cyprus, the Faroes, and the Shetlands are covered on the map. Moreover, the new ELSUS Version 2 has been calibrated and validated with an updated pan-European landslide inventory now containing more than 155, 000 landslides (30 % more than used for ELSUS Version 1). A further improvement is the geographic adjustment of the slope angle, lithology and land cover spatial susceptibility criteria to uniform coastline information derived from VMAP 1000 data now allowing for an area-wide susceptibility mapping of European coastal areas. The expanded and updated landslide inventory and the higher quality of the “lithology” data have enabled us to establish more consistent SMCE schemes for the individual <b>model</b> <b>zones.</b> The enhancements of ELSUS Version 2 result in an overall increase of the predictive power of the map of about 10 %, as shown by ROC curve metrics obtained with the updated landslide inventory.

Though parameters of storage <b>zone</b> <b>model</b> can not be estimated directly because of the unstable condition of numerical calculations, Marquardt's method is applicable by the modification of the combination of parameters as given by eq.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Prediction {{accuracy}} of <b>zone</b> <b>models</b> {{is attributed to}} the sophistication of the mathematical model, {{as well as the}} numerical methods applied in their implementation. Well-known <b>zone</b> <b>models</b> CFAST and OZone have gained world-wide acceptance among the fire engineering community in predicting enclosure fire dynamics. Despite these models serving similar purpose, the level of accuracy and applicability range are still a field of active research. This study compares an in-house developed <b>zone</b> <b>model</b> CFMFAN with CFAST and OZone in their modeling concepts, prediction capability, and accuracy. The sub-models for gas flow, heat transfer, and heat release rate are examined. Performance comparisons of these <b>zone</b> <b>models</b> with published experimental results for 20 single compartment fire tests are carried out in the blind mode. The test parameters used are the fire size (330 – 980 kW) and the fire location (center or side). For performance comparisons, the upper- and lower-layer temperatures, interface and neutral plane heights, pressure difference at the floor, wall temperatures, plume flow, and vent flow rates are compared. Upon comparison with compartment fire test results, the study shows that CFAST consistently overpredicts the upper-layer temperature whereas OZone and CFMFAN underpredict it for all fire sizes. All the models underpredict the lower-layer temperature. Explanations are given for the deviations of the three models from the test results and from one another.

40|$|We {{present an}} update {{of the initial}} version of the European Landslide Susceptibility Map (ELSUS Version 1) that was {{released}} in 2012 through the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC). The susceptibility evaluation methodology employed for the updated map ELSUS Version 2 {{presented in this paper}} is identical to the previous approach, and comprises the differentiation of the analyzed European area into seven climate-physiographical <b>model</b> <b>zones,</b> the use of a reduced set of spatial susceptibility predictors (shallow subsurface lithology, slope angle, and land cover), and model zone-specific heuristic spatial multicriteria evaluations (SMCE) for susceptibility mapping. The most important improvement for ELSUS version 2 is the replacement of the original “lithology” data set consisting of soil parent material information derived from the European Soil Database (ESDB) by new information derived from the digital version of the International Hydrogeological Map of Europe at scale 1 : 1. 5 Million (IHME 1500). IHME lithology describes both consolidated and unconsolidated shallow geological materials over Europe and can be shown to have a higher significance for landslide susceptibility evaluation than the soil parent material derived from ESDB. Other improvements consist in the change of the mapping unit from 1 km to 200 m grid size and the incorporation of terrains not covered by ELSUS version 1 (e. g., Iceland, the Faroers, the Shetlands, and Cyprus). Additionally, the new ELSUS version 2 was calibrated and validated with an updated pan-European landslide inventory now containing more than 155, 000 landslides (30 % more than used for ELSUS version 1). The enhanced and updated landslide inventory and the higher quality of the “lithology” data enabled us to establish more consistent SMCE-schemes for the individual <b>model</b> <b>zones.</b> The enhancements of ELSUS Version 2 result in an overall increase of the predictive power of the map for about 10 %, as indicated by ROC curve metrics obtained with the updated landslide inventory. However, the assessment still suffers from missing landslide information in many European terrains. It can be suspected that more distributed landslides information in specific <b>model</b> <b>zones</b> will further enhance the accuracy of ELSUS in the future. JRC.
