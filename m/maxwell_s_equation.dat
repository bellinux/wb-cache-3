40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{accurate}} simulation of phase-shifting masks in optical lithography requires representation as full 3 D objects, as opposed to binary masks. To simulate these objects, the electromagnetic field in the neighborhood of the mask must be calculated. The additional step of solving <b>Maxwell</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> tends to consume a large amount of CPU time compared to conventional simulation in which Kirchhoffs approximation of an infinitely thin mask is used.

40|$|Formulations {{for second}} and higher {{harmonic}} frequency {{up and down}} conversions, as well as multi photon processes directly assume summability and divisibility of photons. Quantum mechanical (QM) interpretations are completely congruent with these assumptions. However, for linear optical phenomena (interference, diffraction, refraction, material dispersion, spectral dispersion, etc.), we have a profound dichotomy. Most optical engineers innovate and analyze all optical instruments by propagating pure classical electromagnetic (EM) fields using <b>Maxwell</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> and gives only lip-service to the concept "indivisible light quanta". Further, irrespective of linearity or nonlinearity of the phenomena, the final results are always registered through some photo-electric or photo-chemical effects. This is mathematically well modeled by a quadratic action (energy absorption) relation. Since QM does not preclude divisibility or summability of photons in nonlinear & multi-photon effects, it cannot have any foundational reason against these same possibilities in linear optical phenomena.

TLM models <b>Maxwell</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> by discretising the contiguous nature of an environment and its contents into individual small-scale elements {{and it is a}} computationally intensive process. This thesis focusses on parallel processing optimisations to the TLM method when considering the opposing ends of the contemporary computing hardware spectrum, namely large-scale computing systems versus small-scale mobile computing devices. Theoretical aspects covered in this thesis are: The historical development and derivation of the TLM method. A discrete random variable (DRV) for rain-drop diameter,allowing generation of a rain-field with raindrops adhering to a Gaussian size distribution, as a case study for a 3 -D TLM implementation. Investigations into parallel computing strategies for accelerating TLM on large and small-scale computing platforms.

A 3 -D TLM implementation designed for simulating the effects of rain-fields on extremely high frequency (EHF) band signals. By optimising both TLM solver implementations for their respective platforms, new opportunities present themselves. Rain-field simulations containing individual rain-drop geometry can be simulated, which was previously impractical due to the lengthy computation times required. Also, computationally time-intensive methods such as TLM were previously impractical on mobile computing devices.

40|$|A {{review of}} those forms of {{standard}} quantum mechanics {{that include the}} Pauli Exclusion Principle as it is applied to atomic species, (that is versions of quantum that are multi-electron and multi-orbital) shows they are not consistent with energy conservation. Particular focus is given to helium {{in which it is}} shown that energy conservation is not consistent with current models. If the two electrons in the ground state, per current theory, are at the same energy as the ionization energy, it is demonstrated that according to the standard theory approximately 30 eV are lost during ionization, or alternatively, about 30 eV of energy are created during ionization/electron attachment. The same issue of energy loss during relaxation of energy levels following ionization is shown to exist for all atomic species, thus demonstrating that the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) and energy conservation are not consistent for any atomic species for current forms of distinguishable electron forms of quantum theory. Only that form of quantum that has a single orbital, and for which only one ionization energy can be computed (that is the original Schrodinger form), is consistent with an energy balance. However, this form is not consistent with common spectroscopy results, and it is argued PEP has no meaning in this form of quantum theory.

40|$|A paper {{discusses}} {{the need to}} perform accurate dielectric property measurements on larger sized samples, particularly liquids at microwave frequencies. These types of measurements cannot be obtained using conventional cavity perturbation methods, particularly for liquids or powdered or granulated solids that require a surrounding container. To solve this problem, a model has been developed for the resonant frequency and quality factor of a cylindrical microwave cavity containing concentric cylindrical samples. This model can then be inverted to obtain the real and imaginary dielectric constants of the material of interest. This approach is based on using exact solutions to <b>Maxwell</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the resonant properties of a cylindrical microwave cavity and also using the effective electrical conductivity of the cavity walls that is estimated from the measured empty cavity quality factor. This new approach calculates the complex resonant frequency and associated electromagnetic fields for a cylindrical microwave cavity with lossy walls that is loaded with concentric, axially aligned, lossy dielectric cylindrical samples. In this approach, the calculated complex resonant frequency, consisting of real and imaginary parts, {{is related to the}} experimentally measured quantities. Because this approach uses Maxwell's equations to determine the perturbed electromagnetic fields in the cavity with the material(s) inserted, one can calculate the expected wall losses using the fields for the loaded cavity rather than just depending on the value of the fields obtained from the empty cavity quality factor. These additional calculations provide a more accurate determination of the complex dielectric constant of the material being studied. The improved approach will be particularly important when working with larger samples or samples with larger dielectric constants that will further perturb the cavity electromagnetic fields. Also, this approach enables the ability to have a larger sample of interest, such as a liquid or powdered or granulated solid, inside a cylindrical container...|$|R

There is always a delicate balance between physical explanations and their mathematical interpretations. This balance is very personal and is based on your background. I came to the field of atmospheric radiative transfer as a mathematician with little knowledge of atmospheric physics. After being in the field for more than a decade, I still have gaps in my atmospheric science education. Thus I assess a radiative transfer book fi-om two main criteria: how well does it describe the material that is familiar to me (the radiative transfer equation and its numerical solutions) and how well does it help me to fill the gaps in my personal knowledge.

These substances {{would allow a}} flat structure to focus electromagnetic (EM) waves {{because they have a}} negative index of refraction. A similar structure made from conventional materials, those with a positive index of refraction, would disperse the waves. But until recently, these structures have been purely theoretical because substances with both a negative permittivity and negative permeability, material properties necessary for a negative index of refraction, do not naturally exist, Recent developments have produced a structure composed of an array of thin wires and split ring resonators that shows a negative index of refraction. area smaller than a square wavelength. How small the area is can be determined by how perfectly the lens is polished and how pure the substance is that composes the lens. These lenses must also be curved for focusing to occur. The focal length is determined by the curvature of the lens and the material. On the other hand, a flat structure made from LHM would focus light because of the effect of a negative index of refraction in Snell s law. The focal length could also be varied by simply adjusting the distance of the lens from the source of radiation.

40|$|Ultrashort laser pulses are a {{powerful}} tool for modifying the structure and properties of transparent materials. Depending on material properties and irradiation conditions, a wide variety of modifications can be induced such as surface and bulk periodic structures (nanogratings), densification with associated refractive index change, microvoids and void chains, phase transitions, etc. This gives rise to numerous technological applications based on 3 D photonic structures in bulk optical materials (waveguides, Bragg gratings, Fresnel zone plates, rewritable optical memories, and others). Among transparent materials, optical glasses are of prime importance for optoelectronics and photonics due to their relatively low cost, processability, and possibility of governing refractive index and inducing optical anisotropy. The physics behind laser-induced glass modification is extremely rich and involves the multiplicity of the consecutive processes initiated by radiation absorption during the laser pulse and extending to millisecond time scales when the final structure becomes. frozen. in the glass matrix. While tremendous achievements have been made toward laser-writing techniques and assembling integrated optics, the physical mechanisms underlying glass modifications have not been fully understood. However, further development of laser-writing techniques for controllable generation of desired modifications in transparent materials is impossible without deep understanding of the governing mechanisms of modifications. In this report, we will review the physical processes and mechanisms responsible for various forms of glass modification. Different routes of photoexcitation with creation of dense plasma inside glass bulk will be analyzed depending on the irradiation conditions. Relative contributions of multi-photon and tunneling ionizations and the avalanche process will be considered. The thermodynamic and thermomechanical processes following plasma recombination at different space and time scales will be discussed. A number of intriguing experimental evidences will be canvassed with their detailed theoretical analysis. The results of modeling based on the <b>Maxwell.</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> will be presented for the particular irradiation regimes when different modifications are observed such as nanograting structures and microvoids.

40|$|The {{presence}} of wave motion is the defining feature in many fields of application,such as electro-magnetics, seismics, acoustics, aerodynamics,oceanography and optics. In these fields, accurate numerical simulation of wave phenomena {{is important for}} the enhanced understanding of basic phenomenon, but also in design and development of various engineering applications. In general, numerical simulations must be confined to truncated domains, much smaller than the physical space were the wave phenomena takes place. To truncate the physical space, artificial boundaries, and corresponding boundary conditions, are introduced. There are four main classes of methods {{that can be used to}} truncate problems on unbounded or large domains: boundary integral methods, infinite element methods, non-reflecting boundary condition methods and absorbing layer methods. In this thesis, we consider different aspects of non-reflecting boundary conditions and absorbing layers. In paper I, we construct discretely non-reflecting boundary conditions for a high order centered finite difference scheme. This is done by separating the numerical solution into spurious and physical waves, using the discrete dispersion relation. In paper II-IV, we focus on the perfectly matched layer method, which is a particular absorbing layer method. An open issue is whether stable perfectly matched layers can be constructed for a general hyperbolic system. In paper II, we present a stable perfectly matched layer formulation for 2 x 2 symmetric hyperbolic systems in (2 + 1) dimensions. We also show how to choose the layer parameters as functions of the coefficient matrices to guarantee stability. In paper III, we construct a new perfectly matched layer for the simulation of elastic waves in an anisotropic media. We present theoretical and numerical results, showing that the stability properties of the present layer are better than previously suggested layers. In paper IV, we develop general tools for constructing PMLs for first order hyperbolic systems. We present a model with many parameters which is applicable to all hyperbolic systems, and which we prove is well-posed and perfectly matched. We also use an automatic method, derived in paper V, for analyzing the stability of the model and establishing energy inequalities. We illustrate our techniques with applications to <b>Maxwell</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations,</b> the linearized Euler equations, as well as arbitrary 2 x 2 systems in (2 + 1) dimensions. In paper V, we use the method of Sturm sequences for bounding the real parts of roots of polynomials, to construct an automatic method for checking Petrowsky well-posedness of a general Cauchy problem. We prove that this method can be adapted to automatically symmetrize any well-posed problem, producing an energy estimate involving only local quantities. QC 2010083...|$|R

Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness.
