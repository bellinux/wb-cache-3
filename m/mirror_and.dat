In 1906 he accompanied Princess Ena to Spain for her marriage to King Alfonso XIII, where he took the first formal portrait of the couple before their wedding.

5|$|Record {{charts in}} the United Kingdom began life on 14 November 1952 when NME imitated an idea started in American Billboard {{magazine}} and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, {{there had been}} no universally accepted chart. During this time the BBC used aggregated results of charts from the <b>Mirror</b> <b>and</b> other sources to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. However, according to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. After that date and until 1969 a chart compiled by Record Retailer is considered the official British singles chart.|$|E
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation.

The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified {{that he had heard}} no mention of the alleged bribes.|$|E
