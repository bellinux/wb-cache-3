5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for <b>monitoring</b> <b>progress</b> of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{and still a}} commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a round bottom flask of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen or argon gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal. Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H2-filled balloon. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for <b>monitoring</b> <b>progress</b> of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous copper sulfate or with gauges for each reaction vessel.|$|E
2500|$|Performance {{management}} behavior: Along with conscientiousness, high CSE {{predicted a}} more positive judgment of team effectiveness and ability (i.e., high collective efficacy), which in turn leads to improved performance management team behavior (e.g., establishing team goals, coordinating tasks, <b>monitoring</b> <b>progress</b> toward goal).
