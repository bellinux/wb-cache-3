40|$|The net {{growth rate}} of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> {{entering}} the Westerschelde estuary was investigated using an advective-dispersive transport model that simulates zooplankton biomass behaving conservatively in the estuary. Total biomass of marine zooplankters in the Westerschelde was much lower than what would be expected based on transport alone, indicating negative growth rates in the estuary. Including a net consumption term in the transport model allowed the estimation of total net mortality. About 3 % of all marine zooplankters that enter the Westerschelde with the flood currents are retained in the estuary, where they die. On average, 5 % of the total <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> biomass in the estuary died per day. Each year a net amount of about 1500 t of zooplankton dry weight (DW) is imported from the sea to the estuary. Thus in the Westerschelde the <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> persists mainly due to continuous replenishment from the sea. Average net production/biomass rates of the major <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> species varied from - 0. 02 g DW (gDW) - 1 d - 1 (Temora longicornis) to - 0. 39 g DW (gDW) - 1 d - 1 (Pseudocalanus elongatus).

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{importance of}} <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> cannot be overestimated. Throughout the world’s oceans, plankton species abundance and diversity impact, determine and drive global cycles, food-web structure and ecosystem stability (Banse, 1995; Sommer, 1996; Lindley et al., 2003). Plankton communities mediate transfer {{of organic matter}} from the productive photic zone to deep waters, and biogeochemical processes that drive the carbon cycle (Russell-Hunter, 1970). Plankton species form the foundation for productivity and the harvest of the seas and monitoring data on these species are important to inform marine management (Brander et al., 2003; Reid et al., 2003; Stevens et al., 2006). We know that anthropogenic influences, together with climatic factors and changes affect their diversity, distribution and dynamics in marine ecosystems (Molinero et al., 2005, 2008). Marine research projects, surveys and monitoring programmes often require routine taxonomic identification of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> (Bottger-Schnack et al., 2004). This work requires taxonomic skills and knowledge that are nowadays very scarce. Critical reference texts, keys and other relevant information are sometimes difficult to find. Many of the species monographs and papers required are out of print and access to these is often restricted to a few libraries. Since revisions of taxonomic groups and general taxonomic changes may be published at any time, {{it is important for}} up-to-date information to be accessed.

40|$|AbstractToxic {{effects of}} {{petroleum}} to <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> have been generally investigated using dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons {{and in the}} absence of sunlight. In this study, we determined the influence of natural ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on the lethal and sublethal toxicity of dispersed crude oil to naupliar stages of the planktonic copepods Acartia tonsa, Temora turbinata and Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus. Low concentrations of dispersed crude oil (1  μL L− 1) caused a significant reduction in survival, growth and swimming activity of copepod nauplii after 48  h of exposure. UVB radiation increased toxicity of dispersed crude oil by 1. 3 – 3. 8 times, depending on the experiment and measured variables. Ingestion of crude oil droplets may increase photoenhanced toxicity of crude oil to copepod nauplii by enhancing photosensitization. Photoenhanced sublethal toxicity was significantly higher when T.  turbinata nauplii were exposed to dispersant-treated oil than crude oil alone, suggesting that chemical dispersion of crude oil may promote photoenhanced toxicity to <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton.</b> Our results demonstrate that acute exposure to concentrations of dispersed crude oil and dispersant (Corexit 9500) commonly found in the sea after oil spills are highly toxic to copepod nauplii and that natural levels of UVB radiation substantially increase the toxicity of crude oil to these planktonic organisms. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering sunlight in petroleum toxicological studies and models to better estimate the impact of crude oil spills on <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton...</b>|$|R

40|$|Current {{changes in}} the oceans, {{including}} global warming and ocean acidification, are partially caused by human activity, unlike earlier episodes of change throughout geological history. Understanding and forecasting the responses of marine organisms to these changes is top priority for scientists, managers and policy makers. Yet, relatively little is known {{of the effects of}} ocean change on <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton.</b> Ocean change affects species diversity and distributions, but different zooplankton taxa may not be equally affected. This thesis aims to fill this knowledge gap by contributing information regarding the taxonomy, genetic diversity, and biogeography of several selected <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> groups, providing baseline information that is needed to track the effects of ocean change on <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton.</b> The study organisms in this thesis represent two groups of planktonic gastropods: pteropods (sea butterflies and sea angels) and heteropods (sea elephants), and a group of crustaceans: the hyperiid amphipods. Pteropods are uniquely suitable for the study of long‐term evolutionary processes in the open ocean because their aragonite shells provide a good fossil record. They have been proposed as bioindicators to monitor the impacts of ocean acidification. Heteropods are another group of pelagic gastropods that independently colonized the pelagic. They are visual predators that prey upon shelled pteropods. Shelled heteropods have received little attention relative to pteropods, but are probably equally vulnerable to the effects of ocean acidification. Hyperiids represent a highly diverse and abundant group and are often commensals and parasitoids of gelatinous plankton. They play unique and important ecological roles in pelagic foodwebs. The major questions that are being addressed in this thesis are: (1) How can closely related pteropod species be distinguished? (2) When did current pteropod biodiversity evolve?

40|$|Metabarcoding (large-scale taxonomic {{identification}} of complex samples via analysis {{of one or}} few orthologous DNA regions, called barcodes) is revolutionizing analysis of biodiversity of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> assemblages. Metabarcoding relies on high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies, which yield millions of DNA sequences in parallel and allow large-scale analysis of environmental samples. Metabarcoding studies of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> have used various regions of nuclear small- (18 S) and large-subunit (28 S) rRNA, which allow accurate classification of novel sequences and reliable amplification with consensus primers, but- due to their relatively conserved nature- may underestimate species diversity in a community. To discriminate species, more variable genes are needed. A limited number of metabarcoding studies have used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), which ensures detection of species-level diversity, but may require group-specific primers and thus result in inconsistent amplification success rates. Reference databases with sequences for accurately-identified species are critically needed to allow taxonomic designation of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) and comparison with previous studies of zooplankton diversity. Potential and promising applications of metabarcoding include rapid detection of impacts of climate change, monitoring and assessment of ecosystem health, calculation of biotic indices, characterization of food webs and detection of introduced, non-indigenous species...|$|R

Although the {{ecological}} and evolutionary responses of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> {{to climate change}} {{have the potential to}} strongly influence commercially important species, we know very little about the processes that drive adaptive genetic divergence and evolution in these species. Selection is likely a dominant driver of evolution in <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton,</b> and population genomics provides a powerful approach to investigate selection and adaptive evolution in non- model species. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci assayed in 322 animals collected across a latitudinal basin-scale transect in the Atlantic Ocean (49 °N – 45 °S, 12 sites), we document divergence among populations of the planktonic copepod Pleuromamma xiphias in equatorial and subtropical/temperate waters. FST outlier tests identified 57 loci putatively under directional selection, and when these loci were removed, differentiation between equatorial and subtropical/temperate populations persisted, suggesting that these parapatric and partially co- occurring populations are not driven by outlier loci. Genetic differentiation among northern and southern gyre sites also was observed in Bayesian clustering, principal component, and pairwise FST analyses, with a total of three genetically distinct populations detected across the Atlantic basin. Prior work on this species using mitochondrial (mt) polymorphisms had identified 2 primary mt clades in the Atlantic Ocean (clades 2, 3). Combining the SNP data and mitochondrial markers revealed discordant patterns: mt clade 2 animals only occur within SNP cluster 1 (equatorial), whereas mt clade 3 animals occur in both SNP clusters (equatorial & subtropical/temperate). Widespread sharing of identical haplotypes among SNP clusters may suggest recent or ongoing mitochondrial introgression among these incipient species, with both phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns indicative of introgression from the subtropical/temperate species into the equatorial endemic. Such mitochondrial-nuclear discordance has not been previously reported in <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton.</b> Our results yield insight into the processes of population divergence and mitochondrial introgression among plankton populations in distinct ocean habitats, and suggest that geographically proximate populations can diverge even in very high dispersal systems...|$|R

Government work and is in the public domain in the U. S. A. Climatic effects in the ocean at the community level are poorly described, yet accurate predictions about ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions rely on understanding biotic responses in a food-web context to support knowledge about direct biotic responses to the physical environment. Here we conduct time-series analyses with multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models of <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> abundance in the Northern California Current from 1996 to 2009 to determine the influence of climate variables on zooplankton community interactions. Autoregressive models showed different community interactions during warm vs. cool ocean climate conditions. Negative ecological interactions among zooplankton groups characterized the major warm phase during the time series, whereas during the major cool phase, ocean transport largely structured zooplankton communities. Local environmental conditions (sea temperature) and large-scale climate indices (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) were associated with changes in zooplankton abundance across the full time series. Secondary environmental correlates of zooplankton abundance varied with ocean climate phase, with most support during the warm phase for upwelling as a covariate, and most support during the cool phase for salinity.

40|$|According to {{life history}} theory, {{development}} times {{have evolved to}} an optimum solution of the trade-offs between rapid development and high fecundity: rapidly developing individuals have a higher chance of surviving to maturity than do slowly developing ones, but they mature at a smaller size and, thus, have lower fecundity. Here we develop a model to predict egg-to-adult times in marine pelagic marine copepods that maximizes fitness, quantified either as lifetime reproductive output or population growth rate. The model is tested against global data sets of development time {{as a function of}} temperature. The optimum development time increases when the enhancement of fecundity with delayed maturation increases, and it decreases with increasing juvenile mortality. Our predictions match the patterns in nature for broadcast spawners, for which most data are available, but appear to underpredict development times for sac-spawning copepods. The partial uncoupling of growth and development rates in copepods demonstrated in laboratory experiments, the substantial variation in age at maturity observed in copepod field populations, as well as the fair match of predicted and observed development times together suggest that development rates in marine pelagic copepods are tuned to the prevailing predation mortality. Observations in freshwater zooplankton suggest that life histories may be adapted to local conditions of growth and predation mortality.

40|$|Copepods are {{dominant}} {{members of}} the <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton.</b> Their diets often comprise large proportions of diatom taxa whose silicified frustules are mechanically stable and offer protection against grazers. Despite of this protection, many copepod species are able to efficiently break even the most stable frustule types. This ability requires specific feeding tools with mechanically adapted architectures, compositions and properties. When ingesting food, the copepods use the gnathobases of their mandibles to grab and, if necessary, crush and mince the food items. The morphology of these gnathobases {{is related to the}} diets of the copepods. Gnathobases of copepod species that mainly feed on phytoplankton feature compact and stable tooth-like structures, so-called teeth. In several copepod species these gnathobase teeth have been found to contain silica. Recent studies revealed that the siliceous teeth are complex microscale composites with silica-containing cap-like structures located on chitinous exoskeleton sockets that are connected with rubber-like bearings formed by structures with high proportions of the soft and elastic protein resilin. In addition, the silica-containing cap-like structures exhibit a nanoscale composite architecture. They contain some amorphous silica and large proportions of the crystalline silica type α-cristobalite and are pervaded by a fine chitinous fibre network that very likely serves as a scaffold during the silicification process. All these intricate composite structures are assumed {{to be the result of}} a coevolution between the copepod gnathobases and diatom frustules in an evolutionary arms race. The composites very likely increase both the performance of the siliceous teeth and their resistance to mechanical damage, and it is conceivable that their development has favoured the copepods’ dominance of the <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> observed today...|$|R

Feeding experiments were conducted upon four zooplankton species; Acartia tonsa, Porcellanid larvae, Calanus helgolandicus and Oithona similis. Exposure to microplastic particles resulted in an energy deficit in all species {{with the exception of}} O. similis when feeding upon a natural assemblage of algae for 24 hours, though this was only statistically significant for A. tonsa exposed to a mixture of 10 μm and 20 μm Polystyrene spheres (100 particles mL- 1). Zooplankton displayed altered feeding behaviour. High-speed video analysis allowed for the mechanisms of microplastic detection, capture and subsequent rejection or ingestion to be observed. It was found that long-range chemodetection is unlikely to occur; rather cells are detected upon contact with setae. Individuals appear to reject microplastic particles in response to the physical properties of microplastic particles. These studies provide fundamental information on the ingestion and biological effects of microplastic debris upon zooplankton, knowledge of which is important given the key role that zooplankton play in the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels and, thus, ecosystem function. These findings provide pathways for further research and highlight the influence that feeding strategy and prey selectivity may have in determining the negative effects associated with microplastic uptake...|$|R

Wax esters are the dominant lipid class in most calanoid copepods and trans-esterification results in a high fatty alcohol content in the analytical extract. Current procedures for the separation and purification of lipid classes by preparative thin-layer chromatography are time-consuming and are subject to low recovery of the analytes. In this method, fatty acid methyl esters and fatty alcohols were separated by liquid chromatography using silica or honded amino-silica as the stationary phase. The procedure is equally applicable {{to the analysis of}} zooplankton with low wax ester (and hence fatty alcohol) content, for example, a number of species of euphausiid and, generally, for samples of low mass...|$|R
5000|$|Praunus flexuosus lives {{along the}} coast of the north Atlantic Ocean between 40° north and 71° north, and in the Baltic Sea. There is only one {{doubtful}} record from further south than Roscoff. It is [...] "the only documented non-native <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> species established on the East Coast North America". It was first discovered in North America in 1960, {{on the north side of}} Cape Cod, and has since colonised as far north as Nova Scotia. This colonisation may have occurred after P. flexuosus was transported as a fouling animal on ships' hulls during the Second World War. It was only discovered around the coast of Iceland in 1970, but has since proved to be common along Iceland's south-west coast. This introduction may also have been facilitated by wartime convoys (see Battle of the Atlantic).|$|R
40|$|A new {{perspective}} {{on the role of}} lipids in zooplankton is proposed, with solid–liquid phase transitions of lipids being a factor regulating their buoyancy. These phase transitions are controlled by zooplankton in relation to their physical environment, through the selective accumulation of specific lipids with optimum levels of unsaturation. The necessity to control buoyancy and maintain an optimum depth is a fundamental evolutionary force, driving anatomical, biochemical and behavioural adaptations of all organisms within the aquatic realm. It is hypothesized that each species adjusts the amount, composition and anatomical location of lipids, to maximize fitness according to their preferred habitat and life history traits. Recent discoveries regarding the role of phase transitions of lipids in <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> and their role in regulating buoyancy will require re-interpretation of existing data and stimulate future scientific endeavours in zooplankton research...|$|R
30|$|MUFA was {{the second}} most {{abundant}} fatty acids, with highest values for oleic acid (Table  2). This is in agreement with findings in copepod (Olivotto et al. 2010), Acetes (Montaño et al. 2001) and fish fatty acid profiles (Elsdon 2010; Huynh and Kitts 2009; Sahena et al. 2009; Sirot et al. 2008). Oleic MUFA is naturally occurring in large concentrations in many marine organisms, which can also synthesise this MUFA de novo (Sargent et al. 2002). High proportions of MUFAs of marine predators are generally derived from <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton</b> (Pond & Tarling 2011; Pond et al. 2012). In the present study, we did not conduct fatty acid analyses for potential prey organisms. Nevertheless, the higher level of MUFAs found in Abudefduf bengalensis and A. sexfasciatus suggest that the fish might feed copepod as one of potential prey organism during the life history.|$|R
40|$|Diatoms are {{generally}} known for superior mechanical properties of their mineralised shells. Nevertheless, many copepod crustaceans {{are able to}} crush such shells using their mandibles. This ability very likely requires feeding tools with specific material compositions and properties. For mandibles of several copepod species silica-containing parts called opal teeth have been described. The present study reveals the existence of complex composite structures, which contain, in addition to silica, the soft and elastic protein resilin and form opal teeth with a rubber-like bearing in the mandibles of the copepod Centropages hamatus. These composite structures likely increase {{the efficiency of the}} opal teeth while simultaneously reducing the risk of mechanical damage. They are supposed to have coevolved with the diatom shells in the evolutionary arms race, and their development might have been the basis for the dominance of the copepods within today's <b>marine</b> <b>zooplankton...</b>|$|R
