50|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> {{can also}} form in store-bought vinegar {{if there is}} some non-fermented sugar and/or alcohol {{contained}} in the vinegar. This is more common in unpasteurized vinegar. While not appetizing in appearance, <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> is completely harmless and the surrounding vinegar {{does not have to be}} discarded because of it. It can be filtered out using a coffee filter, used to start a bottle of vinegar, or simply ignored.|$|E

50|$|Vinegar eels (Turbatrix aceti), {{a form of}} nematode, {{may occur}} in some forms of vinegar unless the vinegar is kept covered. These feed on the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> and can occur in {{naturally}} fermenting vinegar.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> is a {{substance}} {{composed of a}} form of cellulose and acetic acid bacteria that develops on fermenting alcoholic liquids, which turns alcohol into acetic acid {{with the help of}} oxygen from the air. It is added to wine, cider, or other alcoholic liquids to produce vinegar. <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> is also known as Mycoderma aceti, a New Latin expression, from the Greek μὑκης ("fungus") plus δἐρμα ("skin"), and the Latin aceti ("of the acid"). [...] The naming of the bacteria has been rather fluid due to its original identification near the inception of bacteriology. Currently, the preferred naming is Acetobacter aceti.|$|E
50|$|Turbatrix aceti (vinegar eels, vinegar nematode) are {{free-living}} nematodes {{that feed}} on the microbial culture, called <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> used to create vinegar, and {{may be found in}} unfiltered vinegar.

50|$|Apple {{cider vinegar}} {{is made from}} cider or apple must, and has a brownish-gold color. It is {{sometimes}} sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> present, as a natural product. It can be diluted with fruit juice or water or sweetened (usually with honey) for consumption.|$|E
50|$|Apple cider vinegar, {{otherwise}} known as cider vinegar or ACV, {{is a type of}} vinegar made from cider or apple must and has a pale to medium amber color. Unpasteurized or organic ACV contains <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar,</b> which has a cobweb-like appearance and can make the vinegar look slightly congealed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{kombucha}} {{culture is}} a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), similar to <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar,</b> containing one or more species each of bacteria and yeasts, which form a zoogleal mat known as a [...] "mother." [...] The cultures may contain {{one or more of}} the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Candida stellata, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Zygosaccharomyces bailii.|$|E
50|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>vinegars</b> {{obtained}} by bacterial or chemical oxidation of ethanol {{resulting from the}} fermentation of various sugars can be identified by the 2H-SNIF-NMR. It allows to control the quality <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> and to determine if it comes from sugar cane, wine, malt, cider, and alcohol or from a chemical synthesis.|$|R

50|$|Commercial vinegar is {{produced}} either by a fast or a slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods {{are used in}} traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly {{over the course of}} a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> (bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced between 20 hours to three days.|$|E
5000|$|A SCOBY (for {{symbiotic}} {{culture of}} bacteria and yeast) is a syntrophic mixed culture, generally associated with kombucha production wherein anaerobic ethanol fermentation (by yeast), anaerobic organic acid fermentation (by bacteria), and aerobic ethanol oxidation to acetate (by bacteria) all take place concurrently along an oxygen gradient. A gelatinous, cellulose-based biofilm called a pellicle forms at the air-liquid interface {{and is also}} {{sometimes referred to as}} a SCOBY. Either samples of this pellicle or unpasteurized kombucha can be used similarly to <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> to begin fermentation in pasteurized sweet tea. Referring to the cultures as a [...] "colony" [...] is misleading, because the term colony implies a group of genetically identical or nearly identical organisms living together. The species comprising the mixed cultures vary from preparation to preparation, but generally include Acetobacter bacterial species, as well as various Saccharomyces and other yeast types. SCOBY cultures used in beverage production can produce a structure referred to as a [...] "mushroom," [...] which is also biologically misleading, because mushrooms are a completely unrelated group of fungi. It often forms in vinegar in jars of pickled foods.|$|E

When they are found at the border of water and land they become algae. When they germinate in elevated places they become plantain. When the plantain is found in fertile soil it becomes crow's foot. The crow's foot's roots become scarab grubs and its leaves become butterflies. The butterflies soon evolve into insects that are born beneath the stove. They have the appearance of exuviae and are called [...] "house crickets:" [...] After a thousand days the house crickets become birds called [...] "dried surplus bones."

40|$|The {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> {{depends on}} an oxidation {{process that is}} mainly performed by acetic acid bacteria. Despite the different methods <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> production (more or less designated as either “fast” or “traditional”), the use of pure starter cultures remains {{far from being a}} reality. Uncontrolled mixed cultures are normally used, but this review proposes the use of controlled mixed cultures. The acetic acid bacteria species determine the quality <b>of</b> <b>vinegar,</b> although the final quality is a combined result of technological process, wood contact, and aging. This discussion centers on wine vinegar and evaluates the effects of these different processes on its chemical and sensory properties...|$|R

The influence of organic loading rate (OLR) and effluent recirculation on AD performance <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> residue was tested. Five OLRs, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 g(vs) L- 1 d(- 1), were used. The highest volumetric methane productivity of 581. 88 mL L- 1 was achieved at OLR of 2. 5 g(vs) L- 1 d(- 1). Effluent reflux ratio was set as 50 %, {{the results showed that}} effluent recirculation could effectively neutralize the acidity <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> residue, raise the pH of the feedstock, and enhance the buffering capacity of the AD system. Anaerobic digestion <b>of</b> <b>vinegar</b> residue could be a promising way not only for converting this waste into gas energy but also alleviating environmental pollution which might be useful for future industrial application.

40|$|This study evaluatesthe {{effects of}} temperature, <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>vinegar,</b> {{and amount of}} sugaron the {{fermentation}} of black chokeberry (Aroniamelanocarpa). To investigate temperature, samples of black chokeberrieswere compared after fermentation in a thermostat incubator (T 40 ᵒC) and at room temperature (T 25 ᵒC). Six mothers of vinegar were also used: white grape vinegar, brown rice black vinegar (pomegranate), brown rice black vinegar (blackberry and blueberry), pomegranate vinegar, brown rice vinegar, and white rice vinegar. The amounts of sugar were 150 g and 350 g. The fermentation is divided into periods of alcoholic fermentation and vinegar fermentation. Evaluations were done by analyzing the pH value, Brix development, and microbial visual observation. The development of pH and sugar content in the vinegar influence the general bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in the early fermentation stage, while they influence the yeast {{in the second period}} of fermentation. The samples were also analyzed under microscope, whichshowed that the black chokeberries predominantly contained Gram-negative bacteria. The quality of the vinegar is greatly affected by the storage temperature. The suitable temperature for fermentation wasdetermined to be 40 °C...|$|E
