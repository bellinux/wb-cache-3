50|$|The Admiralty Fire Control Clock (AFCC) was a {{simplified}} {{version of the}} AFCT and {{was used for the}} local control of main armament and primary control of secondary armament of battleships and cruisers, and the main armament of destroyers and other small vessels. Some smaller cruisers also used the AFCC for main armament control.

50|$|In 1914, {{the methods}} of {{correcting}} firing data for the actual conditions were often convoluted, {{and the availability of}} data about actual conditions was rudimentary or non-existent, the assumption was that fire would always be ranged (adjusted). British heavy artillery worked energetically to progressively solve all these problems from late 1914 onwards, and by early 1918, had effective processes in place for both field and heavy artillery. These processes enabled 'map-shooting', later called 'predicted fire'; it meant that effective fire could be delivered against an accurately located target without ranging. Nevertheless, the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> was still some tens of yards from the target-centre aiming point. It was not precision fire, but it was good enough for concentrations and barrages. These processes remain in use into the 21st Century with refinements to calculations enabled by computers and improved data capture about non-standard conditions.|$|E
50|$|An {{implication}} of indirect fire and improving guns was increasing range between gun and target, this increased {{the time of}} flight and the vertex of the trajectory. The result was decreasing accuracy (the increasing distance between the target and the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> of the shells aimed at it) caused by the increasing effects of non-standard conditions. Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity, zero wind, air temperature and density, and propellant temperature. In practice, this standard combination of conditions almost never existed, they varied throughout the day and day to day, and the greater the time of flight, the greater the inaccuracy. An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide accurate orientation for the guns. Of course, targets had to be accurately located, but by 1916, air photo interpretation techniques enabled this, and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} program, it was desired {{to better understand the}} impact of the rotating chamber alignment with the barrel throat on the precision and accuracy of a novel cased telescoped (CT) ammunition firing rifle. In order to perform the study, a baseline CT ammunition chamber which was concentric with a Mann barrel bore was manufactured. Additionally, six chambers were manufactured with an offset relative to the barrel bore. These chambers were used to simulate a misaligned chamber relative to the bore axis. Precision and accuracy tests were then performed at 200 [*]m in an indoor range under controlled conditions. For this project, 5. 56 [*]mm CT ammunition was used. As the chamber axis offset relative to the gun bore was increased, the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> was displaced away from the target center. The shift in the impact location is explained by the presence of in-bore yaw which results in lateral throw-off and aerodynamic jump components. The linear theory of ballistics is used to establish a relationship between the chamber misalignment and the resulting projectile <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> for a rifle developed to fire CT ammunition. This relationship allows for the prediction of the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> given a chamber misalignment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the methodologies that predict the trajectory {{and accuracy of}} an unguided, indirect-fire launched projectile in predicted fire. The trajectory is the path that a projectile travels to the impact point, while the accuracy is the measurement of the deviation of the impact point from the target. In addition, this thesis describes, the methodology for calculating the {{various factors such as}} drag and drift in the trajectory calculation. A three degree of freedom model will be compared to a five degree of freedom model. With an accurate trajectory prediction, it is possible to calculate the delivery accuracy in a predicted fire, which does not have cumulative error corrections associated with the registration or adjusted fire. The delivery accuracies that are considered in this thesis are; 1) <b>Mean</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impact</b> (MPI) that are related to aiming errors and 2) Precision errors that are related to the dispersion caused by ballistics effect.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Navy small arms training and qualification instruction focused on dry fire and simulators should be utilized when available. However, naval personnel {{often do not}} have access to dry fire training opportunities and therefore may be at risk for losing perishable marksmanship skills. The purpose of the study was to determine if the use of a simulator is at least as effective in marksmanship training as traditional dry fire techniques. A between-groups study with a random selection of volunteers (blocked by previous marksmanship experience) was conducted to determine if participants who completed simulation-based training showed greater improvement and retention of marksmanship skills than participants completing dry fire training. The main measures were the qualification scores, average shot group size, shot group size and <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> to center zeroing point length. The experiment utilized a simulated M 9 Berretta for the qualification. Results demonstrate that simulation training improved performance on the seven-yard line to a greater extent than current naval training. Exploratory analyses suggest that simulation training may be most beneficial for less-experienced shooters, and that a minimum of two weeks' time is needed to detect group differences in the retention of skills.

40|$|The use of {{simulation}} {{to train}} watchstanders in marksmanship {{would provide a}} valuable and flexible training asset to the Navy, resulting in minimal lost training opportunities due to operational commitments at sea. We hypothesized that (1) simulation-based marksmanship training would transfer to live fire better than dry fire training, and (2) the experimental (simulation) group {{would have a better}} chance of retaining their marksmanship skills than the control group after two or four weeks with no instruction. Thirty-four active duty military volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either simulation training using the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer (ISMT) or standard naval marksmanship training and given either a two- or four-week gap between training and final live fire events. Main measures of marksmanship performance were <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> (MPI) of group shots and scores on the standard Navy Handgun Qualification Course. Results partially supported the hypotheses. The simulation group showed greater improvement in MPI than the control group from baseline to live fire. However, no significant differences were found between the two- and four-week gaps in either case tested, suggesting a longer time gap is needed to test skill retention. Results suggest that simulation training is as effective as standard navy marksmanship training and would benefit the Navy to incorporate ISMT as an at-sea marksmanship trainer.

5000|$|This table {{demonstrates}} that, {{even with}} a fairly aerodynamic bullet fired at high velocity, the [...] "bullet drop" [...] or change in the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> is significant. This change in <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> has two important implications. Firstly, estimating {{the distance to the}} target is critical at longer ranges, because the difference in the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> between 400 and 500 yd is 25-32&thinsp;in (depending on zero), in other words if the shooter estimates that the target is 400&thinsp;yd away when it is in fact 500&thinsp;yd away the shot will impact 25-32&thinsp;in (635-813&thinsp;mm) below where it was aimed, possibly missing the target completely. Secondly, the rifle should be zeroed to a distance appropriate to the typical range of targets, because the shooter might have to aim so far above the target to compensate for a large bullet drop that he may lose sight of the target completely (for instance being outside the field of view of a telescopic sight). In the example of the rifle zeroed at 200 yd, the shooter would have to aim 49&thinsp;in or more than 4&thinsp;ft (1.2&thinsp;m) above the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> for a target at 500&thinsp;yd.|$|R
