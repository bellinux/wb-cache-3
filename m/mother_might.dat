On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his <b>mother</b> <b>might</b> not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E

Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real <b>mother</b> <b>might</b> be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we assess the role of employment-based health {{insurance}} offers in explaining the motherhood wage gap. Researchers {{have been aware of}} the existence of a motherhood gap for many years; yet, the literature has failed to address the role of non-wage compensation in explaining the motherhood wage gap despite the increasing importance of non-wage benefits in total compensation packages. As hedonic wage theory suggests, <b>mothers</b> <b>might</b> view health benefits as desirable and trade-off wages for health insurance. Thus, lower wages for <b>mothers</b> <b>might</b> reflect their relative preferences for jobs offering health insurance. We estimate an endogenous switching wage equation model to account for the self-selection and, thus, endogeneity of having an employment-based health insurance offer. We find that, once the endogeneity of having an employment-based health insurance offer is accounted for, the motherhood wage gap disappears. motherhood wage gap, non-wage compensation, health insurance...|$|R

2500|$|The Gemara recounted a {{discussion}} regarding {{the right of}} the firstborn in [...] Once Rabbi Jannai was walking, leaning on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai his attendant, and Rabbi Judah the Prince came to meet them. Rabbi Judah the Prince asked Rabbi Jannai what the Scriptural basis was for the proposition that a son takes precedence over a daughter in the inheritance of a mother's estate. Rabbi Jannai replied that the plural use of the term [...] "tribes" [...] in the discussion of the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad in [...] indicates that the mother's tribe is to be compared to the father's tribe, and {{as in the case of}} the father's tribe, a son takes precedence over a daughter, so in the case of the mother's tribe, a son should take precedence over a daughter. Rabbi Judah the Prince challenged Rabbi Jannai, saying that if it this were so, one could say that as in the case of the father's tribe, a firstborn takes a double portion, so in the case of the mother's tribe would a firstborn take a double portion. Rabbi Jannai dismissed the remark of Rabbi Judah the Prince. The Gemara then inquired why it is true that a firstborn son takes a double share in his father's estate but not his mother's. Abaye replied that [...] says, [...] "of all that he [...] has," [...] implying all that [...] "he" [...] (the father) has and not all that [...] "she" [...] (the mother) has. The Gemara asked whether the proposition that a firstborn son takes a double portion only in the estate of his father might apply only in the case where a bachelor married a widow (who had children from her first marriage, and thus the father's firstborn son was not that of the mother). And thus where a bachelor married a virgin (so that the firstborn son of the father would also be the firstborn son of the <b>mother)</b> <b>might</b> the firstborn son also take a double portion in his mother’s estate? Rav Nahman bar Isaac replied that [...] says, [...] "for he [...] is the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] from which we can infer that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not the first-fruits of the mother’s strength. The Gemara replied that [...] teaches that though a son was born after a miscarriage (and thus did not [...] "open the womb" [...] and is not regarded as a firstborn son for purposes of [...] "sanctification to the Lord" [...] and [...] "redemption from the priest" [...] in [...] ) he is nonetheless regarded as the firstborn son for purposes of inheritance. [...] thus implies that only the son for whom the father's heart grieves is included in the law, but a miscarriage, for which the father's heart does not grieve, is excluded. (And thus, since [...] is necessary for this deduction, it could not have been meant for the proposition that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not of the mother’s strength.) But then the Gemara reasoned that if [...] is necessary for excluding miscarriages, then [...] should have read, [...] "for he is the first-fruits of strength," [...] but [...] in fact says, [...] "his strength." [...] Thus one may deduce two laws from [...] But the Gemara objected further that still that the words of [...] "the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] not her strength, might apply only to the case of a widower (who had children from his first wife) who married a virgin (since the first son from the second marriage would be only the wife's firstborn, not the husband’s). But where a bachelor married a virgin (and thus the son would be the firstborn of both the father and the mother), the firstborn son might take a double portion also in his mother’s estate. But Raba concluded that [...] states, [...] "{{the right of the}} firstborn is his ," [...] and this indicates that the right of the firstborn applies to a man’s estate and not to a woman’s.–b2.
