40|$|This thesis {{determined}} {{the feasibility of}} developing a 16 -inch, gun-launched anti-satellite weapon. The general performance capability of rocket-and scramjet-boosted, gun-launched vehicles is examined with regards to propelling a <b>miniature</b> <b>homing</b> <b>vehicle</b> to a satellite intercept altitude. Rocket and scramjet boost vehicle performance is modeled and optimum trajectories are determined. A low gun elevation at launch and a pop-up manuever are required to maximize the scramjet boost vehicle acceleration potential. The rocket boost vehicle is capable of intercepting a low altitude satellite without a pop-up manuever from a gun elevation of 45 degrees. Both boost methods provide apogees consistent with the intercept of known Soviet Electronic Intelligence Ocean Reconnaissance satellites, EORSAT, and Radar Ocean Reconnaissance satellites, RORSAT...|$|E

Navigation relies on acceleration data, gyroscopic data, and global positioning data. This maximizes distance by minimizing corrective maneuvers that waste flight energy.|$|R

Our {{objective is}} to design a <b>miniature</b> <b>homing</b> device capable of tracking external tags placed on any object. Also, the tracking device {{will be able to}} notify the user when the tagged object is a certain distance away from the receiver, such as when the object is stolen or forgotten. This proposal will provide an overview of our product, a description of our design as well as existing solutions, a tentative projected budget, our sources of funding and information, and a discussion of our project's time schedule and team organization. In addition, the market potential estimate of our product will be provided. MicroTrak Inc. consists of five enthusiastic, dedicated, fourth-year engineering students...|$|R
5000|$|Hamilton Family KidZooU & Farris Family Education Center: Formerly the Pachyderm House, this children's zoo {{is divided}} between {{indoor and outdoor}} {{exhibits}} and is open all year. Outdoor exhibits put the emphasis on rare breeds, including Arapawa goat, Jacob sheep, <b>miniature</b> horses, <b>homing</b> pigeons, chickens, and ducks. There {{is an opportunity for}} animal petting in the contact yard, as well as duck feedings and shows highlighting animal training. Indoor exhibits put an emphasis on energy conservation and animal empathy through games, parallel play, and live animal exhibits. Animals found here include butterflies, reef fish, Panamanian golden frogs, budgies, ants, fancy rats, and a chick hatchery. Found throughout KidZooU are areas appropriate for very young children and quiet spaces.|$|R
40|$|Toxicity {{resulting}} from systemic administration continues {{to limit the}} effectiveness of modern chemotherapeutics. Administered drugs and biologics damage vital organs via off target effects while in circulation, decreasing the maximum tolerated dose and preventing the use of more effective drug concentrations. Many therapeutic agents are additionally constrained by a narrow therapeutic index, requiring delicate balance between toxicity and loss of efficacy. With dose remaining a critical determinant of efficacy, the inability to utilize increased drug concentrations due to toxicity prevents the full exploitation of the drug’s therapeutic effect. While exploitation of the enhanced permeability and retention effect has been somewhat successful in targeting nanoparticles to tumors via passive accumulation, elevated tumor pressure and poor drug penetrance prevent a significant improvement in therapeutic effect. Here we describe the conjugation of polymer prodrugs to tumor homing mesenchymal stem cells as a novel approach to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. The utilization of an actively <b>homing</b> cellular <b>vehicle</b> for effective drug delivery against the pressure gradient {{has the potential to}} improve drug penetration of the tumor while reducing systemic toxicity and improving drug efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Boost-phase {{ballistic}} missile defense is alluring because rocket boosters are easy to detect and track, they are relatively vulnerable due to the large axial loads on a missile under powered flight, the entire payload (single or multiple warheads and midcourse penetration aids) may be destroyed in a single shot, and countermeasures to defeat boostphase defense {{are more difficult to}} devise than for midcourse {{ballistic missile}} defenses. Moreover, if intercepted several seconds before booster burnout, the debris will land well short of the target area, although collateral damage to other territory is a serious concern. On the other hand, boost-phase {{ballistic missile defense}} is technically challenging because the intercept timelines are very short (1 – 3 minutes for theater-range ballistic missiles and 3 – 5 minutes for intercontinental range missiles) and missile boosters are accelerating targets, thus complicating the design of <b>homing</b> kinetic-kill <b>vehicles</b> (KKVs). This article examines the technical feasibility and nominal capability of one type of boost-phase defense, namely, airborne boost-phase intercept (ABI). Airborne laser systems are not examined here. 1 This article concludes that ABI should be technically achievable within the next decade and that airborne platforms offer some unique advantages, especially for theater ballistic missile defense, that warrant their serious consideration in future U. S. missile defense architectures. The advantages of boost-phase ballistic missile defense animated President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. However, unlike boost-phase defense against Russian ICBMs, boost-phase defense against emerging ballistic-missil...|$|R
