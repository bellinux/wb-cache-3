50|$|Bubalus murrensis, the European water buffalo, is an extinct Bovine {{that lived}} in Europe during the Pleistocene. Its closest living {{relatives}} are the Wild Asian water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), the Tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), the Lowland anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), the <b>Mountain</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus quarlesi) and the domestic water bufallo (Bubalus bubalis).|$|E
50|$|Anoa, {{also known}} as midget buffalo and sapiutan, are a {{subgenus}} of Bubalus comprising two species native to Indonesia: the <b>mountain</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus quarlesi) and the lowland anoa (Bubalus depressicornis). Both live in undisturbed rainforest, and are essentially miniature water buffalo. They are similar in appearance to a deer, weighing 150 - 300 kg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus quarlesi) {{are also}} known as anoa de montana, anoa de Quarle, anoa des montagnes, anoa pegunungan, and Quarle's anoa. Standing at 70 cm at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the lowland anoa and the {{smallest}} of all wild cattle. They also have longer, woolier hair that moults every February to April, showing faint spots on the head, neck, and limbs.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{information}} in relation to kind of forest plants which were usually consumed by <b>mountain</b> <b>anoa</b> in its natural habitat and community area around the forest, and to estimate energy and nutrient requirements for maintenance and growth of anoa. This study was conducted in Province of Central Sulawesi using six anoas. Digestal analysis method was used to study kind of forest plants in the rumen of anoas. Cafetaria system was used to obtain information related to the dry matter intake of forest plants. Regression analysis was used to estimate energy and nutrient requirements of anoa. The results showed that anoa consumed Ficus vasculosa Rump (fruits), Cyperus sp. (leaves), Ficus sp. (shoots), Brachiaria mutica (leaves) and Ipomea aquatica Fordk (leaves and stems). The dry matter intake of these feeds were 29. 1 ± 8. 5, 16. 5 ± 3. 8, 14. 2 ± 2. 8, 7. 6 ± 1. 7 and 4. 8 ± 0. 6 g/kg W 0. 75, respectively. The energy and nutrient requirements of anoa for maintenance based on g/kg W 0. 75 were 22 g TDN, 6. 3 g protein, 0. 457 g Ca and 0. 427 g P. The energy and nutrient requirements of anoas for growth based on g/kg weight gain were 1333. 64 g TDN, 399. 9 g protein, 29. 38 g Ca and 26. 85 g P...|$|E
