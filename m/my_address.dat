2500|$|So notorious {{did their}} {{activities}} become that I learned when I first went {{away from home}} that when I had to give <b>my</b> <b>address</b> as [...] "Cosby," [...] I {{should be ready to}} say, [...] "Yes, they make it up there." ...|$|E
2500|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. [...] "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took <b>my</b> <b>address</b> down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more." ...|$|E
2500|$|You {{call me a}} {{protagonist of}} the scheme called [...] "Pakistan". Now Pakistan is not my scheme. (Iqbal is here, {{referring}} to Ch. Rehmat Ali's scheme of Pakistan) The one that I suggested in <b>my</b> <b>address</b> {{is the creation of}} a Muslim Province â€“ i.e.; a province having an overwhelming population of Muslims in the North-West of India. This new province will be, according to my scheme, a part of the proposed Indian Federation. Pakistan scheme (i.e., scheme of Ch. Rahmat Ali) proposes a separate federation of Muslim Provinces directly related to England as a separate dominion. This scheme originated in Cambridge. The authors of this scheme believe that we Muslim Round Tablers have sacrificed the Muslim nation on the altar of Hindu or the so called Indian Nationalism.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, {{upon the}} sand, Claude Locker {{approached}} Olive. [...] "Would {{you like to}} decline <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> for the second time?" [...] he abruptly asked.|$|R
60|$|Wild. I {{think we}} shall {{do well to}} put it to an issue: {{this is the last}} time you shall ever be troubled with <b>my</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{ask your}} {{permission}} to pay <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to Miss Sherwin--or, to be plainer still, if you like, {{to ask of}} you her hand in marriage." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>address,</b> when I am in London, is at {{the head}} of this page.|$|E
60|$|After {{presenting}} the usual professions of servitude, &c., in the customary manner, <b>my</b> <b>address</b> is presented.|$|E
60|$|HOTEL DES ILES D'OR, BUT <b>MY</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> WILL BE CHALET LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LE-PALMIERS, VAR, FRANCE, MARCH 17, 1883.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{had ever}} been {{engaged to be married}} before,' he went on, 'I expect your opinion of <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> would be different. But then, I should not----' ...|$|R
60|$|MISS HENRIETTA. Mr. Blades, I {{have been}} saying that if I were a gentleman I would pay <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to Miss Phoebe much rather than to her niece.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{the money}} and other things," [...] he said, {{gathering}} courage. [...] "I hinted to you then that I hoped in certain contingencies {{to be allowed to}} make <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to you, and I think that you understood me." ...|$|R
60|$|The letter {{ended with}} {{an apology for}} delay in writing to me, caused by {{difficulty}} in discovering <b>my</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
60|$|I left <b>my</b> <b>address</b> with him, {{and sure}} enough, {{he turned up}} at the office {{the next morning at}} seven o'clock precisely.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. As regards {{readjustment}} of taxation, he is contented {{with the}} [...] terms of <b>my</b> <b>address,</b> and indisposed {{to make any}} new terms.|$|E
6000|$|My son Gildart married Miss Puff, and {{ultimately}} became a {{commander in the}} navy. My wife's strength of mind gave way before increasing years, and she finally became as gentle as she was when I first paid <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose I {{must leave}} you {{to speak in}} soliloquy if you choose,' she replied, after a pause that seemed an angry one. 'It is useless <b>my</b> <b>addressing</b> myself to a rash and headstrong old man who has a set purpose not to hear me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE. Well, it's all over. I've been refused---scorned. I'm {{only here}} on sufferance. You understand: it's all over. Your sister {{is in no}} sense {{entertaining}} <b>my</b> <b>addresses,</b> or condescending to interest herself in me in any way. (Gloria, satisfied, turns back contemptuously to the window.) Is that clear? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{will send}} you <b>my</b> <b>address</b> as soon as I am sure of it, or you can always write me to the theatre.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} how he had got <b>my</b> <b>address,</b> and on that problem light was immediately cast by Mrs. Medley, who returned, bearing an envelope.|$|E
60|$|Thus he spoke, mimicking, I have {{no doubt}} (for he {{had a sense of}} humour), the manner of <b>my</b> <b>address,</b> which {{nervousness}} had made somewhat pompous.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} nothing {{the matter with}} her health, because there is nothing. But, Mr. Melbury, I have seen your {{daughter}} several times by accident. I have admired her infinitely, and I was coming {{to ask you if}} I may become better acquainted with her--pay <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, sir," [...] he said; [...] "I am in {{love with}} your daughter. She's one and twenty, and I want to see her--and in fact----" [...] He {{found it hard to}} express himself. He could think only of a phrase that sounded ridiculous. [...] "I want--in fact--to pay <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucilla's letter {{will have}} told you that I have come to my senses, and that I am again paying <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> to her as her affianced husband. My {{principal}} object in adding these lines is to propose that we should forget the past, and go on again {{as if nothing had}} happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{could do}} neither the one nor the other, Helena. Miss Chance will never find out <b>my</b> <b>address</b> again; I have taken {{good care of}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Begum Saib of exalted {{dignity and}} generosity, whom God preserve! [...] After {{presenting}} the usual professions of servitude, &c., in the [...] customary manner, <b>my</b> <b>address</b> is presented.|$|E
60|$|So I {{give him}} the five francs, and explain my little scheme of making it a loan, and not a gift; and then I give him <b>my</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot find a {{suitable}} form of expression," [...] said Lucian, in painful perplexity. [...] "I {{am sure you}} will not attribute any sordid motive to my--well, to <b>my</b> <b>addresses,</b> though the term seems absurd. I am too well aware that there is little, from the usual point of view, to tempt you to unite yourself to me. Still--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawrence had {{no answer}} to make to this, {{but it was not}} easy to turn him from his purpose. [...] "Excuse me, sir," [...] he said, [...] "but I think a matter of this sort should be left to the lady. If she is not {{inclined}} to receive <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> she will say so, and there is an end of it." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. Certainly: I'll confess. I'm in {{love with}} Miss Craven--always have been; and I've persecuted her with <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> ever since I knew her. It's been no use: she utterly despises me. A moment ago the {{spectacle}} of a rival's happiness stung {{me to make a}} nasty, sneering speech; and she--well, she just shook me a little, as you saw.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} whilst {{the memory}} of it all is wonderful," [...] she declared. [...] "Come. Here's a card with <b>my</b> <b>address</b> on. Drive me home now, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here," [...] I said, opening my card-case, [...] "is <b>my</b> <b>address</b> in this place; and here," [...] I went on, {{producing}} the document, [...] "is my passport, {{if they want}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Thank {{you again}} and again. You {{have made me}} so happy: I know you will admire him and like him. This is <b>my</b> <b>address.</b> [She gives him her card].|$|E
6000|$|But let {{me to my}} story: I must own, [...] If I {{have any}} fault, it is digression-- [...] Leaving my people to proceed alone, [...] While I soliloquize beyond expression; [...] But these are <b>my</b> <b>addresses</b> from the throne, [...] Which put off {{business}} to the ensuing session: [...] Forgetting each omission is a loss to [...] The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} my daughter's evidence," [...] he said, politely, but yet with an air {{calculated}} to prevent <b>my</b> <b>addressing</b> myself to Diana, [...] "since I am prepared to believe all that is worthy of Mr. Francis Osbaldistone. Permit us now to retire; we must take repose when we can, since we are absolutely uncertain when we may {{be called upon to}} renew our perilous journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said King Thothmes, {{with more}} geniality in his tone, [...] "there {{can be no}} impropriety in <b>my</b> <b>addressing</b> you personally. Will you take a place at our table next to myself, and we can {{converse}} together without interrupting a banquet which must be brief enough in any circumstances? Hatasou, my dear, you may seat yourself next to the barbarian prince." ...|$|R
