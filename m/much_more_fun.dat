[...] David Wild of the Guilford County, North Carolina News & Record called [...] "Love and Understanding", [...] "Save Up All Your Tears" [...] and [...] "Could've Been You" [...] "strong tracks" [...] that [...] "show that she is still an effective pop singer". The review of the Worcester, Massachusetts Telegram & Gazette newspaper noted [...] "Cher attempts to display her sexual prowess on the song, ...a great vehicle for her, an 'in-your-face' song directed to a former lover".|$|E

She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P.D.James' Devices and Desires. Also that year, she appeared as a young woman engaging in a forbidden affair with a Nazi officer in the Hallmark film One Against the Wind. In 1992 she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in Rachel’s Dream, a 30‑minute Channel4 short, and in 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's just so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to play... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade." ...|$|E

Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It was something you hadn’t seen, or wanted to see or wondered about, so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> puzzle." [...] Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that [...] "Each year we’ve tried to reinvent the series in some way ... I think the end [...] really does suggest something quite different." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
5000|$|The A.V. Club {{was less}} favourable, saying Remedy was [...] "nowhere near as revolutionary as the hype would insinuate", though noting {{that it does}} [...] "offer its {{distinct}} pleasures."

5000|$|In an interview, Abrams {{talked about}} {{the failure of the}} show: [...] "I’ve got to say, I feel like it was unfortunate. Of course, I {{completely}} blame myself for the entire thing. The conceit of the show was to do a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frivolous, <b>fun</b> show, but ultimately, I think it was just too frivolous and too simple, and we didn’t go deep enough. We were really desperately trying to stay away from mythology and complexity and intensity and too much serious, dark storytelling and, ultimately, that’s not necessarily what I do best. I think audiences felt that {{it was a little bit}} lacking. I see that and completely take responsibility for its failing." ...|$|R

[...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show.

2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E

Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in and tell them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur to snuff out the light are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine.
