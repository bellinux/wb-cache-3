5|$|Nuyts died on 11 December 1655 and {{was buried}} in a churchyard in Hulst. The {{tombstone}} remained until 1983, when it was destroyed during renovations of the church. After his funeral {{it was discovered that}} he had collected <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> from his estates than he had handed over to the authorities; his son Pieter eventually repaid his father's debts. It was the younger Pieter who also arranged the posthumous publication of his father's treatise Lof des Elephants, in 1670 — a single known copy of which still exists, in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Introducing <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> {{proved to}} be hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E

25|$|In 1828, the {{population}} surpassed 7,000 and Louisville became Kentucky's first city. John Bucklin was elected the first Mayor. The nearby towns of Shippingport and Portland remained independent of Louisville {{for the time}} being.

25|$|A new {{flat rate}} {{corporation}} tax of 25 per cent payable {{on the profits}} of corporate commercial entities has been introduced. This rate replaces the old corporation tax of 10 per cent and progressive rates of income tax (12-54 per cent) on reserves and distributable income. Apart from the 25 per cent corporation tax and the 0.3 per cent Chamber of Commerce tax no <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> will be payable by the corporate entity or the shareholders.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{inclusion}} of general counsel in top management {{is associated with a}} firm’s tax avoidance.

In addition, we find that among firms with general counsel in top management, tax avoidance is greater when (1) the general counsel has tax-related expertise, (2) the firm hires an external auditor with tax expertise or purchases <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> services from its external auditor, and (3) the CEO has more power over the general counsel...|$|R
25|$|Penn did {{not always}} pay {{attention}} to details, and had not taken the fairly simple step of determining where the 40th degree of latitude (the southern boundary of his land under the charter) actually was. After he sent letters to several landowners in Maryland advising the recipients that they were probably in Pennsylvania and not to pay any <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> to Lord Baltimore, trouble arose between the two proprietors. This led to an eighty-year legal dispute between the two families.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E
25|$|Mount Allison's origins however {{go back to}} a boys' academy {{founded in}} June 1839 by a local Methodist merchant, Charles Frederick Allison. Charles Allison's {{grandfather}} had emigrated from Ireland to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession: silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, then they could certainly afford to pay <b>more</b> <b>taxes.</b> The Allisons left Ireland shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the university library.|$|E

25|$|There were roughly three {{positions}} {{on the future of}} the Dutch economy. The CDA claimed that the reforms were finished and that the following cabinet would not have to take any serious measures. The VVD wanted to continue reforming to increase the performance of the Dutch economy. They wanted to continue to cut taxes and reduce bureaucracy. The opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL, joined by the ChristianUnion wanted to revert some of the measures and pay more attention to the public sector, especially to the health care-sector and the poor. The PvdA and the GreenLeft however also announced that they wanted to reform part of the economy and welfare system. For instance several months before the elections, Wouter Bos, the leader of Labour Party, announced that he wanted to tax the elderly pension in such a way that rich elderly would pay <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> on their pensions than poor elderly. The Dutch pension system consists of government supplied (AOW) and mandatory self-saved pensions. It is the latter portion Bos wanted to tax progressively. The proposal led to considerable controversy, both outside and within Bos' own party. Former minister and de Volkskrant columnist Marcel van Dam wrote a critical column on 22 June concerning Bos' proposal. The second man of the Christian Democratic Appeal Maxime Verhagen used soundbites from the proposal continually to emphasise that the PvdA was an unreliable partner for the elderly. Bos later moderated his plans: only new cases would pay taxes over their pension.|$|E

40|$|Almost all the world's tax {{treaties}} {{are based}} on precedents found in an OECD model tax convention or a UN model tax convention.

This paper examines the use of OECD and UN precedents in the tax treaties {{of a group of}} 11 East African countries. It is difficult to see a link between reduced taxation by the capital importing countries and increased foreign investment.

In truth, John wishes to keep the revenue for himself and maintain his brother's imprisonment. Soon after, Marian is reluctantly manipulated into accompanying the Sheriff to attend a market at Nottingham Castle. There, she is kidnapped by the prisoner William [...] "Scarlet" [...] Scathlocke, an enraged man imprisoned for killing four Norman soldiers, and is taken into the depths of nearby Sherwood Forest. Lord Robert, who was taught how to navigate the massive forest as a youth, secretly tracks Scarlet and is able to secure Marian's release. While accompanying Marian back to her modest manor – Ravenskeep – Robert falls ill from a fever. Marian gradually wears down the mental wall he had built up in captivity by the Saracens, and after his recovery at Ravenskeep, they consummate their relationship soon after she refuses DeLacey's offer of marriage.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee's {{government}} also took action to increase government revenues: the 1932 budget increased corporate taxes and imposed a new {{personal income tax}} on individuals earning more than $750 per year and couples earning more than $1,500; fewer than 100 farmers in the province earned enough to pay it. [...] In 1933 he joined Bracken and Anderson in protesting to Bennett that nothing more could be done: in Brownlee's view, the province's impoverished people could not pay <b>more</b> <b>taxes,</b> and yet expectations of provincial governments were constantly growing. [...] Left to their own devices, the premiers said, {{they would have to}} either drastically cut relief payments or default on debt payments. [...] They asked that the federal government increase its share of unemployment relief from one third to one half and that it loan the provinces the money they needed to pay their share. [...] Bennett replied by chastising the premiers for not doing enough to [...] "work into a position of self-reliance" [...] and decreed that federal support would be cut off unless budget deficits were limited to $1 million. [...] In a separate letter to Brownlee, he praised him for doing [...] "better than any one of the Western Provinces" [...] but said that, in the interests of equality, he was imposing the same conditions on Alberta as on the others.|$|E
