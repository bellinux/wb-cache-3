Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue Magistrate Judge Elaine Bucklo's had made in March1992. Tillman's lawyer, James Chapman, recommended to Tillman that an immediate appeal be filed in federal court.|$|E

5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E
5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that companies <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E
5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the radio room and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E

A U.S. Army Special Intelligence unit member named Robert T. Sturgeon is sent to find Ryu to take out Ashtar. Robert informs Ryu that Irene Lew has been captured and that he <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Tower of Lahja to save her. After hopping on a freight train and then battling up the mountain in which the tower lies, he is ambushed by a figure who describes himself as a tribesman of the World of Chaos, led by the Emperor of Darkness Ashtar. After making {{it to the top of}} the tower, Ryu finds Irene, who has been captured by Ashtar. Ashtar then blasts Ryu with energy from his own sword; before Ashtar can finish off Ryu, Robert appears and shoots Ashtar in the back, stopping him. Robert orders Ashtar to hand over his sword and give up, but Ashtar escapes with Irene, telling Ryu to follow him into the Maze of Darkness.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E

25|$|Yield {{management}} is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable {{at a point}} in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{species are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for dolphin relatives {{due to their}} similar overall morphology. However, the morphological traits are convergent. Temnodontosaurus were not mammals but were large marine reptiles and their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Temnodontosaurus do have morphological traits which differ from Cetacea also. Temnodontosaurus tail would beat laterally side to side, instead of up and down. Temnodontosaurus skull's also have nostrils that are {{placed in front of}} the eyes instead of on the dorsal side of the head like Cetaceans. Though reptiles, Temnodontosaurus can also be mistaken for fish due to their fins and elongate undifferentiated body, but unlike fish Temnodontosaurus are air breathers and <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the water’s surface for air. Also Temnodontosaurus, like other Ichthyosaurs, are viviparous.|$|E
25|$|The wicket {{proved to}} be helpful to the touring side too after a similar opening (the first and second wicket – a duck – falling cheaply on 28) and another duck leaving them at 68/4 however a well-paced strike rate from Mohammad Yousuf, making a double century {{in the nick of}} time as he stood until the last wicket, and a half century from skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq, keeping his record against England alive, proved the team would stand as strong as the home team. Stephen Harmison's bowling, which had been under {{scrutiny}} over the Winter months, improved greatly at his least favourite pitch as he took 4–94 but the next best, Matthew Hoggard at 3–117 proved the tourists had victory in their sights. A special note <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Pietersen who made a rare attempt at bowling for two overs, taking wicket keeper Kamran Akmal for 58 at figures of 1–11.|$|E
