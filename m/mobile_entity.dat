40|$|Abstract. <b>Mobile</b> <b>entity</b> {{navigation}} in dynamic environments is {{an essential}} part of many mission critical applications like search and rescue and fire fighting. The dynamism of the environment necessitates the <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> to constantly maintain a high degree of awareness of the changing environment. This criteria makes it difficult to achieve good navigation performance by using just on-board sensors and existing navigation methods and motivates the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to aid navigation. In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates a roadmap based navigation algorithm with a novel WSN query protocol called Roadmap Query (RQ). RQ enables collection of frequent, up-todate information about the surrounding environment, thus allowing the <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> to make good navigation decisions. Simulation results under realistic fire scenarios show that in highly dynamic environments RQ outperforms existing approaches in both navigation performance and communication cost. We also present a mobile agent based implementation of RQ along with preliminary experimental results, on Mica 2 motes. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Developing {{applications}} with pass-by communica-tion {{is usually}} complex and expensive, since the applications heav-ily {{depend on the}} hardware to detect rendezvous (i. e., proximity) of <b>mobile</b> <b>entities.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} complexity and cost of the application development, we propose a device-independent formalization of the pass-by rendezvous of <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> in this paper. Specifically, we first define a pass-by rendezvous as a phenomenon, where two <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> are closed enough at a certain time. We then derive four properties from the definition to be satisfied within any pass-by systems. The properties allow indirect pass-by rendezvous between <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> with different devices. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two different practical systems (Bluetooth Low Energy and GPS). In the case study, we see how the pass-by rendezvous can be implemented in each system, and see how the indirect rendezvous across the two systems can be inferred using the proposed properties.

40|$|International audienceA <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> (e. g., a {{software}} agent or a robot) has {{to explore a}} graph whose nodes are unlabeled and edge ports are locally labeled at each node. The entity has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the graph or of its size. Its task is to traverse all {{the edges of the}} graph, and to stop once this is achieved. In order to perform this task, the <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> must be given the ability to put markers at nodes. We thus consider two models: the robot model specifies that the <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> (called robot) is given a pebble that can be dropped and removed at nodes; the agent model specifies that the <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> (called agent) has the ability to let messages on whiteboards available at each node. Under the robot model, we show that the robot needs Ω(nd) bits of memory to perform exploration of digraphs with n nodes and maximum out-degree d. We then describe an algorithm that allows exploration of any n-node digraph with maximum out-degree d to be accomplished by a robot with a memory of size O(ndn) bits. Under the agent model, we show that digraph exploration cannot be achieved by an agent with no memory. We then describe an exploration algorithm for an agent with a constant-size memory, using a whiteboard of size O(d) bits at every node of out-degree d. This latter algorithm shows that the data-structure used by a robot for exploration can be optimally distributed among all nodes...|$|E

In particular, exploiting the availability of a Wireless Sensor Network as an infrastructure, a <b>mobile</b> <b>entity</b> equipped with an inertial system first gets the position estimation using both a Kalman Filter and a fully distributed positioning algorithm (the Enhanced Steepest Descent, we recently proposed), then combines the results using the Simple Convex Combination algorithm.

40|$|Rapid advancements in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), and {{wireless}} communications, {{have resulted in}} a surge in data generation. Mobility data is one of the various forms of data, which are ubiquitously collected by different location sensing devices. Extensive knowledge about the behavior of humans and wildlife is buried in raw mobility data. This knowledge can be used for realizing numerous viable applications ranging from wildlife movement analysis, to various location-based recommendation systems, urban planning, and disaster relief. With respect to what mentioned above, in this thesis, we mainly focus on providing data analytics for understanding the behavior and interaction of <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> (humans and animals).

40|$|Purpose – The rapid {{proliferation}} of mobile context aware applications {{has resulted in}} an increased research interest towards developing specialized context data management strategies for <b>mobile</b> <b>entities.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to aim to develop a new way to model <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> and manage their contexts accordingly. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes the concept of “Mobile Space” to model <b>mobile</b> <b>entities</b> and presents strategies to manage the various contexts associated therein. To handle availability related issues, two system services are designed: the “Availability Updating Service” which is an identifier based mechanism and is designed to keep track of mobile objects and handle availability related issues, and the “Application Callback Service” which is a publish/subscribe based mechanism to handle application disruptions and interruptions arising due to mobility. Findings – The paper presents a detailed study of the proposed framework and a description of the underlying services and the components therein to validate the framework. Experimental results carried out in WiFi and 3 G environments indicate that the proposed techniques can support mobile applications and minimize application disruptions with minimal overhead. Originality/value – The proposed context management framework is generic in nature and is not designed for a specific class of applications. Any mobile context aware application can leverage on the framework and utilize the provided functionalities to manage application disruptions. Also, the decoupling of mobile application layer and the underlying context data management layer renders context data management layer transparent to the application design...|$|R
