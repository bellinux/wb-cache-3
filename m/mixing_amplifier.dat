40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a wide-bandwidth, high dynamic range, low-noise cryogenic amplifier {{based on}} a superconducting kinetic inductance traveling-wave device. The device was made from NbTiN and consisted of a long, coplanar waveguide on a silicon chip. By adding a DC current and an RF pump tone {{we are able to}} generate parametric amplification using three-wave mixing. The devices exhibit gain of more than 15 dB across an instantaneous bandwidth from 4 to 8 GHz. The total usable gain bandwidth, including both sides of the signal-idler gain region, is more than 6 GHz. The noise referred to the input of the devices approaches the quantum limit, with less than 1 photon excess noise. Compared to similarly constructed four-wave <b>mixing</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> these devices operate with the RF pump at ∼ 20 dB lower power and at frequencies far from the signal. This will permit easier integration into large scale qubit and detector applications...|$|R

The photon pairs are generated in the 1550 -nm fiber-optic communication band and detected with InGaAs–InP avalanche photodiodes operating in a gated Geiger mode. A generation rate 10 3 pairs/s is observed, which {{is limited by the}} detection electronics at present. We also demonstrate the nonclassical nature of the photon correlations in the pairs.

40|$|A highly efficient, {{practical}} {{approach to}} high-energy terahertz (THz) generation based on spectrally cascaded optical parametric amplification (THz-COPA) is introduced. The THz wave initially generated by difference frequency generation between a strong narrowband optical pump and optical seed (0. 1 - 10 % of pump energy) kick-starts a repeated or cascaded energy down-conversion of pump photons. This helps to greatly surpass the quantum-defect efficiency {{and results in}} exponential growth of THz energy over crystal length. In cryogenically cooled periodically poled lithium niobate, energy conversion efficiencies > 8 % for 100 ps pulses are predicted. The calculations account for cascading effects, absorption, dispersion and laser-induced damage. Due to the coupled nonlinear interaction of multiple triplets of waves, THz-COPA exhibits physics distinct from conventional three-wave <b>mixing</b> parametric <b>amplifiers.</b> This in turn governs optimal phase-matching conditions, evolution of optical spectra as well as limitations of the nonlinear process.

40|$|A highly efficient, {{practical}} {{approach to}} high-energy multi-cycle terahertz (THz) generation based on spectrally cascaded optical parametric amplification (THz-COPA) is introduced. Feasible designs are presented that enable the THz wave, initially generated by difference frequency generation between a narrowband optical pump and optical seed (0. 1 – 10 % of pump energy), to self-start a cascaded (or repeated) energy downconversion of pump photons {{in a single}} pass through a single crystal. In cryogenically cooled, periodically poled lithium niobate, unprecedented energy conversion efficiencies > 8 % achievable with existing pump laser technology are predicted using realistic simulations. The calculations account for cascading effects, absorption, dispersion, and laser-induced damage. Due to the simultaneous, coupled nonlinear evolution of multiple phase-matched three-wave mixing processes, THz-COPA exhibits physics distinctly different from conventional three-wave <b>mixing</b> parametric <b>amplifiers.</b> This, in turn, governs optimal phase-matching conditions, evolution of optical spectra, and limitations of the nonlinear process. Circumventing these limitations is shown to yield conversion efficiencies ≫ 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of nondegenerate ultrabroadband chirped pulse optical parametric amplification {{have been carried}} out. The general mathematical expressions for evaluating parametric bandwidth, gain and gain bandwidth for arbitrary three-wave <b>mixing</b> parametric <b>amplifiers</b> are presented. In our experiments, a type-I noncollinear phase-matched optical parametric amplifier based on lithium triborate, which was pumped by a 5 -ns second harmonic pulses from a Q-switched Nd:YAG operating at 10 Hz, seeded by a 14 -fs Ti:sapphire laser at 800 nm, was presented. The 0. 85 nJ energy of input chirped signal pulse with 57 -FWHM has been amplified to 3. 1 muJ at pump intensity 3 GW/cm(2), the corresponding parametric gain reached 3. 6 x 10 (3), the 53 nm-FWHM gain spectrum bandwidth of output signal has been obtained. The large gain and broad gain bandwidth, which have been confirmed experimentally, provide great potentials to amplify efficiently the broad bandwidth femtosecond light pulses to generate new extremes in power, intensity, and pulse duration using optical parametric chirped pulse amplifiers pumped by powerful nanosecond systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In ultra {{wide band}} (UWB) {{positioning}} systems, the key {{problem is to}} detect the timing of transmitted UWB pulses. Narrow pulses are required for high precision of positioning, thus demanding high sampling rate. To alleviate the difficulty for analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and utilize the feature of time sparsity of UWB pulses, a compressed sensing based scheme is proposed, in which the received signal is <b>mixed</b> using distributed <b>amplifiers,</b> sampled using a bank of low rate ADCs and then reconstructed. To combat the detrimental effect of Gaussian noise, Bayesian compressed sensing is applied, using a structure similar to the iterative decoder for turbo codes to exploit the redundancy in time, history and space. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the Bayesian compressed sensing using redundancy achieves substantial performance gain (UWB pulse recovery rate and positioning precision), compared with traditional compressed sensing approaches.

Therefore, the performance prediction of PA on TX chains is of prime importance. This article describes two different approaches for active antenna appli-cations. The first one concentrates on PA macro-modeling, which takes into account a large output load impedance mismatch with a voltage standing wave ratio up to 4 : 1. A PA behavioral model based on nonlinear scattering functions was developed and extracted from CW measurements. The model validity was checked by comparison with the measured data. The second one describes a novel technique for synthesizing a given radiation pattern, whereas {{taking into account the}} mutual coupling and calculated matching impedances (ZL = 50 V) of each antenna in the array according to frequency and pointing angle...|$|R
