500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an express trust is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot create a trust of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to create a trust, it will be held voidable, and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est factum {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as they no longer have control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their <b>memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E

2500|$|The United States, and a {{few other}} common law countries, split the {{corporate}} constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The <b>memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Association</b> (or articles of incorporation) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. [...] "this company makes automobiles") and specifies the authorised share capital of the company. The articles of association (or by-laws) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In civil law jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the charter.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{payment of}} players {{over and above}} their actual out-of-pocket {{expenses}} was permitted by the Football Association for the first time, in 1885, the Small Heath club turned professional. The players did not receive a salary, but instead shared half the gate money. Three years later, {{at the suggestion of}} Walter Hart, the president of the Birmingham FA who had once been the club's honorary secretary, it became the first football club to structure itself as a limited company with a board of directors, under the name of The Small Heath Football Club Limited. The original company listed its objects as [...] "to acquire a Football Club to play the game of Association Football and the doing all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above", set its nominal capital at £500, to be divided into ten-shilling shares, and its <b>memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> listed seven initial subscribers who between them took up 35 of the 1000 shares. These included Hart, who became the first chairman of its board, Alfred Jones, honorary secretary, and William Starling.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{decision}} has been made about the type of company, formation occurs through a series of procedures with the registrar at Companies House. Before registration, anybody promoting the company to attract investment falls under strict fiduciary duties to disclose all material facts about the venture and its finances. Moreover, anybody purporting to contract in a company's name before its registration will generally be personally liable on those obligations. In the registration process, those who invest money in a company will sign a <b>memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> stating what shares they will initially take, and pledge their compliance with the Companies Act 2006. A standard company constitution, known as the Model Articles, is deemed to apply, or the corporators may register their own individualised articles of association. Directors must be appointed - one in a private company and at least two in a public company - and a public company must have a secretary, but there needs to be no more than a single member. The company will be refused registration if it is set up for an unlawful purpose, and a name must be chosen that is not inappropriate or already in use. This information is filled out in the [...] "IN01" [...] form available on the Companies House website, and a £18 fee is paid for online registration via Business Link in 8 to 10 days, or a £40 [...] fee if using the paper IN01 form (the fee is £100 for same day registration using the paper form). The registrar then issues a certificate of incorporation and a new legal personality enters the stage.|$|E
