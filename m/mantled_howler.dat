25|$|One {{national}} park, the Corcovado National Park, is internationally renowned among ecologists for its biodiversity (including big {{cats and}} tapirs) and is where visitors {{can expect to}} see an abundance of wildlife. Corcovado is the one park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkey species can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the <b>mantled</b> <b>howler,</b> the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey, and the Central American squirrel monkey, found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama, and considered endangered until 2008, when its status was upgraded to vulnerable. Deforestation, illegal pet-trading, and hunting are the main reasons for its threatened status.|$|E

500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey has a restricted distribution in Costa Rica and Panama. It lives only near the Pacific coast. Its range covers Central Pacific Costa Rica {{in the north}} through western Panama. It lives in two of Costa Rica's national parks—Manuel Antonio National Park and Corcovado National Park—where {{it can be seen}} by visitors, but it is not as commonly seen in these parks as the white-headed capuchin or the <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> monkeys. It lives in lowland forests and is restricted to secondary forests and primary forests which have been partially logged. [...] It requires forests with abundant low and mid-level vegetation and has difficulty surviving in tall, mature, undisturbed forests that lack such vegetation.|$|E
5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and Guatemalan black howler.|$|R

Within this framework, we have added insights into the interactions between primate hosts and their parasites from a long-term study in Costa Rica. We collected fecal samples from <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> (Alouatta palliata) over a 9 -year period (19861994 inclusive) and analyzed them for parasite eggs, larvae, cysts, and oocysts. We found many misperceptions inherent in the typical methodology of primate parasite surveys and in the reporting of the findings. Our work in Costa Rica suggests that a snapshot effect occurs with most surveys. A static view does not reflect the dynamic and changing ecological interaction between host and parasite.

There is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous Arsenura armida. As well as insects, the state is known for its many arachnids, and features over 25 species of tarantula (Theraphosidae), of which many are endemic. The state is part of Birdlife International’s Endemic Bird Area(EBA) project due to the number of endemic birds here. Some of these include green-cheeked amazon (Amazona viridigenalis), Tamaulipas crow (Corvus imparatus), Altamira yellowthroat (Geothlypis flavovelata) and crimson-collared grosbeak (Rhodothraupis celaeno). Despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas, it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well. Many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents (Peromyscus ochraventer, Neotoma angustapalata), the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi) and coati (Nasua narica) [...] The endangered Baird's tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state's southern jungle regions, such as Biósfera Los Tuxtlas.

40|$|Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 Abstract Dietary tannins are {{ubiquitous}} in woody plants {{and may have}} serious negative effects on herbivores by inducing a loss of dietary protein and producing toxins if they are hydrolyzed in the gut. Many herbivorous mammals counter {{the negative effects of}} tannins through tannin-binding salivary proteins (TBSPs) that inactivate tannins by forming insoluble complexes and prevent them from interacting with other more valuable proteins. Howlers are the most folivorous New World primates and ingest foods with varying tannin content. We studied the presence of TBSPs in six wild <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> (Alouatta palliata mexicana) immediately after capture and in captivity when fed on two diets composed of natural ingredients: a mixture of fruit and leaves or only leaves.

40|$|In vivo laboratory-based studies {{describing}} jaw-muscle {{activity and}} mandibular bone strain during mastication provide the empirical basis for most evolutionary hypotheses linking primate masticatory apparatus form to diet. However, the laboratory data pose {{a potential problem}} for testing predictions of these hypotheses because estimates of masticatory function and performance recorded in the laboratory may lack the appropriate ecological context for understanding adaptation and evolution. For example, in laboratory studies researchers elicit rhythmic chewing using foods that may differ significantly from the diets of wild primates. Because the textural and mechanical properties of foods influence jaw-muscle activity and the resulting strains, chewing behaviors studied in the laboratory may not adequately reflect chewing behaviors of primates feeding in their natural habitats. To circumvent this limitation of laboratory-based studies of primate mastication, we developed a system for recording jaw-muscle electromyograms (EMGs) from free-ranging primates so that researchers can conduct studies of primate jaw-muscle function in vivo in the field. We used the system to record jaw-muscle EMGs from <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> (Alouatta palliata) at Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica. These are the first EMGs recorded from a noncaptive primate feeding in its natural habitat. Further refinements of the system will allow long-term EMG data collection so that researchers can correlate jaw-muscle function with food mechanical properties and behavioral observations. In addition to furthering understanding of primate feeding biology, our work will foster improved adaptive hypotheses explaining the evolution of primate jaw form. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that all {{male and female}} <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> emigrate from natal groups at Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica. In the years since that report, {{a small number of}} juveniles have stayed in the natal group without experiencing a solitary phase. Here, we present a post hoc analysis on juvenile emigration in six groups of howlers under observation for varying amounts of time between 1972 and 2005. Our records revealed 139 juveniles for whom emigration status was certain, and 125 of these did emigrate. There was a significant association between presence of mother and emigration: juveniles without mothers were more likely to remain in their natal group (chi(1) (2) = 53. 1, P<. 0001). The mean age of emigration for all juveniles (n = 125) was 2. 47 years (SD = 0. 9, range = 1. 5 - 6. 5). There was no difference in age of emigration by adult male composition (one-male, multi-male, both), but juveniles of unknown sex emigrated younger than either known males or females (F(2, 116) = 4. 4, P<. 02). For emigrating juveniles of known sex (n = 99), both males and females without mothers left at a later age than those with mothers (F(1, 95) = 6. 5, P<. 02). Although philopatry or delayed emigration occurs in a few motherless animals, most males and females do emigrate from their natal groups at ages consistent with those reported for other species of howlers...|$|R
5000|$|However, the <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> {{can adapt}} to forest {{fragmentation}} {{better than other}} species due to its low energy lifestyle, small home ranges and ability to exploit widely available food sources.

40|$|Despite early neglect, {{recent studies}} of sexual {{selection}} have shown {{a renewed interest in}} female reproductive strategies. Clearly the traditional portrayal of female animals as passive participants in mating is incorrect, but much is still unknown about female reproductive strategies, including the extent of female mate choice. The primary goal of this dissertation was to explore the role of female mate choice in mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata), a species in which males have previously been assumed to control mating. From March 2006 through February 2007, I used continuous focal-animal sampling to record the behavior of adult female <b>mantled</b> <b>howlers</b> at Hacienda La Pacifica, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The focal animals in the study were nine adult females in a social group that has been regularly monitored since 1984. There were also three capture sessions performed by K. Glander to collect blood samples for genetic paternity analysis. A total of 29 individuals in the study group and eight adult males from surrounding groups were captured. The genetic paternity analyses were largely inconclusive. Of the eight microsatellite markers used previously in this species, only four were polymorphic in this sample. Additionally, nearly half (7 of 16) of the purported mothers were excluded at one locus. Assuming the mother was unknown allowed determination of genetic paternity in only one case. In terms of behavior, females were largely responsible for soliciting copulations, but female mate choice {{did not appear to be}} a major factor. Females almost never rejected copulations (3. 3 % of copulation attempts) and mated with multiple males in 77. 8 % of female cycles. The lack of conclusive genetic paternity data leaves open the possibility of post-copulatory female choice. However, explanations exist for the apparent lack of female mate choice in this species. Because males must attain alpha status to remain in a group, differences in inherent quality may be low among group males. The potential for small differences among males in a social group, combined with the fact that females disperse from their natal group, suggests that female mate choice may occur primarily in choosing a group during dispersal.

5000|$|The conservancy runs a primate field {{school at}} La Suerte which has such courses as [...] "Primate Behavior and Ecology", [...] "Advanced Primate Behavior and Ecology", and [...] "Primate Conservation". The courses {{center on the}} two native primate species of the area: white-faced {{capuchin}} monkeys (Cebus capucinus) and <b>Mantled</b> Black <b>Howler</b> Monkeys (Alouatta palliata). Daily lectures cover a variety of subjects in primatology. Students are divided into small groups to learn skills important to primate field research. Using the tropical rainforest of La Suerte as classrooms, students learn how to map a trail system; how to conduct vegetation sampling and analysis; methods of assessing food availability; and observation techniques to study the social, feeding, and ranging behavior of primates. Independent Research Projects After completing the field methods section of the class, students begin work on their own projects. Faculty members work closely with students as they undertake {{this portion of the}} course. First, each student develops a research proposal detailing the subject to be investigated and the methods to be used. Each student presents his or her proposal to the class. Next, each student must collect data for his or her project; data analysis follows. Finally, students write a final paper on their project and make an oral presentation to the class. http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/idp/idp/entry/494 ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> is {{the most}} folivorous species of Central American monkey. Leaves make up between almost 50% and 75% of the mantled howler's diet. The <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> is {{selective}} about the trees it eats from, and it prefers young leaves to mature leaves. This selectivity is likely to reduce the levels of toxins ingested, since certain leaves of various species contain toxins. Young leaves generally have less toxins {{as well as more}} nutrients than more mature leaves, and are also usually easier to digest. <b>Mantled</b> <b>howler</b> monkeys possess large salivary glands that help break down the leaf tannins by binding the polymers before the food bolus reaches the gut. Although leaves are abundant, they are a low energy food source. The fact that the <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> relies so heavily on a low energy food source drives much of its behaviour - for example, howling to locate other groups and spending {{a large portion of the}} day resting.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Central American monkeys, and males can weigh up to 9.8 kg.

Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods, the <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping. The male <b>mantled</b> <b>howler</b> has an enlarged hyoid bone, a hollow bone near the vocal cords, which amplifies the calls made by the male, and is the reason for the name [...] "howler".
