The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate foliar applications of Macro Sorb (L form amino acids) and KeyPlex (<b>chelated</b> <b>micronutrients</b> and alpha keto amino acids) foliar fertilization materials on Upland cotton. Treatments consisted of various rates and times of application of the foliar materials based upon manufacturer recommendations.

40|$|Shamrock Plant (Oxalis regnellii) is an {{ornamental}} plant grown primarily for St. Patrick's Day. Interveinal chlorosis is a production problem {{and has been}} hypothesized {{to be caused by}} micronutrient deficiencies, either iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn) or virus. Several experiments were conducted testing these hypotheses. A virus screen was conducted and positive identification was found and plants were rouged. Oxalis plants were grown hydroponically on five NO 3 [...] N:NH 4 +-N ratio treatments. Increasing proportions of NO 3 [...] N increased total leaf, root, flower, and bottom shoot biomasses. Other hydroponic studies were conducted removing Fe and Mn from nutrient solutions to characterize the respective deficiencies. Iron deficiency, characteristic interveinal chlorosis on newly developed leaves was observed as early as three weeks after removing Fe. Plants grown without Mn did not exhibit interveinal chlorosis, but were slightly less green than control plants grown in complete nutrient solutions. Iron deficiency was also induced in a greenhouse media, using dolomitic lime. Again, typical interveinal chlorosis and reduced plant growth was observed after two weeks. Tissue analysis confirmed the chlorosis was due to reduced Fe as opposed to limited N or Mn concentrations. Our data suggest Fe influences interveinal chlorosis more than Mn. <b>Micronutrient</b> <b>chelate</b> foliar and media applications were assessed as corrective measures for foliar chlorosis. Media drenches of Fe-EDDHA were effective in regreening Fe deficient oxalis in 5 days. Foliar chelate applications were less effective. Organic acids, such as oxalic acid often assist plants in nutrient acquisition through root exudation. Oxalic acid levels of recently matured leaves increase in Fe deficient O. regnellii plants. Cultural practices such as temperature, irrigation, and fertilizer selection also influence plant growth and incidence of leaf chlorosis. Our research found that cooler temperatures (13 ˚ C) did not increase chlorosis and temperatures of at least 21 ˚ C produced more aesthetically pleasing and floriferous plants. Overhead irrigation, compared with subirrigation produced higher quality and larger O. regnellii. Plant growth and development is best when fertilized with N rates between 100 mg N[MIDDLE DOT] L- 1 and 350 mg N[MIDDLE DOT] L- 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} and compared the fixation and fixation kinetics of copper (Cu) in chelated (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA) and non-chelated mixed systems of micronutrients in the semiarid soils of the Southern High Plains, USA, using findings from Cu extraction studies and kinetic models. Approximately, 22  % more Cu was fixed in the non-chelated system {{compared to the}} chelated within the first 14  days with only 7  % {{difference between the two}} systems by day  90. Findings suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of <b>chelated</b> <b>micronutrients</b> over time, highlighting the significance of timing even when <b>chelated</b> <b>micronutrients</b> are used. The strengths of the relationship of change in available Cu with respect to other micronutrients (iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn)) were higher in the non-chelated system (R 2 : 0. 68 – 0. 94), compared to the chelated (R 2 : 0. 42 – 0. 81), with slopes of 0. 40 (Cu–Fe), 0. 31 (Cu–Mn), and 1. 04 (Cu–Zn) in the non-chelated system and 0. 26 (Cu–Fe), 0. 22 (Cu–Mn), and 0. 90 (Cu–Zn) in the chelated system. Reduction in the amount of available Cu was best described by the power function model (R 2 [*]=[*]  0. 91, SE [*]=[*]  0. 081) in the non-chelated system and second-order model (R 2 [*]=[*]  0. 95, SE [*]=[*]  0. 010) in the chelated system. The applications generated from this study could be used as tools for improved micronutrient management and also provide baseline data for future work in other semiarid/arid alkaline soils of the world. Findings are also more applicable to field settings, an improvement over related previous studies...|$|R
30|$|As the metals {{combined}} with organic compound, the organic complex was formed (chelates) that tightly trapped the metallic elements, preventing their release to the soil. Trapped metals in chelates lost their cationic characteristics, making them {{less prone to}} precipitation that is useful in agriculture. When natural products decomposes, they can generate naturally chelating agents such as organic acids, amino acids, lignin-sulfonates, lignin poly carboxylates, sugar acids and derivatives, phenols, poly flavonoids, siderophores, and phytosiderophores. Other chelating agents could be developed synthetically, both types of chelating/complexion causing increment of micronutrient solubility. One {{of the most important}} characteristics of chelating agents used is the relative stability of various metal chelates, especially if one is considering synthetically developed chelates. In other words, it is the degree of affinity of a given agent for a metal. From the stability constant data, the ability of one metal to compete with another can be estimated. Stability of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>chelate</b> bonded generally determines “plant availability” of the applied <b>micronutrient.</b> An effective <b>chelate</b> relationship is one in which the rate of substitution of the <b>chelated</b> <b>micronutrients</b> for cations already in the soil is low, thus maintaining the applied <b>micronutrient</b> in the <b>chelated</b> form for length of time sufficient to be absorbed by the plant roots. The <b>chelated</b> forms of <b>micronutrients</b> have advantages over traditional forms of inorganic fertilizers such as smaller quantities required, are much more easily absorbed, more easily translocate within the plant, easily assimilated within the plant system, chances of “scorching” of crops, while using chelates is less because they are organic substances, compatible {{with a wide variety of}} pesticides and liquid fertilizers, and are not readily leached from the soil as they adsorb on to the surface of soil particles. It has been found that in the alkaline soils, where Fe solubility and availability to plants are extremely low, adding soluble Fe salts is not very effective, unless the soluble Fe is in a form that does not react with the soil system and yet can be readily assimilated by plants. There are two alternatives available to deal with iron deficiency. These are soil application of iron chelates and foliar sprays containing chelated iron. If the soil pH is alkaline, chelates must be preferred to inorganic salts. In citrus cultivation, application of about 10 – 20 [*]g Fe/tree in chelate form has proved satisfactory. The application of Fe-EDDHA and Fe-sugar acid chelates at 7 [*]mg Fe/l resulted in re-greening of leaves in iron-deficient plants. Chelating agents, from which iron has been released and under conditions favorable to chelation of Mn, compete with plant roots for Mn. Chelating agents have the ability to keep iron sufficiently in solution to provide enough iron at the root surface to effect competition with manganese. Organic zinc fertilizer sources are the che 1 ates of EDTA, NTA, HEDTA, and iron citrate. Other organic sources include Zn-lignin sulfonate, Zn-poly flavonoid, and by-products of the wood pulp industry. Mn is mainly transported as Mn and not as an organic complex. Thus, Mn chelates are effective only when used as liquid fertilizer formulation and hydroponics. Application of Cu chelates with different amino acids increased chlorophyll content, grain yield, amino acid content, and the uptake. True amino acid chelates are emerging as state-of-the-art technology for delivering selected micronutrients with maximum bioavailability, tolerability, and safety. In this study, urea is considered as the main source of nitrogen and a carrier for the obtained nanoparticles, while citric acid is the main chelating agent for potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, manganese, calcium, and amino acids. This is explained as citric acid is one of the most important organic acids in the respiratory pathways into plant cell. Also, it is essential for different biochemical and physiological processes. Potassium citrate increases leaf area, improves leaf mineral content, enhances yield, and improves fruit quality (Ibrahim et al. 2015). Calcium with urea may improve crop production and increases ammonium, potassium, and phosphorus absorption. It also stimulates photosynthesis and increases the size of sellable plant parts (Feagley and Fenn 1998). It is reported that the most optimum form for increasing iron content in plant system is the citrate form which is a significant nutrition for plants and iron deficiency causes severe problem for the soil (Mordoğan et al. 2013). Taha et al. (2014) also concluded the application of banana peel extract as a potential natural source of antioxidant and antimicrobial sources. To determine the effects of foliar application of amino acid and calcium chelate on Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apple trees, a randomized complete block design with four repetitions was conducted. The combination of amino acid and calcium chelate increased weight of both cultivars (Aboul-Enein et al. 2016). Amino acid chelate fertilizers were conducted to test its effect on the growing of Pennisetum American and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) forage crops as well as their effects on some soil properties. The results indicated that organic matter and CEC of soil tended to increase slightly with the use of synthesized fertilizers as compared with unfertilized check; also, they improved the soil content of macro- and microelements. The efficiency of organic synthesized fertilizers was improved when they are applied in combination with 1 / 2 unit or one unit of NPK recommended rates (Arabloo et al. 2017). The effect of both diphenylamin and tryptophan significantly increased plant growth (in terms of plant height, number of leaves/plant, stem diameter, root length, and leaf area, as well as fresh and dry weights of the different plant parts) and the contents of carotenoids, total soluble sugars, and total free amino acids in the leaves as reported (Mostafa et al. 2014). Short-time application of protein hydrolysates increased the root dry weight of maize plants compared to the untreated plants (Abou Dahab and Abd El-Aziz 2006, Nardi et al. 2016). Based on the abovementioned discussion, potassium hydroxide was used for dissolving the cellulosic material, leading to liberation of the fertilizing agent to the solution; then, carrier and chelating agent were added to convert these agents to the nanochelating biostimulant fertilizers. Due to the presence of minerals (K+, Mg++, Fe++, Mn++, Na+, Zn++, and Cu++), tryptophan, amino acids, and protein, a complicated structure with high fertilizing value from the banana peels was obtained.|$|R

40|$|Chelated-buffered {{nutrient}} {{solutions are}} used for studies on micronutrient metals but so far no equivalent system exists for boron nutrition studies: the present investigation was initiated with that intention. From a literature review, {{it was noted that}} a range of substances form chelates with boron including polyhydric alcohols, sugars and phenolic compounds. However, none apart from hydrofluoric acid formed chelates with formation constants comparable to those of <b>micronutrient</b> metal <b>chelates</b> like diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Moreover, most chelating substances had deleterious side effects which reduced their possible use in water culture: many of the compounds are substrates for bacterial growth, some are harmful to handle, and others are toxic to plants or humans. Borosilicate glass; was tested in a laboratory experiment but found to release boron too slowly into solution to maintain constant boron concentration in solution even when very finely ground. Current investigations centre around the use of a boron-specific resin, which strongly complexes H 3 BO 3 on its N-methyl glucamine functional groups. The boron sorption capacity of the resin varied from 2. 2 to 5. 0 mg B g- 1 resin. Boron saturated resin maintained an equilibrium solution boron concentration of 46 ut M when added at the rate of 2 g of resin to 1 L of boron free triple deionised water. Plants grown in complete nutrient solution with boron saturated resin added at 1 g per litre of nutrient solution grew as well as plants grown in conventional nutrient solution containing 9. 2 ut M boron and their shoots contained adequate boron concentrations for growth. There was no evidence that the resin had effects on plant growth other than in releasing and equilibrating boron concentration in the nutrient solution...|$|R
40|$|Restoration of {{degraded}} Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) with long, hot and dry summers is challenging. To develop management guidelines, {{we evaluated}} techniques that could improve seedling establishment in two degraded Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC (tuart) woodlands, given weed and herbivore control. These techniques aimed to mimic favourable conditions for species that primarily recruit following disturbance events (e. g. fire). Trial 1 investigated {{the response of}} 5 -month-old seedlings and broadcast seed in plots that contained a created ashbed, were ripped, or were ripped and contained an ashbed. Trial 2 examined the response of 5 -month-old seedlings to treatments providing a nutrient or moisture source (slow-release <b>fertiliser</b> tablet, <b>chelating</b> agent, slow-release <b>fertiliser</b> tablet plus <b>chelating</b> agent, zeolite, hydrated hydrophilic co-polymers and dry hydrophilic co-polymers). Results indicated that created ashbeds enhance establishment {{for a range of}} species and reduce weed cover, with or without ripping. Broadcast seeding was not successful in returning species to site. Higher growth rates were recorded in seedlings treated with a nutrient source. The present study has shown {{that it is possible to}} re-establish local plant species in degraded woodlands through several techniques that mimic disturbance (e. g. fire). Strong early growth may be the vital start seedlings need in MTEs in the face of reinvading weed species, herbivory and a drying climate...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted from 1992 to 1994 {{to study the}} effect of supplying micronutrients to wheat (Triticum aestivum L. CV. Yecora rojo) grown on calcareous soil. Chelated and/or non chelated forms of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu were administrated through {{a wide range of}} foliar applications; whereas they were sprayed either individually or in combination. All the <b>chelated</b> <b>micronutrients</b> were applied in the form of EDTA with the exception of Fe (EDDHA). However, all the non chelated elements were in the form of sulphate. The grain yield significantly increased in response to the application of individual micronutrients either in the form of sulphate or chelate. But, a much higher amounts of sulphates will be required. Application of micronutrient combinations either in chelated or non chelated forms gave greater biological and grain yields than individual applications of the micronutrient. Wheat response to micronutrient applications followed the order: combined elements * Fe* Cu = Zn *Mn. Application of the micronutrients in sulphate form generally gave higher concentrations of these elements in grain than the chelated forms. Foliar application of the micronutrients in the form of sulphates, at higher application rates, might be more effective than the chelates due to lower cost despite the higher application rate...|$|R
40|$|Phytic acid {{is a major}} storage form of {{phosphorous}} in cereals {{that acts}} as food inhibitor by <b>chelating</b> <b>micronutrients</b> and prevents it to be bioavailabe for monogastric animals, including humans. Ninety three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasms, including cultivars from India, were characterized for phytic acid and Fe contents. Phytic acid contents ranged from 0. 59 (IITR 92) to 2. 08 % (IITR 25). The Fe contents of all wheat germplasms ranged from 9. 97 (IITR 25) to 45. 77 mg kg− 1 (IBW 1133) while historical cultivars from India contain an average of 21. 7 mg kg− 1 Fe. This initial screening facilitated the identification of diversity in germplasms for this trait that can be exploited for genetic improvement in wheat. Forty eight F 2 wheat lines from (WL 711 ×IITR 19) were also evaluated, which demonstrated considerable variation in phytic acid content. Phytic acid contents ranged from 0. 58 to 2. 01 % in F 2 lines {{with an average of}} 1. 52 %. The genotypes showed significant differences in phytic acid and Fe contents. F 2 lines of WL 711 ×IITR 19 also illustrated variation in phytic acid content that were significant. The progenies having lower phytic acid content compared to parents are useful for further crop improvement. A relatively high broad sense heritability (93. 4 %) and genetic advance (32. 3 %) of phytic acid showed that progenies of this cross would be useful for reducing phytic acid...|$|R
40|$|Background: About {{one half}} of school-age {{children}} in developing countries {{are estimated to be}} affected by iron deficiency. Failure to treat micronutrient deficiencies can negatively affect health and economic development. Objective: To determine the effect of multiple micronutrient maize-based liquid meal supplement on the iron status and the nutritional status of primary school children. Design: A randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted. Setting and subjects: The study took place at Sunnyside Primary School in Sunnyside, Pretoria, in the urban area of Tshwane (Gauteng Province, South Africa). Grades 3 and 4 male and female learners aged 8 - 12 years, enrolled in the 2010 academic year were recruited for the study. Methods: Participants were dewormed, to eliminate parasitic infestaion {{at the beginning of the}} study. The experimental product was a maize-based liquid meal supplement enriched with macronutrients and <b>micronutrients</b> including <b>chelated</b> ferrous bisglycinate, while the control had the same macronutrient profile but no added micronutrients. The learners took the meal supplement every morning on school days for 14 weeks. Iron status was measured by Haemoglobin (Hb) levels and the nutritional status was measured by anthropometric measures at baseline and end. Groups were compared with respect to change in Hb and change in anthropometry using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline Hb values as covariate. Testing was done at the 0. 05 level of significance. Results: There was no significant difference in the Hb levels at baseline (12. 6 ± 1. 1 g/dL and 12. 8 ± 1. 1 g/dL) (P = 0. 250) between the experimental and control groups respectively. The prevalence of mild anemia (Hb< 11 g/dL) was low in both the experimental and control groups. Over the 14 weeks study period, consumption of experimental products was similar and there was no significant effect on Hb levels of the participants observed (P = 0. 806) in the experimental and control groups. There was also no significant change observed in the anthropometry of the participants. Conclusion: The maize-based liquid meal supplement enriched with multiple micronutrients did not have a significant effect on the iron status of the participants in this study, possibly owing to low prevalence of anemia, a low rate of consumption and therefore iron absorption.
