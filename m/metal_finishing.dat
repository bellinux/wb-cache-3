25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon in the <b>metal</b> <b>finishing</b> field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from {{bright nickel plating}} solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E

Astronautics Corporation of America and Brady Corporation, {{both of which}} have headquarters in Milwaukee, and Wisconsin Plating Works Inc., Racine, each received special awards. Privately held Astronautics, a major supplier of government and commercial avionics, was honored for its high-technology research and development program. Brady, a publicly owned manufacturer of signs, labels and other identification and security products, received an award for corporate excellence. Privately owned Wisconsin Plating Works, which provides <b>metal</b> <b>finishing</b> services, received an award for employee and environmental stewardship. Nominated {{companies were}} evaluated in areas such as financial growth or consistency, technological advances, product development, environmental solutions, operational excellence/continuous improvement, commitment to employees, and effective research and development.|$|E

500|$|Two {{initiatives}} {{begun by}} the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure {{were part of}} its [...] "reinventing government" [...] program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts {{as a way of}} expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation. Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities, while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis. [...] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned. [...] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and <b>metal</b> <b>finishing</b> and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|In 1829 Antoine-CÃ©sar Becquerel {{developed}} the [...] "constant current" [...] cell, forerunner of the well-known Daniell cell. When this acid-alkali cell was monitored by a galvanometer, current {{was found to}} be constant for an hour, the first instance of [...] "constant current". He applied the results of his study of thermoelectricity to the construction of an electric thermometer, and measured the temperatures of the interior of animals, of the soil at different depths, and of the atmosphere at different heights. He helped validate Faraday's laws and conducted extensive investigations on the electroplating of metals with applications for <b>metal</b> <b>finishing</b> and metallurgy. Solar cell technology dates to 1839 when Becquerel observed that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current.|$|E
