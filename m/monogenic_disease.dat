Unlike many preventive interventions that are directed at groups (e.g., immunization programs), predictive medicine is conducted on an individualized basis. For example, glaucoma is a <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease</b> whose early detection can allow to prevent permanent loss of vision. Predictive medicine is expected to be most effective when applied to polygenic multifactorial disease that are prevalent in industrialized countries, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. With careful usage, predictive medicine methods such as genetic screens can help diagnose inherited genetic disease caused by problems with a single gene (such as cystic fibrosis) and help early treatment. Some forms of cancer and heart disease are inherited as single-gene diseases and some people in these high-risk families may also benefit from access to genetic tests. As more and more genes associated with increased susceptibility to certain diseases are reported, predictive medicine becomes more useful.|$|E

SVD is thought to result in reduced cerebral blood flow, impaired cerebral autoregulation and increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying SVD are incompletely understood. Recent studies in monogenic forms of SVD, such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and ‘sporadic’ SVD have shed light on possible disease mechanisms in SVD. Proteomic and biochemical studies in post-mortem monogenic SVD patients, {{as well as in}} animal models of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease</b> have suggested that disease pathways are shared between different types of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease,</b> often involving the impairment of extracellular matrix (ECM) function. In addition, genetic studies in ‘sporadic’ SVD have also shown that the disease is highly heritable, particularly among young-onset stroke patients, and that common variants in <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease</b> genes may contribute to disease processes in some SVD subtypes. Genetic studies in sporadic lacunar stroke patients have also suggested distinct genetic mechanisms between subtypes of SVD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also shed light on other potential disease mechanisms that may be shared with other diseases involving the white matter, or with pathways implicated in <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease.</b> This review brings together recent data from studies in monogenic SVD and genetic studies in ‘sporadic’ SVD.

40|$|SummaryWhile the {{prevalence}} of most diseases caused by single-gene mutations is low and defines them as rare conditions, all together, <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> account for approximately 10 in every 1000 births according to the World Health Organisation. Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) could offer a therapeutic option in <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> in two ways: by substituting for an injured liver or by supplying a tissue that can replace a mutant protein. In this respect, LT may {{be regarded as the}} correction of a disease {{at the level of the}} dysfunctional protein. <b>Monogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> that involve the liver represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. In conditions associated with predominant liver parenchymal damage (i. e., genetic cholestatic disorders, Wilson’s disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, tyrosinemia, α 1 antitrypsin deficiency), hepatic complications are the major source of morbidity and LT not only replaces a dysfunctional liver but also corrects the genetic defect and effectively cures the disease. A second group includes liver-based genetic disorders characterised by an architecturally near-normal liver (urea cycle disorders, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, primary hyperoxaluria type 1, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome- 1). In these defects, extrahepatic complications are the main source of morbidity and mortality while liver function is relatively preserved. Combined transplantation of other organs may be required, and other surgical techniques, such as domino and auxiliary liver transplantation, have been attempted. In a third group of <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases,</b> the underlying genetic defect is expressed at a systemic level and liver involvement is just one of the clinical manifestations. In these conditions, LT might only be partially curative since the abnormal phenotype is maintained by extrahepatic synthesis of the toxic metabolites (i. e., methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia). This review focuses on principles of diagnosis, management and LT results in both paediatric and adult populations of selected liver-based <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases,</b> which represent examples of different transplantation strategies, driven by the understanding of the expression of the underlying genetic defect...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} issues arising from two uses of genomics: 1) the development of gene therapy; 2) and use of pharmacogenetics to identify a patient's genotype before treatment to exclude those who will not benefit or who may be harmed. We conclude that private-sector investment aimed at developing gene therapy for <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is likely to be}} socially suboptimal. Short-term administration regimens yielding long-term therapeutic benefits are likely to meet payer resistance to large “one-off” costs because of budget constraints or, in competitive systems, concerns that the savings would accrue to future insurers or would attract high-cost patients. For some <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases,</b> patient numbers may be too small to support commercial development without changes to orphan drug legislation or payer willingness to accept higher cost-effectiveness thresholds. In the case of pharmacogenetics, we conclude that it can often be socially optimal to test before treatment, particularly if the proportion of nonresponders is high, if there is a potential for serious adverse reactions, or if the test is inexpensive. Genetic testing that fragments the patient population could reduce incentives for R&D unless prices are adjusted to reflect the higher expected benefits of targeted treatment per patient. Even in situations where prices are adjusted, patient populations may be too small to make commercial development viable. This problem with small numbers is analogous to that associated with gene therapy for <b>monogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> and may require similar remedies if society values developing treatments for these diseases...|$|R

Material and methods. Seventy-eight patients were randomized into main (n= 26) and placebo groups (n= 52). Primary combined end-point included the following: genetic analysis of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease,</b> chromosome aberrations, genotypes and allele patterns for main polymorphic candidate genes participating in arterial hypertension (AH) and atherosclerosis pathogenesis; pharmacogenetic features of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive pharmaceutical therapy effectiveness; incorporated gamma-nuclide activity in critical organs. Results. Combined therapy with statins (target levels achieved in 92 % of the patients), fibrates (91 %), and angiotensin II antagonists (95 %) was highly effective and safe in RVH / ischemic nephropathy treatment. Genetic analysis demonstrated <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease,</b> adverse polymorphic gene genotypes, and chromosome aberrations linked to AH, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (MS), in more than 30 % of the participants. Stem sell transplantation (SCT) resulted in a 7, 1 -fold increase in concentration of mononuclear cells with high telomerase activity and long telomeres. Higher prevalence of adverse genome characteristics in Ural population (by 2, 7 times, comparing to Dutch population) could be partially explained by adverse radio-ecology in the former region: caesium, iodine, cobalt, manganese, and chrome concentrations were 12, 6 times higher than their upper safety limits. SC could act as radionuclide discorporants, reducing radionuclide concentration by 1, 4 - 2, 3 times. Pharmacogenetic analysis demonstrated minimal gene polymorphism sensitivity and maximal effectiveness for the combination of fluvastatin forte and fenofibrate M (36 %), as well as valsartan (44 %).

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disease</b> is a single base DNA variant {{resulting}} in an amino acid substitution.

A support vector machine (SVM) was trained on a set of mutations causative of disease, and a control set of non-disease causing mutations. In jack-knifed testing, the method identifies 74 % of disease mutations, with a false positive rate of 15 %. Evaluation of a set of in vitro mutagenesis data with the SVM established that the majority of disease mutations affect protein stability by 1 to 3 kcal/mol.

Fifty-seven molecularly unsolved BPES patients underwent high-resolution copy number screening and targeted sequencing of CNCs.
