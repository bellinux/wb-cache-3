2500|$|As {{explained}} above, a set {{of three}} orthonormal polarizations (...) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction [...] in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation {{it is possible to}} create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. piezoelectric transducers with the needed oscillation mode). Thus it is possible to measure the sound velocity of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the test specimen a coupling medium is needed to transmit the acoustic energy from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal sound velocity this is sufficient, however fluids do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the test specimen the incident longitudinal wave must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through <b>mode</b> <b>conversion.</b> Such shear waves are then converted back to longitudinal waves at the solid/fluid surface propagating back through the fluid to the recording transducer enabling the measurement of shear wave velocities as well through a coupling medium.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of correlation between scatterers on coherent waves propagation is {{studied in the}} case of a viscoelastic medium hosting a random configuration of either spherical or cylindrical scatterers. A distinction is made between the hole correction and the additional disturbances to the pair correlation function beyond the excluded volume via a radial and concentration dependent Ursell function. The effect of the Ursell function on the effective wavenumber is shown to be of order 3 in concentration and order 2 in scattering, and the corresponding formulas generalize those of Caleap et al. (2012) for an ideal fluid host medium. The whole order 3 in concentration is calculated; its other part is of order 3 in scattering. Both parts of the order 3 in concentration are the sum of two terms, one related to <b>mode</b> <b>conversions,</b> the other not. The numerical study is performed mostly for aluminum spheres in epoxy, which is a rather illustrative situation of the different phenomena that participate to the coherent propagation. The Ursell function effect is enhanced at low frequency, while counteracted partly at higher frequency, by the other term of order 3 in concentration. The most visible effects of both terms are on the attenuation. The Ursell term related to <b>mode</b> <b>conversions</b> is larger than the one with no <b>mode</b> <b>conversions</b> included in the low frequency regime...|$|R

40|$|Summary The deep {{offshore}} of the Gulf of Guinea {{is a challenge}} to seismic processing and imaging techniques, due to the complexity of the salt body structures and the omnipresence of <b>mode</b> <b>conversions</b> that mask the primary signal. Even though true (Kirchhoff) prestack time migration can recover the top of salt and wide, sedimentary basins (not salt covered), it fails elsewhere. We show that wave equation 3 D PreSDM is necessary to properly image target sedimentary reflectors in between and below salt domes, compared to Kirchhoff 3 D PreSDM. However, this is true only for synthetic data using an exact model; in practice, the difficulty of deriving a proper model of sediment velocities drastically reduces {{the difference between the two}} algorithms. We show further that one of the difficulties of building this model, i. e. masking of sediment pinchouts against salt flanks by strong <b>mode</b> <b>conversions,</b> can be overcome using appropriate filtering techniques...|$|R

50|$|As {{transverse}} waves, S-waves exhibit properties, such as polarization and birefringence, {{much like}} other transverse waves.

Similarly, if an SV-wave strikes an interface, the same four modes occur in different proportions.

In order to get more meaningful information of a surface discontinuity, understanding of the waves in the transmitted wave train is important;The characteristics of wedge type Rayleigh wave transducer were studied first.
