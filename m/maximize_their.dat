5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|Rome's revenue equaled {{the amount}} of the {{successful}} bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E

5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built for the Black Sea Fleet. Their design was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two side-by-side forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended to <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in the Black Sea and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
5|$|The Genocide run {{requires}} the player to kill all monsters and <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> LOVE. As Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains {{that they were}} resurrected by the player's LOVE. The player is then asked to join them {{in the destruction of}} the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice. In order to enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their soul to Chara in exchange for restoring the universe. In doing so, the ending of every subsequent Pacifist route is marred by Chara's malevolent presence.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E
5|$|To <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> {{chances of}} success, Square {{searched for a}} Western company to assist with {{releasing}} the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
30|$|For some results, we want {{to allow}} {{individuals}} {{to be nice to}} each other if they choose to be. However, this is not possible in every game. For example, {{in the battle of the}} sexes, an individual cannot be kind to his or her opponent, given that when a person <b>maximizes</b> <b>their</b> opponentâ€™s material payoffs, they are <b>maximizing</b> <b>their</b> own material payoffs as well. We define a game where all individuals can be kind in every possible situation as a kind-game.|$|R

25|$|In microeconomics, {{the utility}} {{maximization}} problem and its dual problem, the expenditure minimization problem, are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, consumers {{are assumed to}} <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> utility, while firms are usually assumed to <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> profit. Also, agents are often modeled as being risk-averse, thereby preferring to avoid risk. Asset prices are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing stochastic processes rather than on static optimization. International trade theory also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of portfolios {{is an example of}} multi-objective optimization in economics.|$|E
