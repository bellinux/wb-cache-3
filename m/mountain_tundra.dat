40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relations between}} vegetation spectra measured in the field along the nutrient and elevation gradient in the most valuable parts of The Krkonoše <b>Mountains</b> <b>tundra</b> and selected parameters describing vegetation state and condition (fAPAR, plant cover and average vegetation height). The main goal was to find relations and indices based on spectral measurements {{that could be used}} for vegetation evaluation and classification in practice and management. The vegetation parameters and spectral properties were also compared for two datasets – one acquired in July and second in August 2015. The best correlations were obtained for plant cover (R 2 above 0. 8 for July dataset and above 0. 7 for August dataset) and two types of indices – using the wavelengths of red edge, e. g. OSAVI or mND 705, and indices for vegetation water content estimates using the wavelengths in shortwave infrared region of the spectra in combination with wavelengths above 800 nm, e. g. NDII. The worst results were found for fAPAR with maximal values of R 2 just above 0. 4 with the indices using the wavelengths around 700 nm. For vegetation height the results differ between July and August data – R 2 around 0. 62 in July and only 0. 47 in August for vegetation indices using the wavelengths of visible and red edge regions...|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{location}} {{on the cusp of}} the Euro-Siberian and Central Asian-Mongolian terrains, the flora and fauna exhibit a high biodiversity for mid latitudes. Animal species that inhabitant both <b>mountains</b> and <b>tundra</b> such as the irbis (snow leopard), Siberian roe deer, and Altai snowcock flourish here, as well as taiga-dwellers such as the maral, Eurasian lynx and wolverine. Steppe-dwellers include the Mongolian lark, demoiselle crane and long-tailed ground squirrel. Desert inhabitants include the bustard and midday jird. There are 359 bird species alone. Since the Hollow is a protected area, many species extirpated elsewhere are found here.|$|R
