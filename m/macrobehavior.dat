Over time, individuals participating in these complex systems make choices that influence the behavior of other individuals. These types of interactions are present in both human and computational systems. For example, complex interactive behaviors are demonstrated as audience members enter a talk (Schelling 1978) and software agents negotiate over shared resources (Klein, Metzler, & Bar-Yam 2005). <b>Macrobehaviors</b> arise when groups or aggregations of individuals develop grouplevel structure through interactions of individual characteristics and actions.

40|$|An {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} the diffusion of a practice in a population {{is the emergence of}} a de facto classificatory schema, distinguishing between actors that adopt a practice and those that do not. To investigate diffusion as classification, I develop a simulation model that highlights the conditions under which limited diffusion of practices leads to the emergence and entrenchment of classificatory schemas. The model depicts classification as a systemic phenomenon resulting from the interplay of actor-level micromotives and field-level <b>macrobehaviors</b> that jointly drive diffusion. Whereas extant theory on the origin of classificatory schemas emphasizes the role of agency, results from the model suggest that classificatory schemas can emerge somewhat unintentionally as practices diffuse. Moreover, by conceptualizing diffusion as classification, I suggest a means for disentangling the closely related and often conflated concepts of diffusion and institutionalization...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor {{and actor}} networks (WSANs), nodes collaborate to accomplish distributed sensing and computation. One {{of the most}} attractive features is that global <b>macrobehaviors</b> in the network emerge from local micro-actions in and interactions between nodes. In this paper, we review a recently proposed approach, which bases on a chemical metaphor and its related theory, to design, analyze, and implement systems with such an emerging property. As an example of distributed, emerging computation in WSNs, we extend an existing gossiplike chemistry-inspired protocol (the “Disperser”) and propose a new chemically driven solution to consensus problems that is applicable in WSNs. We analyze it with a signal processing approach and validate results through simulations. The proposed chemical algorithm {{is not based on}} the iterative packet-exchange but rather on a continuous rate-modulation. The algorithm is thought to lie at the physical layer and to directly control the basic transmission hardware of the nodes in a sort of protocol-less operation mode...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{critical}} mass was originally created by game theorist Thomas Schelling and sociologist Mark Granovetter {{to explain the}} actions and behaviors {{of a wide range}} of people and phenomenon.

He did use the term [...] "critical density" [...] with regard to pollution in his [...] "On the Ecology of Micromotives".

40|$|By {{studying}} two {{well known}} hypotheses in economics, this paper illustrates how emergent properties {{can be shown}} in an agent-based artificial stock market. The two hypotheses considered are the efficient market hypothesis and the rational expectations hypothesis. We inquire whether the <b>macrobehavior</b> depicted by these two hypotheses is consistent with {{our understanding of the}} microbehavior. In this agent-based model, genetic programming is applied to evolving a population of traders learning over time. We first apply a series of econometric tests to show that the EMH and the REH can be satisfied with some portions of the artificial time series. Then, by analyzing traders' behavior, we show that these aggregate results cannot be interpreted as a simple scaling-up of individual behavior. A conjecture based on sunspot-like signals is proposed to explain why <b>macrobehavior</b> can be very different from microbehavior. We assert that the huge search space attributable to genetic programming can induce sunspot-like signals, and we use simulated evolved complexity of forecasting rules and Granger causality tests to examine this assertion...|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain an}} {{improved}} and more accurate {{understanding of the}} relationship between the P-wave velocity and the mechanical properties of damaged sandstone, uniaxial compression tests were performed on sandstone subjected to different high-temperature treatments or freeze-thaw (F-T) cycles. After high-temperature treatment, the tests showed a generally positive relationship between the P-wave velocity and mechanical characteristics, although there were many exceptions. The mechanical properties showed significant differences for a given P-wave velocity. Based on the mechanical tests after the F-T cycles, the mechanical properties and P-wave velocities exhibited different trends. The UCS and Young’s modulus values slightly decreased after 30, 40, and 50 cycles, whereas both an increase and a decrease occurred in the P-wave velocity. The UCS, Young’s modulus, and P-wave velocity represent different <b>macrobehaviors</b> of rock properties. A statistical relationship exists between the P-wave velocity and mechanical properties, such as the UCS and Young’s modulus, but no mechanical relationship exists. Further attention should be given to using the P-wave velocity to estimate and predict the mechanical properties of rock...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{documents}} a {{wide range}} of nonreductive scientific treatments of phenomena in the domain of physics. These treatments strongly resist characterization as explanations of <b>macrobehavior</b> exclusively in terms of behavior of microconstituents. For they are treatments in which macroquantities are cast in the role of genuine and irreducible degrees of freedom. ‘‘One is driven into reductionism when one is not cultivated to possess an array of distinctions rich enough to let things be what they are. In contrast, making the decisive distinction has an illuminating and liberating effect because it lets the concrete occurrence stand forth for what it is.

Alongside increasing returns, network externalities, and information cascades, information contagion has been presented in the literature as an explanation for particular patterns of <b>macrobehavior</b> that may seem at odds with the underlying micromotives. But whereas these other explanations have been shown to have a proper microfoundation, information contagion has remained a phenomenon that seemed to occur only when certain ad hoc rules of thumb for individual behavior are assumed. We show how information-contagious behavior can emerge in a coevolutionary process of interacting adaptive agents, how this is related to various Hayekian themes, and how ACE research in general is an application of Hayek’s methodological insights...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{major issue}} in {{building}} acoustics concerns the need to increase or adapt the absorption spectrum of commonly used sound absorbing materials. However, the most advanced models used to characterize and predict sound absorbing material performances are based on macroscopic parameters, which are inter-dependant, and do not take explicitly into account the local geometry description of the porous media, i. e. microstructure. For these reasons, optimizing sound absorbing material performances firstly relies on our ability to predict acoustic properties of porous media from the description of their local geometry, and secondly to propose pertinent physically realistic modifications of the microstructure having predictable impacts on the absorption spectrum. Starting from an open-cell foam sample having poor sound absorption properties, this paper exposes how the link between microstructure and <b>macrobehavior</b> is achieved, and how its sound absorption is increased from the optimization of its microstructure...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{behavior}} analysis {{provides an}} operant understanding of consumption {{as the result}} of the scope of the consumer behavior setting and the pattern of reinforcement that maintains it. The theory of the marketing firm shows how organizations respond to consumer behavior by managing the consumer behavior setting scope and pattern of reinforcement. Environment-impacting consumption and corporate attempts to reverse its impact can therefore be understood in operant terms. The question remains how we can understand the relationship between a complex contextual system like a firm, the behavior of which is predictable and controllable by considering its emergent operant consequences, and the collective behaviors of consumers, each of whom is a contextual system responding uniquely to the peculiar pattern of contingencies that shapes and maintains its behavior.

40|$|Nobel Prize in {{chemistry}} awarded in 1977 to Ilya Prigogine, {{a challenge to}} the geographical modelling community. Schelling is widely cited in geography, and it is his work in game theory which is of most interest to our discussion. At the beginning of the 1970 s, Schelling [SCH 71, SCH 69] attempted to show how cities structured in community blocks, where white and black face each other without integration. The studies which he carried out show however that people {{do not want to be}} a majority in a district, they are not segregationists, but that the wish not to constitute a large minority produces segregation. In other words, there can be segregation without any desire for it. Schelling is thus able to highlight simple and at the same time comprehensible and very profound ideas, as in Micromotives and <b>Macrobehavior</b> [SCH 78]. In this book published in 1978, Schelling puts forward a model to explore the paradox of segregation. He uses a chess board with...|$|E

Any other use requires prior permission of the author and the American Institute of Physics. International audienceIn this article, the issue of reconstructing an idealized periodic unit cell (PUC) to represent a porous medium is examined by means of microcomputed tomography (μCT). Using μCT, three-dimensional images of open-cell foam are collected and used to characterize the representative parameters of its cellular morphology. These parameters are used in order to reconstruct the porous medium {{by means of an}} idealized PUC: a tetrakaidecahedron with ligaments of triangular cross sections, whose characteristic dimensions have been measured on the μCT images. The proposed reconstruction of the idealized PUC is applied to four aluminum foams. The averaged macroscopic properties of the foams (open porosity and thermal characteristic length) are deduced from their respective PUC model and compared to experimental measurements and literature data. Good correlations are obtained. For each of the foams, this provides a parameterized idealized periodic unit cell on which the partial differential equations governing sound dissipation and propagation in foams can be solved with a view to studying the microphysical basis of the acoustical <b>macrobehavior...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{want to focus}} on two {{mechanisms}} that may help to explain levels of drug use in a society: observational learning and self-reinforcing social stigma effects. In short, before deciding whether to experiment with drugs or not potential users learn about the dangers (and attractions) of using drugs by observing what happened to previous users and they consider the amount of stigma associated with taking drugs. The general approach is very much inspired by Schelling’s (1978) book on “Micromotives and <b>Macrobehavior.</b> ” He shows how social science may produce counterintuitive (but true) results by focusing on social interaction. One well known example is how we may end up with completely ethnically segregated neighbourhoods even if everyone wants to live in a mixed neighbourhood with, say, 60 % of their own ethnic group and 40 % of the minority. To me this showed the importance of focusing on social interaction between heterogeneous agents instead of assuming a “representative agent ” as is often done in the economics literature (see Kirman). A second inspiration for the current paper, is theories of bounded rationality and learning in evolutionary game theory (see Conlisk (1996) and Michihiro(1996)). This is partly because...|$|E
40|$|Schelling (in Micromotives and <b>Macrobehavior,</b> Norton, New York, 1978) {{suggested}} a simple binary choice model {{to explain the}} variation of corruption levels across societies. His basic idea was that the expected profitability of engaging in corruption depends on its prevalence. The key result of the so-called Schelling diagram is the existence of multiple equilibria and a tipping point. The present paper puts Schelling’s essentially static approach into an intertemporal setting. We show how {{the existence of an}} unstable interior steady state leads to thresholds such that history alone or history in addition to expectations (or coordination) is necessary to determine the long-run outcome. In contrast to the related literature, which classifies these two cases according to whether the unstable equilibrium is a node or a focus, the actual differentiation is more subtle because even a node can lead to an overlap of solution paths such that the initial conditions alone are insufficient to uniquely determine the competitive equilibrium. Another insight is that a (transiently) cycling competitive equilibrium can dominate the direct and monotonic route to a steady state, even if the direct route is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{two kinds of}} steel powder were (Distaloy HP- 1 & Ultrapac-LA) {{selected}} and subjected to powder metallurgy processing. For Ultrapac-LA, a heterogeneous microstructure consisting of tempered martensite, nickel-rich ferrite, divorced pearlite and nickel-rich regions surrounding pores was observed. For Distaloy HP- 1 in slow cooling rates (0. 4 °C. s- 1), the amounts of martensite and bainite varied between 50 - 60 % and 30 - 40 %. However, for fast cooling rates (1. 2 °C. s- 1), the variation was between 70 - 80 % and 10 - 20 %. The mechanical properties of the prepared samples were studied with controlled production conditions such as cooling rate and heat treatment. The increasing porosity was found {{to play an important}} role in the tensile stress and fatigue strength. The ultimate tensile strength and fatigue strength were more than 1000 MPa and 400 MPa in this research (for Distaloy HP- 1, 7. 2 g. cm- 3, 0. 5 % carbon content and fast cooling rates). Macroscopic examination of the fracture surfaces for all specimens revealed that fatigue crack growth and final fracture regions were brittle and without noticeable permanent deformation.

Part I contains the preliminaries, including {{an introduction to the}} basic phenomena in social networks that call for a logical analysis of information and reasoning, a review of background material from logic and social network theory, plus an outline of the thesis. Part II presents logical models of collective failures, and illuminates how and when sound individual microbehavior can lead to counterproductive collective <b>macrobehavior.</b> Part III abstracts from specific case studies to investigate the general logic of diffusion phenomena in social networks, as well as the interaction of information and diffusion dynamics. Finally, Part IV presents a summary of our findings, and some ongoing work and perspectives for future research. We discuss modal logics and related formalisms for studying network behavior under various graph properties and rules of influence. We also discuss the natural transition from network evolution by fixed rules as studied in this thesis to the study of network games where agents have choices and goals. Overall, this thesis applies tools from current logics of information update and agency to social network analysis and opinion flow over time, offering both tools for detailed modeling of specific scenarios and {{a better understanding of the}} general laws of reasoning that underlie information and diffusion dynamics in social settings...|$|E
40|$|Exciting and {{unexpected}} patterns can emerge when systems are highly connected, {{even when they}} are composed of the simplest objects. In this thesis we investigate how networks of people, oscillators, apps, and nodes can be better understood through the behavior of the communities that emerge from their close interactions. Work in this thesis first examines how recent advances in dynamical systems have shed new light on the <b>macrobehavior</b> of networks of coupled oscillators. The dimensionality of the system is greatly reduced by viewing the system not as one of individual coupled oscillators, but as one of a smaller number of interacting groups. We demonstrate that the corresponding governing equations can be solved exactly. This thesis then investigates the seed set expansion problem, or how to uncover the local community structure hidden around nodes, in social and other real-world networks. We explore how topological properties of communities and seed sets correlate with algorithm performance, and explain these empirical observations with theoretical ones. We then turn our focus back to a theoretical setting and develop a principled framework for evaluating ranking methods by studying seed set expansion applied to the stochastic block model. We derive the optimal gradient for separating the two classes of nodes in a stochastic block model, and find, surprisingly, that it is asymptotically equivalent to personalized PageRank. This connection provides a novel formal motivation for the success of personalized PageRank in seed set expansion and node ranking generally. We then leverage this framework to develop several theoretically motivated heuristics that incorporate higher moments of landing probabilities, and show that these techniques yield much stronger performance on seed set expansion for stochastic block models. Work {{in the second part of}} this thesis discusses two other highly connected networks, the Facebook social network, and the network of communication between researchers in a series of massive collaborations. In the first case we develop a retention model that accurately models users' tendencies to continue using apps, and at the social level we organize apps along two fundamental axes - popularity and sociality - and show how a user's probability of adopting an app depends on properties of both the local network structure and the match between the user's attributes, their friends' attributes, and the dominant attributes within the app user population. We show how our models give rise to compact sets of features with strong performance in predicting app success. In the second case we study a series of massive online collaborations of professional and amateur mathematicians, who collectively attempt to solve open problems in mathematics research. We identify interesting patterns in the linguistic structure and social reactions that distinguish important research contributions from less important ones. We also observe distinct changes in the language behavior, and the structure and timing of interactions between the same group of contributors depending on whether they are working on a research problem, or simply a very difficult but solved problem taken from the International Math Olympiad...|$|E
