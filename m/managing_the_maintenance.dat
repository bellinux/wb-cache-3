40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we study}} the {{maintenance}} of city parking facilities (CPFs), specifically on modeling and support for decision-making related to planning CPF maintenance. <b>Managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of CPFs is complicated {{because it is a}} multi-disciplinary problem involving many participants, huge quantities of information, limited budgets, and conflicts of goals and criteria. These facts indicate that the decision-making processes in <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of CPFs are ill-defined problems. To help maintenance managers cope with this complexity, we propose an approach that combines analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) and PROMETHEE multicriteria methods, and apply this approach to a priority-setting problem. After assessing the conditions of existing CPFs and the planned states of those CPFs, our approach produced a goal tree and criteria, and defined possible actions for the parking facilities. Representatives of stakeholders provided criteria weights by applying the AHP method. Using PROMETHEE II, we ranked the priorities, and the PROMETHEE V method allowed us to define the implementation phases of maintenance, producing the final maintenance plan. We validated our concept in the city of Split...|$|E

The model offers a capability for modelling the bridge asset which overcomes the limitations in the currently used modelling techniques reported in the literature. The bridge model also provides a means of predicting the future asset condition as a result of adopting different maintenance strategies. The solution of the Petri net model is performed using a Monte Carlo simulation routine. The application of the model to a typical metal railway bridge is also presented in the article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Vibration {{monitoring}} {{is becoming}} an established technique for <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of machinery. Machine condition monitoring {{is the process of}} monitoring the condition of a machine with the intent to predict mechanical wear and failure. Vibration, noise, and temperature measurements are often used as key indicators {{of the state of the}} machine. This paper deals with monitoring the vibrations on the machine with the help of ADXL 345 Accelerometer and performing the turning operation on brass and mild steel at various parameters and analyzing the time response and frequency response graph. For processing and analysis of vibration signal, time domain and frequency domain analysis of vibration signal is implemented. Machine condition monitoring is important because it provides information about the health of a machine. We can use this information to detect warning signs early and help your organization stop unscheduled outages, optimize machine performance, and reduce repair time and maintenance costs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{water supply}} block system {{is used for}} {{detecting}} a leakage by grouping the drainpipe network in large, medium and small blocks, and <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of suitable fluid pressure and flow and measuring the flow of each block. As the block system of water supply was introduced, {{an enormous amount of}} flow data stream is created from the block, and the necessity to process this in real time has ensued. To resolve this necessity, this thesis reviews the method for detecting a leakage in the block in real time, using CEP (Complex Event Processing). CEP processes the events arising from multiple sources in real time, and derives a significant event. CEP is used to detect the occurrence of a leakage within the block, while observing the flow data obtained from customers in small blocks as well as the flow data of small block flow meters. Furthermore, this thesis presents the visualization tools for displaying the leakage results detected from CEP on the map...|$|E

This allows the number, timing, and extent of maintenance actions to be predicted over the service life of RC structures. The analysis includes the effect of inspection interval, maintenance technique, repair efficiency, and repair threshold. Results are presented for a typical RC bridge deck subject to a corrosive marine environment. It was found that repair efficiency affecting time to corrosion initiation of repaired concrete is more critical to the performance of the repair than the repair efficiency that affected corrosion rate...|$|E

In doing so, this paper characterizes factors that breed complexity in maintaining today's operations.

Cost effective methods for predictive maintenance are progressively demanded in the automotive industry.

A more autonomous approach must be developed. In this paper we evaluate {{the performance of the}} COSMO approach for automatic detection of air pressure related faults on a fleet of city buses. The method is both generic and robust. Histograms of a single pressure signal are collected and compared across the fleet and deviations are matched against workshop maintenance and repair records.

40|$|M. Ing. Until very {{recently}} reactive maintenance was still {{used in the}} mining industry. Equipment failures occurred without warning and resulted in catastrophic breakdowns and large production losses and maintenance cost. As a result, the mining industry turned to preventative maintenance that focused on changing parts before they fail. Although preventative maintenance was an improvement over reactive maintenance practices, equipment reliability did not necessarily improve. Next came predictive diagnostics, which monitored the health of components within assemblies, and thereby predicting the life expectancy of assemblies through vibration analysis, infrared thermography, lubrication and oil analysis and ultrasonic detection. However, the level of success could not be achieved. Many hours {{and a lot of}} money are spent in developing and implementing a maintenance management system, but without the correct approach, efficient maintenance might not be achieved.

40|$|The {{aging of}} bridges and traffic volume {{increase}} result in deterioration of bridge conditions and consequently increased risks to bridges and users. Highway {{agencies in the}} United States face challenges {{because of lack of}} sufficient resources to maintain bridges in good conditions. Current bridge management practices use cost as the main factor for determining maintenance strategies for bridges. Bridge management methods that identify bridges based on risk considerations and produce cost-effective maintenance strategies are needed to best utilize limited resources for reducing risks associated with bridge conditions. This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a methodology for defining bridge maintenance strategies based on risks associated with conditions of bridge elements and costs needed to improve these conditions. The methodology is a systematic approach for assessing risks to bridge elements based on their failure probabilities and consequences and managing associated risks using cost-effective maintenance strategies. The proposed methodology defines maintenance scenarios, optimal policies that minimize cost of maintenance and risks to elements, and optimal timing for implementing or deferring maintenance policies. The element-level maintenance policies in the proposed methodology are integrated with bridge-level priority ranking to define practical maintenance strategies for an inventory of bridges. The bridges are prioritized for maintenance according to their risk values and risk-reduction effectiveness of their maintenance policies based on benefit-cost analysis. The proposed methodology builds on existing bridge management methods, and allows for the use of risks associated with bridge conditions to assist in making risk-informed decisions for allocating limited resources for cost-effective maintenance strategies of bridges most in need. The study showed that risk is a viable tool for <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of bridges in a cost-effective manner.
