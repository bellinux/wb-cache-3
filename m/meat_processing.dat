5|$|In 1893, Esbjerg {{became a}} {{municipality}} {{in its own}} right (initially known as Esbjerg Ladeplads), receiving the status and privileges of a market town in 1899 and incorporating the parish of Jerne (east of the centre) in 1945. A number of institutions and facilities were soon established, including the courthouse and town hall (1891), the gas and waterworks (1896) and the power plant (1907). From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country's major export centres. Established in 1895 by nine local dairies, the butter-packaging factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employed some 150 workers until 1920, packing and dispatching butter for the London market. It was later extended to include egg marketing under the name Dansk Andels Ægeksport. Ultimately, it handled produce from 140 dairies spread across the whole of Jutland. After the Second World War, the town developed several agricultural industries, especially <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> and packaging with a plant employing over 300. The slaughterhouse and meat packaging facility, Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri, established in 1887, became Denmark's sixth largest by 1962. It later became part of Vestjyske Slagterier in 1986, and in 2001, it was acquired by Danish Crown.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{evaluate}} and access the growth rates and biomass productivity in different concentrations of microalgae Scenedesmus sp. using Industrial <b>Meat</b> Food <b>Processing</b> Wastewater as a media. The focus {{of this study is}} to determine the best concentrations of microalgae Scenedesmus sp. in raw wastewater in terms of kinetics of cells growth rates. The study verified that concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml of microalgae gives the highest specific growth rates of biomass at 0. 4488 day- 1 and 1720 cells/ml/day compare to the other concentrations, while the lowest occurred at concentration of 1 × 103 cells/ml at 0. 4108 day- 1 and 14. 9 cells/ml/day. The result shows the different concentration of microalgae Scenedesmus sp. culturing in Industrial Food Processing Wastewater influence the cells growth of biomass and the optimum were obtained at concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml which suggested use for Industrial <b>Meat</b> Food <b>Processing</b> Wastewater Treatment purposed.

40|$|A {{combination}} of salt (NaCl) high concentration and curing salt was investigated for {{their role in}} warmed-over flavor (WOF) and color changes during charqui <b>meats</b> <b>processing.</b> WOF was measured by TBARS method in uncured charqui meat (CH) and in cured charqui known in Brazil as Jerked beef (JB). WOF occurred substantially in CH and sodium nitrite was able to inhibit 40 - 45 % (p< 0. 05) in JB samples stored for 30 days. Color parameters also changed as evaluated by CIELAB system. The a*/b * ratio showed that CH samples presented brown color indicating the formation of metmyoglobin (Fe 3 +) whilst JB samples presented deep red color an indication of nitrosylmyoglobin (Fe 2 +) formation. Under cooking, a*/b * ratio indicated the presence of denatured metmyoglobin (Fe 3 +) in CH and formation of nitrosylmyochromogen (Fe 2 +) in JB samples. The actual iron state influenced the color of charqui meat and apparently nitrite was able to chelat Fe ions, thus inhibiting development of WOF.
