The city is home to Utah State University Eastern, {{as well as the}} USU Eastern Prehistoric <b>Museum.</b> <b>Price</b> {{is located}} within short {{distances}} of both Nine Mile Canyon and the Manti-La Sal National Forest. Price is noted as a mining town, as well as for its history as a religious and ethnically diverse community, very atypical for Utah.

A large qualitative study on <b>museum</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions was conducted between 2001 and 2009, based on thirty case studies in Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France Australia.

The hybrid model varies according to unequal organisational learning of the strategic role of pricing in the international museum community. A discussion about these results enables us to understand how this hybrid pricing model in contemporary museums denotes their hybrid transitional identity. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The museum {{sector has}} {{undergone}} considerable {{change in the}} last few decades, which has been a result of both internal and external forces. The topic of <b>pricing</b> in <b>museums,</b> however, has attracted little interest from researchers in the field despite the sector 2 ̆ 7 s need to understand it better. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge. Results of a comprehensive literature review on pricing highlight that the topic of <b>pricing</b> in <b>museums</b> is problematic, as a range of issues, social, political and often value-laden, must be considered before pricing decisions can be made. The study highlights that there is diversity in the sector with regard to <b>pricing,</b> but that <b>museums</b> generally adopt a unilateral approach to pricing. Researchers in entrepreneurial marketing have noted that conventional pricing theory is being turned on its head and they argue that deciding what prices to charge represents one of the more entrepreneurial strategies for organisations. This study indicates that, within the context of museums, marketers are failing to recognise and capitalise on such pricing opportunities. Approaches to setting multiple <b>museum</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies, depending on the market context, are proposed in this paper. In this way, knowledge of <b>museum</b> <b>pricing</b> can optimise the organisational outcomes of museums while continuing to meet their social responsibilities. <br /...|$|R

If there is something significant or special of the main exhibit, it should be introduced here. At this point the visitor should have a good feeling what the museum is generally about (i.e. museum of Titanic artifacts).

50|$|The New Palace was the {{official}} royal residence from 1922 until 1934, when {{the royal family}} moved to the newly-built Belgrade residence in Dedinje and King Alexander assigned the old one to the Royal Museum, subsequently renamed the Museum of Prince Paul. The Museum {{was one of the}} most important cultural institutions in the kingdom and the contemporaries rated it among the most modern European museums. The essential phenomenological aspect of the <b>Museum</b> of <b>Price</b> Paul was the museum display itself. On the ground floor were exhibited prehistoric, ancient and medieval artifacts; the first floor was assigned for monuments of national culture and 19th-century Yugoslav art; on the second floor was the collection of contemporary European art, in which domestic artists occupied an important place. The New Palace housed the Museum of Prince Paul until 1948, when, under a different system of government, it was assigned a different role.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the theme of}} the audiences' perceptions of free admission in national French museums and monuments. The results show that, from an individual perspective, perceptions of free admission are linked to perceptions of price, of money and of payment, hence complementing perceptions expressed in a collective perspective (a symbolic, political measure, causing either adhesion or rejection). These perspectives are generally put forward by both advocates and opponents of the measure in their discussions. This different vision of free admission has managerial implications for managers of museums and monuments. Free admission, <b>price,</b> <b>museums</b> and monuments, multiangulation...|$|R

40|$|If a <b>museum</b> faces a <b>price</b> {{inelastic demand}} and twin targets of a {{minimum number of}} visits and a minimum revenue, those targets need not be compatible. This paper explores the {{implications}} of such targets and shows that their compatibility depends critically on the admission price-elasticity. If the targets are incompatible {{it may be possible}} to engineer compatibility by shifting the demand curve. However, if the demand shift (eg resulting from advertising or improving the quality of the visitor experience) requires resourcing and is to be self-financing, it may or may not be possible to bring about compatibility.

Various pricing schemes are being discussed {{with the aim of}} reaching these goals. The classical ones are entry prices and free entry.

40|$|What {{perceptions}} of free admission to museums and monuments do French visiting and non-visiting audiences have ? What {{are the consequences}} of such perceptions on individuals' perceptions, visit-planning and behavior patterns in museums and monuments ? Research conducted between 2002 and 2003 tried {{to answer these questions}} by multiangulation applied to data production and analysis. Results show that free admission alter the {{perceptions of}} museums and monuments, it is secondary in planning and implementation of visit-planning, and finally it can spark a learning process from the visit that results in the appropriation of a free admission scheme.

40|$|Museums Worldwide {{are facing}} {{financial}} exigencies {{and are being}} forced to rely on earned income, including admission fees, to finance their activities. Using data from the 1989 Museum Surveywe estimate demand functions for seven types of museums in the United States.

This study presents the first general empirical evidence on factors influencing the demand for museum services.

40|$|The “free access” policy {{designed}} by the British Government has encouraged interest in museum financial issues. We define a principal-agent model for museum administration where there are two income sources: public grants and ticket revenues. This model allows us to define the optimal contract determining public grants, ticket prices, budget and managerial effort. We find a theoretical explanation for the inelastic pricing strategy commonly adopted in cultural economics. We further find that museum manager should never have any control over the price of tickets. The model can also be applied to other institutions, such as schools or NGOs, which are able to raise funds directly from private (e. g., ticket revenues or membership fees) or public sources.
