40|$|Grain size {{parameters}} {{are the basic}} elements to describe and express seafloor sediments, which deeply influence acoustic and physical-mechanical properties of seafloor sediment. Statistical analysis of the results in the paper indicates that several parameters in graininess of the seafloor sediments, including porosity, dry-density, medium diameter, <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> and particle shape, are most closely related. Here, porosity has a stronger linear relation with dry-density, but a weaker linear relation with the <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> or the medium diameter.

30|$|Firstly, while TEM image {{analysis}} gives a number size distribution, the SAXS measurement gives volume size distribution. So, in SAXS measurement, the mean volume of sphere is measured {{which is then}} converted into the corresponding mean diameter of nanoparticle.

This {{can be explained by}} assuming three spherical nanoparticles with diameters 2, 6, and 10  nm. According to TEM {{image analysis}} with a number distribution, the <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> is 6  nm while with SAXS measurement, which is volume distribution, the <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> is 7.42  nm (the three spherical nanoparticles with diameters 2, 6, and 10  nm correspond to volumes of 4.18, 113.04, and 523.33  nm 3, respectively.

The effect of the solvent flow rate and the <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> of dittany on the extraction yield was also investigated at 100 bar and 40 °C.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} nonionic emulsifiers on the physicochemical characteristics of astaxanthin nanodispersions produced by an emulsification/evaporation technique were studied. The emulsifiers used were polysorbates (Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 40, Polysorbate 60 and Polysorbate 80) and sucrose esters of fatty acids (sucrose laurate, palmitate, stearate and oleate).

The Taylor-expansion moment method (TEMOM) is employed to study dynamics of nanoparticles with Brownian motion, based on the flow field from numerical simulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop and test novel {{food-grade}} nanodispersions, such as nanoemulsions and solid lipid nanoparticles, for the encapsulation, protection and delivery of bioactive lipophilic food components. Initially, the impact of system composition and homogenization conditions on the formation of nanoemulsions using a high pressure homogenizer (microfluidizer) was examined. The <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> decreased with increasing homogenization pressure and number of passes, with a linear log-log relationship between <b>mean</b> <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> and homogenization pressure. Surfactants emulsifiers formed smaller droplets than protein emulsifiers, which was attributed {{to their ability to}} rapidly adsorb to the droplet surfaces during homogenization.

Magnetic measurements prove superparamagnetic behaviour above 160 K (350 K) for the coated (uncoated) sample.

30|$|For {{optimization}} purposes, 15 {{batches of}} PLA R 208 Doc-loaded oily core NCs were prepared using the above method. As shown in Table S 1 in Additional file 1, the lowest {{value of the}} NCs' diameter was obtained with F 6 (115.6 nm), while the largest <b>particle</b> <b>diameter</b> was obtained with F 9 (582.8 nm). The PDI ranged from 0.004 to 0.318 (F 14 and F 9, respectively). It {{was found that the}} <b>particle</b> <b>mean</b> <b>diameter</b> is strongly dependent to the polymer amount. Indeed, at a low PLA amount (40 mg), the <b>particle</b> <b>mean</b> <b>diameter</b> increases with increasing drug amount (see F 9 versus F 10, P < 0.0001). This might be {{explained by the fact that}} the lipophilic feature tends to decrease the leakage of the drug into the external aqueous medium, leading to improved drug content in the nanoparticles (which is consistent with the previous report) [19]. However, at a high PLA amount (360 mg), the <b>particle</b> <b>mean</b> <b>diameter</b> decreases with increasing drug amount (see F 4 versus F 5, P < 0.0001). The latter was not consistent with the commonly published report and might be a result of drug solubilization in the polymer matrix, leading to decrease the <b>particle</b> <b>mean</b> <b>diameter.</b> Thus, the solubilization capacity of PLA has a great importance in the preparation of the Doc-loaded NCs.|$|R
