50|$|Flux braking {{is another}} method, based on <b>motor</b> <b>losses,</b> for {{handling}} an overrunning load. When braking {{in the drive}} system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the magnetizing current component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the direct torque control principle. With DTC the inverter is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified speed ramp. This is very different to the DC injection braking typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a calorimeter that is suitable for measuring power <b>losses</b> in electrical <b>motors</b> of up to 300 kW (402 hp). Refined from the two previous generations, this calorimeter is of air-cooled open type. Accurate control of the air flow rate and temperature gradients between the inside and outside walls of the calorimeter ensures that a repeatable and durable measurement environment is achieved. During the design stage, attention is focused on heat leakage prevention and reduction in the length of the testing procedures. Heat leakage is mitigated by appropriate insulation and active temperature control over all walls and connection ports. In selecting the materials for the structure, lightweight aluminum and polystyrene are used in sandwich form to reduce the thermal time constant and, thus, the operational time for the calorimeter to reach its equilibrium. After the calorimeter is commissioned, further reduction in the lengthy test procedures is realized by boosting the initial power loss value of the motor under test. That is, some additional resistive heaters are installed inside the calorimeter and operate in conjunction with the test motor. This push-pull technique can guarantee a constant combined power loss during operation, which is assumed to be the final value of <b>motor</b> <b>loss.</b> By predefining a suitable <b>motor</b> <b>loss</b> and a tolerance, it is possible to dynamically control the input power to the dc heaters from the start and to shut down the heaters once the <b>motor</b> <b>loss</b> value enters the tolerance selected.

The calorimeter designed and built is capable of measuring heat losses of up to 1 kW with an overall accuracy better than 3 %.

Existing correlations {{have been unable to}} explain the magnitude of this additional 'compression loss', but it can account for up to 50 % of the power delivered to the gas. It appears that even a modest decrease could significantly improve the efficiency of future machines. One problem inherent in studying this effect is the complex geometry of cryocoolers.
