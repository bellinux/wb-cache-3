40|$|The project {{involved}} performing literature {{reviews of}} various mathematical <b>models</b> of <b>freezing</b> in biological tissues and proceeding {{to develop a}} mathematical <b>model</b> on <b>freezing</b> of biological tissue.

The exact solution was obtained by introducing an exponential integral function and a dimensionless transcendental constant (λ) to solve the problem.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{freezing}} of video on quality as experienced by users. Two types of freezes are investigated. First a freeze where the image pauses, so no frames were lost (frame halt). In {{the second type of}} freeze, the image freezes and skips that part of the video (frame drop). Measuring Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was done by subjective tests. Video sequences of 20 seconds were displayed for four types of content, to a total of 23 test subjects. We conclude there is no difference in the perceived quality between frame drops and frame halts. Therefore one <b>model</b> for single <b>freezes</b> was constructed. According to this <b>model</b> the acceptable <b>freezing</b> time (MOS> 3. 5) is 0. 36 seconds. Pastrana – Vidal et al. (2004) suggested a relations ip between the probability of detection and the duration of the dropped frames. They also found {{that it is important to}} consider not only the duration of the freeze but also the number of freeze occurrences. Using their relationship between the total duration of the freeze and the number of occurrences, we propose a <b>model</b> for multiple <b>freezes,</b> based upon our <b>model</b> for single <b>freeze</b> occurrences.

40|$|The {{frozen food}} {{industry}} is a billion dollar industry that demands efficient manufacturing of consumer products. Through <b>modeling</b> the <b>freezing</b> within a fish fillet, the process of storing and distributing this product is better understood. The purpose of this experiment {{is to determine the}} time to freeze a fillet of tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) of known shape and properties. Then through utilizing the fillet temperature, the shelf life or freshness is determined through a consumer based freshness test that provides a nominal shelf life for common species, including tilapia. Another objective is to determine the bacteria concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, common bacteria found on fish and other seafoods, during and after freezing. Using Gambit and FIDAP, a three dimensional slab of 10 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm was modeled in a - 4 ?C freezer where each side was exposed to convection except for the bottom which was simulated as resting on a surface (a shelf in the freezer). This fillet <b>model</b> <b>froze</b> in ~ 45 minutes and the shelf life was determined to be 22 days, according to the industry freshness chart by Dr. Joe Regenstein.

Plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry are optional, and some delegates elect to use padding. As the Miss Venezuela broadcast lasts up to four hours long, with countless musical numbers and dances, rehearsals require weeks of preparation. Contestants also participate in official photoshoots (lately done by Iván Dumont, after several years by Daniel Alonso) and also fittings by fashion designers. The evening gowns worn by candidates are a major source of politicking by Venezuela's domestic fashion houses, with top designers such as Mayela Camacho, Ángel Sanchez, Durant & Diego, Jose María Almeida, and Gionni Stracia selecting candidates that they will dress for the final night, while other, newer designers compete to present designs for the pageant. As a general rule the evening gowns are always custom-designed for each of the candidates on the final night, and always by a Venezuelan designer. By tradition, Nidal Nouaihed dresses the representatives of his home state of Zulia (Miss Costa Oriental, Miss Peninsula Goajira, Miss Zulia); Ángel Sanchez designs the gown for Miss Trujillo; Jose María Almeida designs the dress for Miss Mérida and the national costume for Miss Venezuela to Miss Universe. Only in 1999, 26 different designers took part of the evening gown competition, one candidate for each one. Also, in 2006, for the first time ever, the designers appeared on stage with the delegates, showing their fabulous creations.

40|$|Dark energy must {{cluster in}} order to be {{consistent}} with the equivalence principle. The background evolution can be effectively modelled by either a scalar field or by a barotropic fluid. The fluid model can be used to emulate perturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks down at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy perturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and <b>freezing</b> <b>models.</b> The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes. In <b>freezing</b> <b>models,</b> the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times. For thawing models, the dark energy equation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times and begins to deviate from it only at late times. Since the dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes,the dark energy perturbations too evolve differently. In <b>freezing</b> <b>models,</b> since the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant difference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological constant model. In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ from the cosmological constant only at late times. This difference provides an additional handle to distinguish between these classes of models and this difference should manifest itself in the ISW effect.
