5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} {{to a less}} frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and video editor career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by Intel and its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{nickname}} culé for a Barcelona supporter {{is derived}} from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> that focused on Spanish and English online media.|$|E

25|$|Petraeus had a {{strategy}} to influence military conditions by using the press relations effectively in the theater and in Washington, according to critics of the general's military career after his fall from power. On November 13, 2012, Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb, C.I.A. analyst and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity co-founder Ray McGovern, and investigative journalist Gareth Porter appeared on Al Jazeera English. Together they assessed the general's extensive military-medi{{a strategy}} linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts, to his downfall with his female biographer. Critics said that the Petraeus <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> would prove damaging for American policy in the future because of omissions and distorted interpretations that Washington policymakers, other experts, and the American public accepted from Petraeus's media contacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E
40|$|Attention {{to the use}} of {{new media}} by social {{movements}} rose rapidly following groundbreaking global protests: The Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and the "Indignados" Movement in Spain. However, determinism and rhetoric of newness have led to phrases like "Twitter Revolution," while tools and gadgets often overshadow human agency and grassroots efforts. In fact, <b>media</b> and grassroots <b>strategies</b> have worked hand-in-hand and have been pivotal to social movements throughout history. Through a comparative analysis of the Farm Workers Movement of the 1960 s and the contemporary Immigrant Youth Movement, this work examines <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> by emphasizing concrete media practices of movement actors. With a grounded approach that incorporates participant observation, semi-structured interviews, archival research, and literature reviews, this study provides cross-historical insight into <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> in social movements. Particularly, this work covers external and internal <b>media</b> <b>strategies,</b> <b>media</b> practice, framing, community media practice, and capacity building. It concludes with a comparative analysis of how movement <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> are related to movement goals, aims, and outcomes. by Rogelio Alejandro Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)

25|$|Engagement {{in social}} media {{for the purpose of}} a social <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content (digital photos, digital videos, text) and conversations, as well as the sharing of content and {{information}} from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging Traditional media such as TV news shows are limited to one-way interaction with customers or 'push and tell' where only specific information is given to the customer with few or limited mechanisms to obtain customer feedback. Traditional media such as paper newspapers, of course, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor, but this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open, as participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer (or citizen).|$|E

2500|$|Three {{different}} {{covers for}} Game Informers first {{preview of the}} game for its October 2010 issue were collaborations between Irrational and the magazine, envisioning what a video game magazine would be like in the early 20th century. Each cover, drawn by Irrational's Rob Waters, is inspired by the cover artwork from The Saturday Evening Post and includes fictional advertisements based on early 20th century variants, including one redrawn from a public domain ad. Kevin Gifford of Gamasutra praised these covers, commented that such a diversion for a game magazine cover represents a paradigm change, in that [...] "developers are beginning to appreciate what magazines can do for their <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> that online can't", and that because Game Informer does need to vie for space at newsstands, is able to take more creative approaches with such covers as opposed to cover layers designed to gain maximum exposure.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of employing social media in marketing is as a communications tool that makes the companies accessible to those interested in their product and makes them visible {{to those who have}} no knowledge of their products. These companies use social media to create buzz, and learn from and target customers. It's the only form of marketing that can finger consumers at each and every stage of the consumer decision journey. Marketing through social media has other benefits as well. Of the top 10 factors that correlate with a strong Google organic search, seven are social media dependent. This means that if brands are less or non-active on social media, they tend to show up less on Google searches. While platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ have a larger number of monthly users, the visual media sharing based mobile platforms, however, garner a higher interaction rate in comparison and have registered the fastest growth and have changed the ways in which consumers engage with brand content. Instagram has an interaction rate of 1.46% with an average of 130 million users monthly as opposed to Twitter which has a [...]03% interaction rate with an average of 210 million monthly users. [...] Unlike traditional media that are often cost-prohibitive to many companies, a social <b>media</b> <b>strategy</b> does not require astronomical budgeting.|$|E
40|$|Social media, {{even though}} a new phenomenon, has gained much {{interest}} {{in the last decade}} and has been a frequent topic of researchers. Sport marketing has also been a popular topic in academia, especially in North America. This thesis will address the use of social media in Nordic ice hockey clubs, including the exploration of their social <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> and effectiveness. Previous research has not concentrated on ice hockey in Europe, nor has it examined their social <b>media</b> <b>strategies.</b> The study is seen to be necessary, especially given the large differences in the European and North American sport cultures and business models. The research was conducted through a qualitative multiple-case study by gathering data from both secondary sources as well as through semi-structured face-to-face interviews carried out with ten ice hockey clubs from both Sweden and Finland. The questions of the interviews were formed by the concepts derived from previous literature and the authors’ own experience. The results indicate that Nordic ice hockey clubs are still partly struggling with their social <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> and that with the implementation of a clear strategy, including segmentation, the clubs would be {{able to take advantage of}} the relationship marketing and branding possibilities offered by social media. In line with this, the authors argue that the social <b>media</b> <b>strategies</b> of ice hockey clubs are not as effective as they could be and suggest further actions for managers to achieve higher social media effectiveness...|$|R
