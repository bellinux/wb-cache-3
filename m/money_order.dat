25|$|With the 1965 {{publication}} of Le mandat, précédé de Vehi-Ciosane (The <b>Money</b> <b>Order</b> and White Genesis), Sembène's emphasis began to shift. Just {{as he had}} once vociferously attacked the racial and economic oppression of the colonial government, with this pair of novellas, he turned his sights on the corrupt African elites that followed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mail coach}} ran in 1784, {{operating}} between Bristol and London. Delivery staff received uniforms {{for the first}} time in 1793, and the Post Office Investigation Branch was established; it is the world's oldest recognised criminal investigations authority. The first mail train ran in 1830, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Post Office's <b>money</b> <b>order</b> system was introduced in 1838.|$|E

25|$|A regular seaborne {{mail service}} was {{established}} between Varna and Constantinople. In response to demands made by Florence Nightingale, {{a method of}} transmitting money was devised to allow troops to transfer monies back to their families {{at home in the}} United Kingdom. This was designed to prevent drunkenness and became the world's first International <b>Money</b> <b>Order</b> Service. In its first month of operation £7,000 was remitted by the British troops.|$|E

When Kanti Chandra Mitra happened to be absent, he signed on <b>money</b> <b>order</b> receipts but the money was kept on the desk by the post man and picked up by Mitra when he came back. After 1872, he lived in Bharat Ashram with his wife and children.|$|E
25|$|In June 1881, Sadie sent {{a postal}} <b>money</b> <b>order</b> {{to her mother}} using the name Josephine Behan, and Wyatt Earp was still living with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock. The next month, in July 1881, Josephine Behan was {{reported}} to be leaving Tombstone by stage. But in August a Tombstone newspaper reported a letter waiting at the post office for Sadie Mansfield. Sadie was apparently no longer claiming to be Behan's wife.|$|E
50|$|In June 1966, bank {{officials}} at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. discovered that Robert Taliento, a teller at the bank, had cashed several forged <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> When he was {{questioned by the}} FBI, Taliento confessed that he had supplied John Giglio, the petitioner, with signature cards {{from one of the}} bank's customers, which Giglio used to forge $2,300 in <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> Taliento then processed the forged <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> through the bank.|$|R
50|$|Postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a bank cheque, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.|$|R

25|$|Unlike most {{political}} appointees, Montgomery Blair took personal {{charge of the}} department, organizing an efficient system for the army and navy and abolishing the franking privilege for postmasters. He originated the new practices of free mail delivery and the sorting of mail on railway cars. He developed the return-receipt system for accountability, and innovated the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> system for soldiers to send and receive money from the field. Blair sponsored the first International Postal Congress in Paris in 1863.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} few months, until April 1882, Sadie Mansfield is {{recorded}} in various newspapers as traveling {{back and forth between}} Tombstone and San Francisco several times. The Epitaph reported on February 27, 1882 that S. Mansfield of Tombstone was returning from the west with other passengers, passing through Colton, California. In March 1882, Sadie sent a postal <b>money</b> <b>order</b> to her mother, Mrs. H. Marcus, in San Francisco. She didn't use either Marcus or Behan as her name, but asked a friend to send the postal order for her.|$|E

50|$|Check cashersA check casher is {{a person}} whose primary {{business}} is the cashing of checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for a fee. (A license is not required when a person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> without charge, or when the person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged.) Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Banks under Article IX-A of the Banking Law.|$|R
50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> {{have limited}} {{acceptance}} {{in the insurance}} and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering.

50|$|The United States Postal Service {{began selling}} <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an {{alternative}} to sending currency through the postal system in order to reduce post office robberies, an idea instituted by Montgomery Blair who was Postmaster-General 1861-1864. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> were later offered by many more vendors than just the postal service as a means to pay bills and send money internationally where there were not reliable banking or postal systems. Companies that now offer <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions.|$|R
500|$|Throughout late 1916, the Mint was {{intensely}} busy first sharpening {{the design}} {{to be used}} in 1917, and then in large-scale preparation of dies to begin striking the new quarters on a massive scale once the new year began. [...] Small change was in great demand: [...] Mint officials had hoped not to strike any Barber pieces in 1916, but eventually had to do so in large quantities to satisfy the need. [...] Once new quarters were struck, fearing the new pieces would be hoarded (especially the low-mintage 1916 coin), von Engelken instructed that no pieces be released without his order. [...] Small quantities of the new quarters were available, however, to officials and to prominent numismatists. [...] MacNeil, who had not heard from the Mint about his coins since the formal acceptance of his dolphin design, read in the newspaper in early January that the Mint was starting to strike his quarters. [...] He wrote to von Engelken on January 6, enclosing a $5 <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> and was sent 20 of the new pieces. [...] After seeing what the Mint had done to his designs, MacNeil wrote again to von Engelken, criticizing the artistic nature of the changes in such strong terms that the Mint Director continued his embargo on the coins' release. [...] The sculptor pointed out, for example, that the lower position of the eagle made it appear about to land—with its talons in a position only assumed at great heights. [...] Von Engelken feared that should the sculptor's objections become public and not be addressed, the Mint would be exposed to ridicule. [...] MacNeil visited the Philadelphia Mint and its engraving department on January 10. [...] No records of his visit are extant, but von Engelken telephoned from Washington to Philadelphia the same day to ensure that the new quarters did not leave the Mint.|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, James Roe {{was convicted}} in the Old Bailey of forging a <b>money</b> <b>order.</b> Apparently Roe had {{expected}} to be left money by an uncle, Edward Roe, but a cousin had induced the uncle to make a will in the cousin's favour only {{a week before the}} uncle's death. After the uncle's death, Roe had produced a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for £6000 apparently made out to him from the uncle. [...] The cousin challenged the authenticity of the order, and Roe was charged with forgery. The prosecution's case mainly hinged upon evidence suggesting that the date stamp on the envelope in which the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> was claimed to have been sent had been faked. [...] Roe was found guilty and sentenced to ten years' penal labour. [...] According to Rica Erickson, his family always believed in his innocence.|$|E

At 11:21 am CST — while authorities were escorting Oswald through the police basement to an armored car that was to take him to the nearby county jail — Ruby stepped out from a crowd of reporters and fired a single round from his [...]38 revolver into Oswald's abdomen, fatally wounding him. Ruby was immediately subdued by agents and police. The shooting was broadcast live nationally, and millions of television viewers witnessed it. Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07p.m.|$|E
