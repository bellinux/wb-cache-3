If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is <b>made,</b> <b>something</b> will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E

Nascent computer networks (mainly FidoNet), distributing electronic copies of his works, also helped to create demand for printed versions. Another contribution was his writing style, combining intricate but captivating plots with deep intrigue and concentrated action.|$|E

25|$|The runestone {{has three}} sides of which two are {{decorated}} with images. On one side, there is an animal that is the prototype of the runic animals that would be commonly engraved on runestones, and on another side there is Denmark's oldest depiction of Jesus. Shortly after this stone had been <b>made,</b> <b>something</b> happened in Scandinavia's runic tradition. Scores of chieftains and powerful Norse clans consciously tried to imitate King Harald, and from Denmark a runestone wave spread northwards through Sweden. In most districts, the fad died out after a generation, but, in the central Swedish provinces of Uppland and Södermanland, the fashion lasted into the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Memoirs written {{after the}} period of captivity are of an entirely {{different}} sort. These later writings became the place where a profound reflection on the situation could be <b>made,</b> <b>something</b> less suitable for the daily diaries. Following the example of Gaston Riou in France, some prisoners became writers or resumed their occupation as writers. In 1924, Thierry Sandre won the Prix Goncourt for three volumes, {{one of which was}} his captivity narrative, Le Purgatoire. Some of these authors entered the literary tradition: in Le Purgatoire, for instance, Sandre dedicates each chapter to influential members of the era’s literary society such as Claude Farrère or Christian-Frogé, secretary of the Association des écrivains combattants. Robert d'Harcourt, who had also been a prisoner, published a memoir that was reprinted several times. Jacques Rivière is one of the authors who thought seriously about the meaning of captivity. In his book L’Allemand (“The German”), reprinted in 1924, the reader finds a thorough psychological and philosophical analysis of the former enemy.|$|E

500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall <b>made</b> <b>something</b> out of nothing. Here {{he does the}} opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Illmatic and It Was Written {{were both}} selling {{at a rate}} of over 3,000 copies a week, while Nastradamus was earning an average of little more than 2,000 copies a week, despite its {{relative}} newness. Both I Am… and Nastradamus received further criticism for their commercially oriented sound. Reflecting this widespread perception in the hip hop community and adding to his ongoing feud with Jay-Z at the time, Jay-Z mocked him in the song [...] "Takeover" [...] (2001) for assuming a [...] "Pablo Escobar" [...] persona and having a [...] "one hot album [...] every ten year average". Nas, however, <b>made</b> <b>something</b> of a comeback with his fifth album Stillmatic (2001) and the follow-up God's Son (2002), which both sold in excess of 1 million copies. Afterwards, his subsequent albums tended to receive more positive reviews, including the platinum-selling Street's Disciple (2004) and his untitled ninth album (2008). Nevertheless, It Was Written has remained as Nas's best-selling album.|$|E

The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful, the outer walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder, made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson. They drew up specifications for a steel sphere [...] in diameter, weighing [...] and capable of handling a pressure of [...] After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture.

500|$|When he {{released}} his {{third and fourth}} studio albums, I Am… and Nastradamus (1999), which underwent editing due to bootlegging of the recording sessions, many fans and critics feared that his career was deteriorating, as both albums received further criticism for their commercially oriented sound. Reflecting this widespread perception in the hip hop community and adding to his ongoing feud with Nas at the time, Jay-Z mocked him in the song [...] "Takeover" [...] (2001) for having a [...] "one hot album [...] every ten year average". A journalist writing for The Source commented on the demanding legacy of Nas' debut: [...] "Blame excellence, blame perfection and aggression. Blame one of hip-hop's most beautiful moments for the prison that traps Nasir Jones today – blame Illmatic." [...] Nas, however, <b>made</b> <b>something</b> of a comeback with his fifth album Stillmatic (2001) and the acclaimed follow-up God's Son (2002), as well as The Lost Tapes (2002), a compilation of previously unreleased tracks from the I Am… and Nastradamus sessions. Afterwards, his subsequent albums have all been well received by critics. Nevertheless, most fans have regarded Illmatic as his definitive album.|$|E
500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s <b>made</b> <b>something</b> all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E

[...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "As eye-popping as Nemo's peepers and as eccentric as this little fish with asymmetrical fins." [...] David Germain of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation." [...] The 3D re-release prompted a retrospective on the film nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger described it as [...] "a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic." [...] On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by [...] "the dimensionality of the oceanic deep" [...] where [...] "the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go".|$|E
500|$|Established bands <b>made</b> <b>something</b> of a {{comeback}} in the mid-1980s. After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple {{returned with the}} classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track [...] "Jump", which reached {{number one on the}} singles chart and remained there for several weeks. Heart, after floundering {{during the first half of}} the decade, made {{a comeback}} with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit. The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades. Among the first were ZZ Top, who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles, beginning with [...] "Gimme All Your Lovin'" [...] (1983), which helped their albums Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively. Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads, including REO Speedwagon with [...] "Keep on Loving You" [...] (1980) and [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling" [...] (1984), Journey with [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...] (1981) and [...] "Open Arms" [...] (1982), Foreigner's [...] "I Want to Know What Love Is", Scorpions' [...] "Still Loving You" [...] (both from 1984), Heart’s [...] "What About Love" [...] (1985) and [...] "These Dreams" [...] (1986), and Boston's [...] "Amanda" [...] (1986).|$|E
