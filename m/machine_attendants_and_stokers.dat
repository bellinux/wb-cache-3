40|$|Results are {{presented}} of the YF- 12 Lockalloy Ventral Fin Program which {{was carried out}} by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation - Advanced Development Projects for the joint NASA/USAF YF- 12 Project. The primary purpose of the program was to redesign and fabricate the ventral fin of the YF- 12 research airplane (to reduce flutter) using Lockalloy, and alloy of beryllium and aluminum, as a major structural material. A secondary purpose, was to make a material characterization study (thermodynamic properties, corrosion; fatigue tests, mechanical properties) of Lockalloy to validate the design of the ventral fin and expand the existing data base on this material. All significant information pertinent to the design and fabrication of the ventral fin is covered. Emphasis throughout is given to Lockalloy fabrication <b>and</b> <b>machining</b> techniques <b>and</b> <b>attendant</b> personnel safety precautions. Costs are also examined. Photographs of tested alloy specimens are shown along with the test equipment used...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{looks at}} the christian theory of science from a very {{specific}} context. The essay {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part two different (christian) theories of science, those of Dooyeweerd <b>and</b> <b>Stoker,</b> will be discussed. In the second part, these theories will be analysed against the background of recent developments in the theories of science and knowledge in the field of law and legal theory. The conclusion from the first part is that christian scholarship (and, conversely, a christian university) {{has nothing to do with}} the morality of either students or lecturers. It should also be clear that one cannot speak of “the” christian paradigm of science, but that there are various theories and paradigms. In the second part various problems with these two theories are discussed. These include the objectivist stance of both Dooyeweerd <b>and</b> <b>Stoker,</b> Dooyeweerd’s archimedean point of departure <b>and</b> <b>Stoker’s</b> use of socalled scriptural truths. These problems are highlighted by recent developments in legal theory of which christian scholarship must take cognisance...|$|R
