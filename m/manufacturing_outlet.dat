50|$|On June 18, 1986, after a {{purchase}} of the 51% majority stake of SEAT followed by the increase of its share up to 75% on December 23, the Volkswagen Group became the major shareholder of SEAT. On December 18, 1990 the Volkswagen Group acquired 99.99% ownership of the company, thus making SEAT the first non-German wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Fulfilling Hahn's expectations, SEAT not only made a profit two years after Volkswagen bought a majority of its stock, but also provided a low-cost <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outlet</b> for other VW group models, contributing up to 15.2% of the VW group's total output in 1989 — {{as well as an}} opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited (at that time) Spanish market under the SEAT, VW and Audi names.|$|E

50|$|During the 1870s Toowoomba {{consolidated}} {{its status}} as the main urban centre of the Darling Downs. The arrival of the Main Line railway in 1867 secured the town's development and subsequently made it the hub for the Southern and Western railways. The economy diversified to include numerous small-scale <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outlets,</b> {{while the majority of}} administrative, service and other government and education functions for the surrounding region were centred on the town. Toowoomba's progress was reflected in improvements to the physical environment. Important capital works were commenced or completed including the draining of the swamps, improved water supply, gasworks for lighting, extensive tree plantings and the initial development of Queen's Park. Earlier temporary structures were increasingly replaced with more permanent and impressive buildings.|$|R

40|$|The Philippines {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{pharmaceutical}} markets in the ASEAN region, next only to Indonesia and Thailand. It is a lifeline to thousands of Filipino workers and a significant contributor in terms of value of output. This industry {{is one of the}} fastest growing industries in the country. Meanwhile, its output, drugs and medicines, account for 46 percent of the total medical out-of-pocket expenses of Philippine households. For poorer people, this percentage goes up to 55 percent. Making essential drugs and medicines more affordable especially to the poor and underserved is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is therefore essential to examine the profile of the pharmaceutical industry in the country to better understand the supply chain of drugs and medicines for policy formulation purposes. Using administrative data from agencies that have regulative powers over the industry, a profile of the Philippine pharmaceutical industry was developed. As of December 2009, the Food and Drug Administration 28 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s records show that there are 284 drug manufacturers, 438 drug traders, 634 drug importers, 4, 719 drug distributors of which 3, 956 are wholesalers, and 32, 538 retail <b>outlets.</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> is dominated by multinational brand originator giants and numerous local generics/branded generics producers. Meanwhile, trading is done by few large companies and thousands of small retail outlets. The industry players are diverse and formulating policies therefore must take into consideration how each player may be affected by policy issuances...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} manufacturing conditions and polymer ratio on water permeability and morphology of free-films. A novel spray method for producing ethyl cellulose (EC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) free-films was developed where several process parameters was controlled. The process was optimised by pre-spraying solvent until the system reached a steady-state temperature. This minimised the variation of outlet air temperature to < 2. 5 °C. Coating time was approximately 4 minutes excluding drying. Free-films were produced using 94 wt% solvent (95 %-ethanol) and 6 wt% polymer. The amount of HPC in the films was varied (wt% HPC defined as HPC/(HPC+EC) * 100). Films with 30 - 40 - 50 - 57 wt% HPC were studied. Phase diagrams was constructed to study the phase transformation of polymer mixtures. Results show that all polymer mixtures with HPC content above 30 wt% were phase separated prior to film manufacturing. Temperature {{had an effect on}} the polymer phase transformation. In the phase diagram, the 2 -phase area was larger for temperatures above 40 °C. The investigated <b>manufacturing</b> conditions were <b>outlet</b> air temperature (°C) and spray rate (g/min). Outlet air temperature was controlled by adjusting the inlet air temperature. The films were characterized by measuring water permeability (m 2 /s). Cross section structure of the films was analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). FITC-HPC was added for enhanced contrast between the domains. Higher outlet air temperature gave higher water permeability of the film whereas higher spray rate gave lower water permeability. The outlet air temperature had an impact on evaporation rate. The evaporation rate together with spray rate affected the solidification and hence the structure of the film. Images show that longer solidification time smeared the domains into larger domains. Lower water permeability was caused by less connectivity between the pores. In conclusion, experiments show that water permeability of EC/HPC free-films was highly dependent on the manufacturing conditions. ...|$|R
