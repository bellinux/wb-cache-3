5000|$|The Fender Performer bass was {{a uniquely}} styled bass guitar, {{designed}} by John Page, {{renowned for its}} extremely slender neck (narrower than Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars). The Japanese Performer Standard has an alder body, with a bolt-on 34" [...] 24-fret micro-tilt adjustable maple neck and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard {{as opposed to the}} United States-made Performer Elite, which sports an ebony fretboard. Controls are: Tone, Volume, Pickup Selector Switch and TBX Circuit Control (Treble Bass eXpander). The latter provided the same tonal range as the Jazz Bass between 0 and 5, with the range 5-10 providing significantly brighter sound - oriented towards solo playing and particularly suiting the sharp attack needed for a slap bass playing style. Both basses were available in Burgundy <b>Mist,</b> <b>Gun</b> Metal Blue, Candy Green, White and Tobacco Sunburst. All finishes were metallic except for the sunburst. Both versions featured a number of minor features underlying the 'high end' design including rubber inserts around the volume and tone controls, a high-quality fully enclosed jack socket, a then new and contemporary Fender logo, sculpted pickups marked with an (original) Fender logo, felt washers to prevent the strap buttons marking the body and individual intonation adjustment for each string as standard (many P-Basses at this time had just two bridge pieces).|$|E
50|$|Peach Beach Splash is a third-person shooter {{in which}} players control kunoichi (female ninjas) from various {{games in the}} Senran Kagura series, using {{different}} types of water guns with different abilities: for example, the single hand gun consumes little water, and shoots ricocheting water bullets, and the shower gun continually sprays a short-range water <b>mist.</b> Each water <b>gun</b> has two modes the player can switch between: for instance, the water balloon grenade launcher's balloons can be set to either explode or bounce upon impact, and the sniper rifle can be set to either being powerful with a narrow lock-on range, or half as powerful with a wide lock-on range. In addition to water gun moves, players can use short-range moves that {{are more difficult to}} use, but that cause a lot of damage and push the opponent back. Players finish off opponents by activating a Kunekune Finish, in which they soak the opponent in water while aiming at their breasts and buttocks. Battles are fought in different arenas, including beaches, water fronts, and pirate ships.|$|R
