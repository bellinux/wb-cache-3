The research methodology adopted in this paper involves the use of questionnaires administered to various professionals in the industry. The research revealed that there is a form of relationship that exists between pre-contract administration and claims management. The research also shows that administrative and socio-cultural factors, such as, absence <b>of</b> dedicated <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> experts, corruption and poor pre-contract documentation, respectively, amongst others, are mainly responsible for the knowledge gap in the industry.

40|$|Delays {{resulting}} from claims {{are a major}} source of disputes in construction projects. There are different classifications of claims. However, inherent in any claim is a quest for additional resources – material, time and/or cost. Construction contract claims increasingly constitute significant delays and are often accompanied by additional cost. Existing literature shows that 70 % of Nigerian projects suffered delay set-backs in their execution and reveals an average cost over-run of 17. 34 %. This research investigated the main factors affecting the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in the Nigerian construction industry and results obtained revealed that corruption, lack of claims management experts and procurement strategy, respectively, are the main factors affecting the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in the Nigerian construction industry. Given that corruption is a socio-cultural issue and insufficient claim managers is a human resource issue, the research found procurement strategy adopted in each project case to be the main operational issue affecting claims management in the industry. Consequently, the research developed a decision support system for selecting procurement strategy in order to enhance current industry practice. The passive implementation of the most convenient rather than the most suitable procurement strategy has led to the misfortune of so many projects in the Nigerian construction industry. The aftermath of this has been numerous contractual claims during project execution resulting in cost over-run, time over-run and poor project delivery. In extreme cases, where claims are left unresolved, it has led to arbitration, mediation, litigation and in some cases outright project abandonment. Pragmatic research paradigm was adopted for the study. This research also employed a mixed research methodology, with both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection for data analysis. The use of structured questionnaires and multiple case studies were also adopted in eliciting knowledge from industry practitioners using a snow-balling technique. An inductive and deductive approach was adopted in developing a strategic procurement decision support system capable of bridging existing knowledge gap(s) among industry practitioners. A total of 66 valid responses were collected through administering structured questionnaires to industry practitioners in two (2) separate surveys and 31 project case studies were further analysed. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by exploring the key factors affecting the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and developing a strategic procurement decision support system to enhance the successful delivery of construction projects. It is an academic work that provides greater insight as to the problems affecting claims management...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a familiar aspect of construction industry culture that we have dubbed 'the claims culture'. This is a culture of contract administration that lays {{a strong emphasis on}} the planning and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> The principal elements of the analysis are two sets of distinctions. The first comprises economic and occupational orders, referring to two kinds of control that are exercised over the construct ion process; predicated respectively on economic ownership and occupational competence. The second refers to contrasting attitudes towards relationships and problem solving within these orders: respectively 'distributive' and 'integrative'. The concepts of economic and occupational order entail further sub-categories. The various attitudes associated with these categories and sub-categories are described. They are assessed as to their consequences for change initiatives in the industry. Culture, Claims Management, Procurement, Ethnography, Grounded Theory,...|$|E
40|$|Background: Unlike {{the rest}} of the UK, Northern Ireland has only {{recently}} (2003) implemented legislation regarding the requirement for anti-bullying policies in the province's school system. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study was}} to ascertain the nature of the management of bully/victim problems across Northern Ireland schools prior to the enactment of legislation. Sample: From an exhaustive sampling frame of all 1329 schools in Northern Ireland (96 nursery, 910 primary, 167 secondary, 73 grammar, 54 special, 29 further education), a total of 285 schools replied to a questionnaire (20 nursery, 181 primary, 41 secondary, 26 grammar, 13 special, 3 further education, 1 non-specified), a return rate of 23. 11 %. Design and methods: A review of the literature and consultation with educational experts in Northern Ireland resulted in the development of an 'Audit' questionnaire designed to examine dissemination and implementation (or not) of Department of Education, or bespoke, discipline and anti-bullying policies; components of anti-bullying programmes; the communication of anti-bullying policies to the school community; staff training; reporting and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> of staff victimisation; sanctions against bullies; and homophobic bullying. Results: It was found that, in a legislative vacuum, the schools in Northern Ireland had been acting in a proactive manner regarding the management of such bully/victim problems (e. g., development and implementation of policies, effective communication strategies). Conclusions: These results provide a baseline from which the efficacy of subsequent legislation in Northern Ireland can be evaluated. Utilisation of the methodology adopted in this study would be beneficial in other jurisdictions in evaluations of knowledge, attitudes and management of bully/victim problems, either pre- or post-implementation of legislation...|$|E

40|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{research}} is order {{to answer questions about}} the number and characteristics of problems with claims collection and risk <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> collection. Research was done at thirty-two commercial banks in B&H (twenty-three having head office in FB&H and nine in RS). The current economic crisis and recession are affecting most countries and their economies; they wish to overcome it as soon as possible and with the fewest consequences. Problems with uncollected claims arise at the beginnings of a crisis; they announce the crisis and deepen it strongly. From this point of view, {{it can be said that}} uncollected claims are, at the same time, the cause and the consequence of economic crisis and stagnation. Uncollected claims issues exist in every country, in all economic systems and at any given time. The only variable is their extent and intensity. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, these problems are more visible than in other countries for many reasons and circumstances because there are no appropriate mechanisms for their removal. Moreover, the government authorities are not making an effort to implement certain measures to change and improve the present situation. The most obvious example of this are companies that exist, function and do business although they have not paid notes payable for months (or years); they are illiquid and because of them creditors cannot collect their claims. In this way, banking is also threatened. In some cases even instruments for ensuring collection of claims are of no use, and what is more, the legal system does not function properly so uncollected claims cannot even be collected by court proceedings. The reasons why banks in B&H cannot collect past due receivables are not only the consequence of economic crisis but are also caused by other reasons and different circumstances. The basic problem is that uncollected claims are not managed efficiently, that the legal state does not function, that the laws are not enforced, that legal regulations are not appropriate and that there are illiquid companies on the market as well as those which otherwise would not operate in a developed economy...|$|E

30|$|Analysis {{of a huge}} series <b>of</b> medmal {{insurance}} <b>claims</b> allows forensic pathologists, clinicians, {{and insurance}} companies to ponder the intrinsic risk of a specific clinical branch for medical malpractice claims. Malpractice claims {{are not the same}} as defined judicial judgements, as the former relate mainly to patients’ dissatisfaction whereas the latter relate to the ascertainment of the alleged clinical mistakes. Indeed, a malpractice claim is the invariable first step towards a hypothetical medmal blame, while the judicial judgement is its eventual outcome after potentially many years and various chances to resolve the claim extrajudicially. Therefore, the analysis of a series <b>of</b> malpractice <b>claims</b> (versus the analysis of a series of judicial judgements) leads to greater knowledge of the medmal phenomenon and all of its dynamics, knowledge that is also beneficial in the fields of forensic pathology and clinical risk management [5, 6]. Moreover, studies <b>of</b> the pre-trial <b>management</b> <b>of</b> malpractice <b>claims</b> can help to bridge the research gap between works describing the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> (as in the present investigation) and works analyzing final judicial judgements.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of interstate}} {{territorial}} conflict have recognized natural resources {{as one of}} the elements that makes many territories "salient " or valuable to the claimant states. These studies have generally treated all resources as equivalent, though, with no distinction made between issues based on their value or renewability.

We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for the scholarly understanding of natural resources, with respect to territorial claims as well as interstate conflict and cooperation more generally...|$|R
