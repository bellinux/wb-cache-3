An Iranian judoka, Arash Miresmaeili, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners.

Records indicate that the bulk of the <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and hunger in Poplar {{had to be}} funded from <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> by the borough itself under the Poor Law. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the 1921 conflict between government and the local councillors known as the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support. Ultimately, {{this led to the}} abolition of the Poor Laws through the Local Government Act 1929.|$|E

In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that any <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, {{there are}} 47 active {{members of the}} {{organization}} and the president is Suzette Venturini. The group meets on the third Tuesday of February, April, May, August, September, October and November in the Marble Hall of Mt. St. Peter Church. The meetings consist of discussing projects and praying together. The St. Anthony Guild is known for their visits to the home-bound of the parish at Christmas and Easter and also for their Tree of Angels Campaign. This campaign allows parishioners to purchase angels in memory of loved ones that are placed on the church's Christmas tree. The <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> from these angel ornaments is donated to children in need. The guild also has many entertaining fundraisers to raise money for their charity projects. Some of these include a dance for parishioners in the fall, bingo nights, and selling coupons for special shopping days at Macy's.|$|E
5|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the Holy Name Society of Mt. St. Peter Church {{has been working}} to inspire love, honor, and reverence for the holy name of Jesus Christ. The society also works to promote respect for the Catholic Church, loyalty to Mt. St. Peter Parish, and a life filled with good spiritual values that can be carried {{throughout}} family, education, and work. The Holy Name Society is strictly for Catholic men and was begun by Monsignor Fusco, who started the group in hopes of uniting men of the parish through service to others. Members of the society host a Mass and breakfast on the Sunday prior to Palm Sunday every year and an annual Golf Outing during the summer. <b>Money</b> <b>raised</b> at this these two events is donated to the parish to help aid in the costs of parish projects.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have {{banded together to}} form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government lobbying group to deal with issues that affect the fast-food industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.

5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E
5|$|John's son, King Henry III, {{assessed}} the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was {{to secure the}} consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied. The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3shillings per carucate. The assessment {{of the amount of}} lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct. Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the tax was sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer. The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed. The <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince Louis of France, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made {{the transition from a}} private institution to a state-supported university. <b>Money</b> <b>raised</b> through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|The Historic Chapels Trust {{obtained}} {{an estimate}} for the restoration, which amounted to £2.5m. Unable {{to meet the}} full amount, the Trust decided to undertake the restoration in phases.

Of the <b>money</b> <b>raised</b> for this, £262,500 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £200,000 from English Heritage, £250,000 from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and a further £20,000 was raised locally. The second phase of restoration commenced in August 2010 and was completed a year later. The Trust spent £600,000 restoring the galleries, staircases and pulpits, replacing the organ and renovating the exterior ironwork. Funds are currently being raised for the final phase of restoration, which will include installation of a new heating and lighting system.|$|E
