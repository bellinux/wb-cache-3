5|$|Soyuz TM-30 {{launched}} at 05:01:29 UT on April 4, 2000. Docking {{occurred on}} April 6 at 06:31:24 UT. Although the Soyuz docking system is automated under normal conditions, the final few meters {{of the approach}} to the station were executed in <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> The decision to switch to <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted docking port. At about 09:32 UT {{on the day of}} docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E
25|$|Current {{variants}} of the DSG will still downshift {{to the lowest}} possible gear ratio when the kick-down button is activated during full throttle whilst in <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> In <b>Manual</b> <b>mode</b> this kick-down is only activated by an additional button {{at the bottom of}} the accelerator pedal travel; unless this is pressed the DSG will not downshift, and will simply perform a full-throttle acceleration in whatever gear was previously being utilised.|$|E
5000|$|Program, Shutter priority, Aperture Priority {{and full}} <b>manual</b> <b>modes</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A version used in Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. It {{includes}} 3 <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Full {{support for}} Nikkor AF-S and G {{designated}} lenses (the F4 could not use G lenses in aperture-priority or full <b>manual</b> <b>modes).</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{investigation}} of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator boost control, so that the shift to <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying nose down pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the aircraft's flight manual, but did not require any design changes.|$|E
25|$|These {{operate in}} an {{identical}} manner as the floor mounted shift lever {{when it is}} placed across the gate in <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep {{both hands on the}} steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for <b>manual</b> <b>mode,</b> with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|E
50|$|The FG can be {{used with}} any {{dedicated}} Nikon speedlights (flashes) which support TTL flash exposure, and any non-dedicated flash units in either automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
50|$|SL 63 AMG {{includes}} AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission, {{which included}} 'C' (Comfort), 'S' (Sport), 'S+' (Sport plus) and 'M' (<b>Manual)</b> <b>modes,</b> AMG DRIVE UNIT, Race Start launch control.|$|R
25|$|The SLR uses AMG SPEEDSHIFT R {{five-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} with three <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b> For durability Mercedes selected a five-speed transmission {{rather than their}} seven-speed gearbox which was more complex and used more parts.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> and regaining elevator control.|$|E
25|$|In November 2006, Suzuki reintroduced the Cervo name. The modern, Alto-based Cervo {{is still}} a kei car but is much more luxurious than its predecessor. The Cervo {{originally}} came equipped with the 658cc K6A engine (54hp in the normally aspirated VVT G version, 60hp in the turbo T and TX version). It is only available as a five-door with a four-speed automatic (with a <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> in the turbo cars), and is marketed as a more masculine alternative to the MR Wagon. The nicer grade Cervos came with keyless entry and Bluetooth. In June 2007 a G Limited normally aspirated model was added, with the fourteen-inch alloys and rear spoiler of the TX.|$|E
25|$|Automatic Train Operation {{controls}} trains so that, between stations, {{they will}} move {{at the speed}} specified by the automatic train protection and automatic train supervision sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can control whether the train operates in automatic mode or <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional stopping distance, which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The automatic train protection system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{features}} of version 2.0 and 2.1.1 include app permissions, Waves MaxxAudio, SwiftKey keyboard, off-screen gestures, custom icons, dark <b>mode,</b> <b>manual</b> camera <b>mode,</b> and RAW support for 3rd party apps, like Camera FV-5 2.75.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Manual</b> shift <b>mode</b> ("Steptronic") {{added to}} {{automatic}} transmissions ...|$|R
50|$|The camera offers fully {{automatic}} exposure ("program") mode when {{coupled with an}} appropriate Pentax-A series lens. With such a lens the camera also offers shutter-priority mode, and with any compatible lens (i.e. Pentax-M lenses {{in addition to the}} Pentax-A series) the camera offers aperture-priority and fully <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted <b>Manual</b> <b>mode,</b> which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E
500|$|Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, {{the revised}} LS 460 and LS 460 L {{included}} restyled {{front and rear}} fascias, side mirror turn signals, and new wheel designs. New technology included automatic high beam lights and a self-repairing clear coat for the exterior paint. The standard cabin received additional chrome trim, an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest, and in certain markets, an all-digital instrument panel with night vision capability. The LS 460 Sport—a performance variant equipped with a sport-tuned air suspension, Brembo brakes, forged wheels, paddle shifters, body kit, and a unique interior—was added. The Sport model received the Sport Direct Shift transmission, {{also found in the}} Lexus IS F, with downshift rev-matching capability and <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> A new interior customization program, [...] "L-Select", also became available for LS customers in Japan.|$|E
500|$|After a {{long series}} of delays, Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the {{countdown}} due to equipment malfunctions, improvements to equipment functioning properly and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would burn up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion {{on how to deal with}} this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the solid-fueled retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the retrorocket pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, which Glenn thought it might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, [...] "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldn't be answering these questions." [...] After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but rather that the sensor was faulty.|$|E

500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, <b>manual</b> <b>mode</b> did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, [...] "control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side".|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese Exposed Section {{cargo carrier}} was berthed in Endeavour’s payload bay by the shuttle's robotic arm {{after it was}} handed the pallet by the station's robotic arm.

2500|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in <b>manual</b> <b>mode,</b> and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode.|$|E
50|$|The G-III {{features}} a 40 mm 1.7 with six elements in four groups. The integrated lightmeter provides shutter priority and <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b> The sensor {{is located on}} the forward part of the lens, which allows use of filters without manual compensation of exposure. The Canonet can use standard flashes, or the Canonlite D which was custom-designed for the Canonet.|$|R

5000|$|The shutter, a {{vertically}} traveling, electronically controlled metal blade unit, {{can be set}} for speeds between 30 and 1/4000 seconds, with an X-sync {{speed of}} 1/200 second. A [...] "Bulb" [...] mode is also available, for exposure {{as long as the}} shutter button is depressed. The speed is continuously variable in Program and aperture-priority modes, and can be set in half-stop increments in shutter-priority and <b>manual</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{choice of}} {{transmissions}} were offered. A ZF Friedrichshafen-sourced four-speed 4HP24A automatic transmission with a torque converter was available throughout the V8 production run. Automatic transmission has three modes: [...] "S" [...] – Sport; [...] "E" [...] – Economic and [...] "M" [...] – Manual operation. Sport mode is changing gears at higher rpm than Economic; <b>Manual</b> <b>mode</b> allows driver to choose gears using the lever. There were also two manual transmission offerings – for the 3.6: a five-speed manual gearbox, or later for the 4.2, a six-speed manual. Both manual transmission variants used a [...] single-plate clutch.|$|E
2500|$|The sky {{was dark}} and the pilots lacked any visual ground references. Descent was {{controlled}} {{through the use of}} the vertical-speed wheel of the autopilot, combined with an altitude preselect (which illuminated a light when reaching preselected altitudes) in <b>manual</b> <b>mode.</b> While retaining use of the autopilot, the pilots reduced their speed to [...] at the request of air-traffic control at 19:07. At this point the pilots were working through the approach checklist. The captain halted the checklist at the point regarding the radio altimeter, as the aircraft was above its operational limit, and he wanted to control the plane's operation during further descent. At 19:11, the aircraft received permission to bear 180 degrees and descend to and maintain 1,000 meters (3,000ft) of altitude. Both navigational receivers were tuned to the ILS frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a <b>MANUAL</b> <b>mode,</b> two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} market, DPReview {{considers}} the E-PL1 more {{aimed at the}} point-and-shoot (compact camera) market, rather than the DSLR market (like the E-P1 & E-P2) - it {{is more of a}} large-sensor compact than a small format DSLR. The E-PL1 is easy to use in automatic mode, but due to the small number of dedicated dials and buttons, it can be more awkward to use in <b>manual</b> <b>modes</b> compared to a DSLR.|$|R
