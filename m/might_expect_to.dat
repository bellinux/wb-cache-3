25|$|The name {{industrial}} and organizational psychology (I–O) {{arose in the}} 1960s and became enshrined as the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973. The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I–O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. I–O psychology's other subfield, organizational psychology, examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity. The majority of I–O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultants. A psychology consultant working in business today <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> provide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, {{and the organization of}} their company.|$|E

As far as we know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius."

On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E

This had led to a situation where workers who could not count on a Western-style meritocracy (where they <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find their pay and conditions improve with promotions) would instead have to rely on the decisions of managers to give bonuses and overtime payments if they wanted to increase their wages.

On July 1, 1731, Franklin and a number of his fellow members among the Junto drew up articles of agreement to found a library, for they had discovered that their far-ranging conversations on intellectual and political themes floundered at times on a point of fact that might be found in a decent library. In colonial Pennsylvania at the time there were not many books; Books from London booksellers were expensive to purchase and slow to arrive. Franklin and his friends were mostly of moderate means, and none alone could have afforded a representative library such as a gentleman of leisure <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> assemble.

2500|$|A gladiator <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> {{fight in}} two or three munera annually, and an unknown number would have died in their first match. Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an {{extraordinary}} 150 bouts; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement. A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively. George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality [...] "among all who entered the arena" [...] at 19/100. Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18–25 years of age. Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because missio was granted less often. Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.|$|E
2500|$|Mosaics were {{initially}} made with rounded pebbles, and later glass with tesserae which gave more colour and a flat surface. They were {{popular in the}} Hellenistic period, at first as decoration for the floors of palaces, but eventually for private homes. Often a central emblema picture in a central panel was completed in much finer work than the surrounding decoration. Xenia motifs, where a house showed examples {{of the variety of}} foods guests <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> enjoy, provide most of the surviving specimens of Greek still-life. [...] In general mosaic must be considered as a secondary medium copying painting, often very directly, as in the Alexander Mosaic. [...] The Unswept Floor by Sosus of Pergamon (c. 200 BC) was an original and famous trompe l'oeil piece, known from many Greco-Roman copies. According to John Boardman, Sosus is the only mosaic artist whose name has survived; his Doves are also mentioned in literature and copied. However, Katherine M. D. Dunbabin asserts that two different mosaic artists left their signatures on mosaics of Delos. The artist of the 4th-century BC Stag Hunt Mosaic perhaps also left his signature as Gnosis, although this word may be a reference to the abstract concept of knowledge.|$|E

In the writings of the alchemists we find the words misy, sory, chalcanthum applied to alum as well as to iron sulfate; and the name atramentum sutorium, which one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both.
