40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this area is to evaluate and understand the fire suppression behavior of a patented ultra-fine water mist technology with the tradename NanoMist™. NanoMist is a dense gas-like, ultra-fine (< 10 µm) water mist produced at ambient pressure. The mist exhibits superior ability to readily diffuse around obstructions and has a {{potential to be a}} total flooding agent. However, the technology needs research into key issues such as the mist deployment design, the transport behavior of mist within the flooding volume, the optimum conditions for the mist entrainment into the firebase, and the interaction of mist with laminar and turbulent fires. The specific {{objective of this}} work is to develop experimental design factors for testing NanoMist total flooding in a 27 -m 3 compartment using CFD simulations. The mist is deployed through multiple outlets located on the compartment floor. The number of outlets, their location are determined from the CFD results in order to produce the desired mist flux density. The mist spreads laterally across the compartment floor and rises to fill the compartment volume. The design factors including <b>mist</b> <b>outlet</b> locations, the outlet velocity, and the mist throughput were evaluated for extinction of a turbulent pool-like gas fire located at the center of floor...|$|E
