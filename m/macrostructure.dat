5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline <b>macrostructure.</b> It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E

5000|$|Blumer {{believed}} that {{society is not}} made up of <b>macrostructures,</b> but rather that the essence of society is found in microstructures, specifically in actors and their actions. These microstructures are not isolated, but consist of the collective action of combination, giving rise {{to the concept of}} joint action. Joint action is not just the sum of individual actions, but takes on a character of its own. Blumer did not reject the idea of <b>macrostructures,</b> but instead focused on the concept of emergence-our larger social structures emerge from the smaller. Blumer admitted that <b>macrostructures</b> are important, but that they have an extremely limited role in symbolic interactionism. Therefore, he argued that <b>macrostructures</b> are a little more than “frameworks” within which the really important aspects of social life (action and interaction) take place. Moreover, according to Blumer, <b>macrostructures</b> are important because they shape the situations in which individuals act and supply to actors a certain set of symbols that allow them to act. Also, he did not deny systems such as culture and social order. In sum, Blumer said that large scale structures are the frameworks for what is crucial in society, action and interaction. [...] He is not denying that social structures influence our actions, just that they do not determine our actions.|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} concerns {{synthesis of}} structured molecular sieves. The preparation procedure {{is based on}} the use of ion exchange resins as macrotemplates. Macroporous cation or anion exchange resin types were used depending on the molecular sieve type to be synthesized. Anion exchange resin beads were employed as macrotemplates in the synthesis of zeolite type molecular sieves since negatively charged precursor species are present in the initial zeolite synthesis solutions. Cation exchange resins were used for the preparation of aluminophosphate molecular sieves, where precursor species in the synthesis solutions are positively charged. The method involves a number of steps, which can be summarized as: (i) introduction of precursor species into the resin by ion exchange; (ii) secondary treatment to transform the precursor into a desired phase; and (iii) removal of the ion exchanger by calcination. The first two steps can be performed simultaneously by hydrothermally treating the resin with synthesis solution, where inorganic material is initially ion exchanged into the resin and transformed into a zeolite upon hydrothermal treatment. The steps (i) and (ii) may also be separated by firstly treating the resins with precursor solutions and then converting the exchanged species into a molecular sieve by secondary treatment with additional components and/or structure directing agents. Upon calcination the ion exchange resin and zeolite structure directing agents are removed leaving porous molecular sieve structures with a shape determined by the shape of the resin macrotemplate. The calcined <b>macrostructures</b> can be employed in secondary synthesis for the preparation of composite <b>macrostructures</b> containing two types of molecular sieves. Modified molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> were also prepared by the method. These <b>macrostructures</b> correspond to molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> containing various transition metal oxides. The modification is performed as a post-synthesis procedure. It {{is based on the}} fact that as synthesized resin-molecular sieve composites retain a certain degree of ion exchange capacity, which facilitates the introduction of charged metal ions. The procedure was demonstrated for both: (i) metal cations, which were exchanged into the cation exchange resin-molecular sieve composite; and (ii) negatively charged metal species, which were exchanged into anion exchange resin-molecular sieve composites. Upon calcination of a complex metal precursor-resin-molecular sieve composite modified molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> were obtained. The properties of non-modified and modified molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> were extensively characterized by various methods (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman and UV-vis DRS spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen adsorption and chemisorption measurements) to study the crystallization mechanism, sample crystallinity and morphology, nature of the metal species, etc. The non-modified molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> are of interest for application as catalysts and catalyst supports, adsorbents and packing materials, whereas modified <b>macrostructures</b> are of interest mainly in the area of catalysis.

40|$|Abstract. Superpositions of {{periodic}} dot screens {{are largely}} used in electronic imaging {{in the field}} of color printing. In such superpositions the interaction between the superposed layers may cause new structures to appear which did not exist in any of the original layers: <b>macrostructures</b> (also known as moiré patterns) and microstructures (also known as rosettes). While <b>macrostructures</b> are not always generated in the superposition (cf. moiré-free superpositions), microstructures exist practically in any superposition, except for the most trivial cases. In fact, even the <b>macrostructures,</b> whenever they occur, consist of variations in the microstructure of the superposition. In the present paper we investigate the microstructures that appear in the superposition of periodic structures and their properties. We also find the conditions on the superposed layers under which the microstructure of the superposition varies—or remains invariant—when individual layers in the superposition are laterally shifted with respect to each other. © 2002 SPIE and IS&T.

This thesis {{is dedicated to the}} {{preparation of}} metal containing molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> (modified <b>macrostructures).</b> Modified molecular sieve <b>macrostructures</b> were prepared by the resin templating method. Firstly, molecular sieves were synthesized within the pore structure of macroporous anion exchange resin beads. After this step, a certain degree of ion exchange capacity is retained by the resin facilitating the secondary insertion of metal anions. Metal anionic species were ion exchanged into the resin-molecular sieve composites obtained in a following step. Finally, the resin was removed by calcination leaving behind self-bonded metal containing molecular sieve spheres with a shape and size similar to the original resin beads. V, W, Cr and Pd containing <b>macrostructures</b> were prepared by the method. Resin-silica composites, in which the structure of the silica was changed from amorphous to crystalline silicalite- 1 were used for the preparation of the V and W spheres. The Cr and Pd containing spheres were prepared from resin-zeolite beta composites. The properties of the product spheres (metal content, crystallinity, morphology, nature of the metal species, etc.) were extensively characterized by atomic adsorption spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive, Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption and chemisorption measurements.

The flame shape in the combustor is highly related to the combustion stability {{and the performance of}} the gas turbine. In the current paper, the effects of confinement on the time averaged flame structures or flame <b>macrostructures</b> are studied experimentally. Experiments are carried out with swirl number S = 0. 66 in two cylindrical confinements with diameters of d 1 = 39 mm and d 2 = 64 mm and confinement ratio c 1 = 0. 148 and c 2 = 0. 0567. All the experiments were carried out in atmospheric. CH∗ chemiluminescence from the flame was recorded to visualize the flame behavior. An inverse Abel image reconstruction method was employed to better distinguish the flame <b>macrostructures.</b> Different mechanisms forming the time averaged M shape flames are proposed and analyzed. It is found that the confinement wall {{plays an important role in}} determining the flame <b>macrostructures.</b> The flow structures including the inner and outer recirculation zones formed in the confinement are revealed to be the main reasons that affects different flame <b>macrostructures.</b> Meanwhile, the alternation of flame shapes determines the flame stability characteristics. A smaller confinement diameter forced the flame front to bend upstream into the outer recirculation zone hence forming a M shape flame. A strong noise caused by the interaction of the flame front in the outer recirculation zone with the combustor wall was observed. Another unsteady behavior of the flame in the bigger combustor, which was caused by the alternation of the flame root position inside and outside the premixing tube, is also presented. The V shape flame in the two combustors radiated weaker chemiluminescence but the main heat release zone was elongated than the M shape flame. Other operating conditions, i. e. total mass flow rate of the air flow and the equivalence ratio also affect the flame <b>macrostructures.</b> The flame blowout limits were also altered under different test conditions. The bigger confinement has better performance in stabilizing the flame by having lower lean blowout limits...|$|R
