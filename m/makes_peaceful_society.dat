50|$|Mangyans {{lived in}} <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> as {{compared}} to the head hunting tribes of North Luzon and the brave defiant warrior tribes of the South. Social scientists theorized that some <b>societies</b> become <b>peaceful</b> because their system of norms and values reward peaceful behavior but disapprove aggressive and impulsive behaviors. <b>Peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> are characterized by egalitarian social organization without status competition between men and without asymmetric relationship between men and women. Another theory posited that populations adapt, therefore, offering a more logical explanation why Mangyans preferred to retreat in the hinterlands. They accept peaceful submissiveness when they encounter lowland settlers, missionaries, traders and government officials.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exploratory {{look at how}} the leadership practices of business organizations may foster more <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies.</b> I develop the logic for positive relationships between participative organizational leadership, employee empowerment, and peace. I offer several mechanisms to explain why these different manifestations of voice are likely to contribute to <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies.</b> I then draw on several cross-national databases to provide a preliminary examination of the hypotheses. I find support for the hypotheses regarding the positive effects of participative leadership and employee empowerment in work organizations on peace. The paper concludes by discussing contributions of this research to the organizational studies literature and offers directions for future research. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A society {{consisting}} of agents who can freely choose to attack {{or not to}} attack others inevitably evolves into a battling society (a ẃar of all against all) ́. We investigated whether strategies based on C. Schmittś concept of the political, the distinction of a friend and an enemy, lead to the emergence and collapse of social order. Especially, we propose f́riend selection strategies(́FSSs), one of which we called the ús-TFT(́tit for tat) strategy, which requires an agent to regard one who did not attack him or his f́riendsás a f́riend. ́ We carried out evolutionary simulations on an artificial society {{consisting of}} FSS agents.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine what upper {{secondary}} school students think that they themselves and their school can do to create a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society.</b> The study combine qualitative and quantitative methods based on questionnaires distributed among 328 students in three high schools in Sweden. The survey is a combination of multiple choice and open questions. For the analysis of quantitative responses the computer program SPSS was used producing frequency tables and response rate schemes. To analyze the questionnaire's qualitative part a narrative analysis method was used. The central theoretical framework {{of the study is}} research on peace, positive peace, peace education and racism. The conclusion of the study is that most students in the survey believe that the school {{plays an important role in}} establishing and supporting peaceful values, both with the students and in society at large. Students feel that school should take on more responsibility as a peacemaking force than it does today. They also expressed that the schools need to work more with anti-racism, harassment and bullying and that they think that the teachers ought to get more training in these subjects. According to the students, their most important role as individuals is to act in a way that promotes a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> while also living by what they preach.   They underlined the importance that each individual must take upon themselves to play an active role in promoting a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> and they also stressed the importance of working together to bring these changes. ...|$|R
