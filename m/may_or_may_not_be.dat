5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{is defined as}} damage to the brain {{resulting}} from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile.

The NLL plays four 15-minute quarters rather than three periods. If the game is tied at the end of regulation play, a 5-minute overtime (15 in NLL) can be played.

5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli which <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what {{activities}} should be undertaken by a company. Strategic greening {{in one area}} <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> leveraged effectively in others. A firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader. So although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless strategic in the product area.|$|E

The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, that <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest {{that it has a}} sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{an indication that the}} progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E

5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence that <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland in Iowa {{is perhaps}} best known for effigy mounds, large, low mounds shaped like animals such as birds and bears. Effigy mounds are {{distributed}} across southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northeast Iowa. A large concentration of mounds in several groups is preserved at Effigy Mounds National Monument. Like most mounds in Iowa, excavation reveals that these mounds were commonly used as sacred burial locations but contain few artifacts. Recent ground-penetrating radar survey of selected mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument reveal that many are badly disturbed, but others appear to be comparatively intact. The Folkert Mound Group in central Iowa contains an enigmatic cruciform mound that <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> astronomically aligned.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, which <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
