5000|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>rotor</b> {{shape is}} a {{cylinder}} {{mounted on a}} shaft. Internally it contains longitudinal conductive bars (usually made of aluminium or copper) set into grooves and connected at both ends by shorting rings forming a cage-like shape. The name {{is derived from the}} similarity between this rings-and-bars winding and a squirrel cage.|$|E
50|$|MIEV motors are {{constructed}} using an in-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>rotor,</b> an in-wheel motor stator, a rotor bracket, stator bracket and inverter directly behind the brakes. The batteries can be charged from a standard 15 A/200 V car charger in seven hours and with a three-phase electric power charged in 25 minutes (for up to 80 percent of full capacity). The batteries are located under the floorpan and in the Colt uses 22 Li-ion modules to produce a cumulative 325 V. The design allows for an entirely electric vehicle, or a hybrid using the batteries to supplement a traditional internal combustion engine or a hydrogen fuel cell.|$|E
5000|$|In both {{induction}} and synchronous motors, the AC {{power supplied}} to the motor's stator creates {{a magnetic field}} that rotates in synchronism with the AC oscillations. Whereas a synchronous <b>motor's</b> <b>rotor</b> turns {{at the same rate}} as the stator field, an induction <b>motor's</b> <b>rotor</b> rotates at a somewhat slower speed than the stator field. The induction motor stator's magnetic field is therefore changing or rotating relative to the rotor. This induces an opposing current in the induction <b>motor's</b> <b>rotor,</b> in effect the motor's secondary winding, when the latter is short-circuited or closed through an external impedance. [...] The rotating magnetic flux induces currents in the windings of the rotor; [...] in a manner similar to currents induced in a transformer's secondary winding(s).|$|R
50|$|Induction (asynchronous) <b>motor,</b> the <b>rotor</b> {{magnetic}} field {{is created by}} an induced current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator {{magnetic field}} to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction <b>motor</b> <b>rotors,</b> which are squirrel-cage rotor, wound rotor and solid core rotor.|$|R
50|$|In wound <b>rotor</b> <b>motors,</b> <b>rotor</b> circuit {{connection}} through slip rings to external resistances allows change of speed-torque characteristics for acceleration control and speed control purposes.|$|R
50|$|Circulator pumps {{as used in}} {{hydronic}} {{systems are}} usually electrically powered centrifugal pumps. As used in homes, they are often small, sealed, and rated {{at a fraction of}} a horsepower, but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the electric motor is usually separated from the pump body by some form of mechanical coupling. The sealed units used in home applications often have the <b>motor</b> <b>rotor,</b> pump impeller, and support bearings combined and sealed within the water circuit. This avoids one of the principal challenges faced by the larger, two-part pumps: maintaining a water-tight seal {{at the point where the}} pump drive shaft enters the pump body.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{rotating}} electrical machines, high rotation speeds and small clearances are utilised to maximise flux variations. This necessitates that close {{attention is paid}} to the quality of bearings utilised and the stiffness and accuracy of rotor. Drive for the alternator is normally provided by a standard induction motor for convention and simplicity. Both vertical and horizontal configurations are utilised and in most cases the <b>motor</b> <b>rotor</b> and generator rotor are mounted on a common shaft with no coupling. The whole assembly is then mounted in a frame containing the motor stator and generator stator. The whole construction is mounted in a cubicle which features a heat exchanger and water cooling systems as required.|$|E

50|$|An {{induction}} motor, 3 phase {{induction motor}} or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor {{in which the}} electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.
