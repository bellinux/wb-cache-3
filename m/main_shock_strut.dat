It has been a simple and rugged aircraft capable also of operating under arduous conditions and very easy and simple maintenance. The architecture of this airplane, which has operated actively for more than 20 years, is very interesting analyzing {{the implementation of a}} new propulsion system because of the unusual incorporation of two engines, as well as the two <b>main</b> landing gear <b>shock</b> <b>struts</b> of the faired main landing gear attached to short pylons {{on either side of the}} forward fuselage.

It then produces an effective design of the ACHEON nozzle for such an aircraft, the definition of the optimal positioning for stability and efficiency. In conclusion, it analyses the expected performances of the resulting aircraft architecture.

40|$|Depending on the {{different}} sink speeds, angles of attack and masses; aircraft landing gears could face {{a wide range of}} impact conditions which may possibly cause structural damage or failure. Thus, in hard landing scenarios, the landing gear must absorb sufficient energy in order to minimize dynamic stress on the aircraft airframe. Semi-active control systems are the recent potential solutions to overcome these limitations. Among semi-active control strategies, those based on smart fluids such as magneto-rheological (MR) fluids have received recent attraction as their rheological properties can be continuously controlled using magnetic or electric field and they are not sensitive to the contaminants and the temperature variation and also require lower powers. This thesis focuses on modeling of a MR damper for landing gear system and analysis of semi-active controller to attenuate dynamic load and landing impact. First, passive landing gear of a Navy aircraft is modeled and the forces associated with the <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> are formulated. The passive <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> is then integrated with a MR valve to design MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut.</b> Here, MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> is integrated with the landing gear system modeled as the 2 DOF system and governing equations of motion are derived in order to simulate the dynamics of the system under different impact conditions. Subsequently the inverse model of the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> relating MR yield stress to the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> force and strut velocity is formulated. Using the developed governing equations and inverse model, a PID controller is formulated to reduce the acceleration of the system. Controlled performance of the simulated MR landing gear system is demonstrated and compared with that of passive syste...|$|R
40|$|Equations {{describing}} the friction forces generated during landing operations on ships at sea were formulated. These forces {{depend on the}} platform reaction and the coefficient of friction. The platform reaction depends on the relative sink rate and the shock absorbing capability of the landing gear. The friction coefficient varies with the surface condition of the landing platform and the angle of yaw of the aircraft relative to the landing platform. Landings by VTOL aircraft, equipped with conventional oleopneumatic landing gears are discussed. Simplifications are introduced to reduce {{the complexity of the}} mathematical description of the tire and <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> characteristics. Approximating the actual complicated force deflection characteristic of the tire by linear relationship is adequate. The internal friction forces in the <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> are included in the landing gear model.

40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of excitation conditions with conflicting damping requirements. A novel solution to this problem is to implement semi-active damping using magnetorheological (MR) fluids. In part 1 of this contribution, a methodology was developed that enables the geometry of a flow mode MR valve to be optimized within the constraints of an existing passive landing gear. The device was designed to be optimal in terms of its impact performance, which was demonstrated using numerical simulations of the complete landing gear system. To perform the simulations, assumptions were made regarding some of the parameters used in the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> model. In particular, the MR fluid's yield stress, viscosity, and bulk modulus properties were not known accurately. Therefore, the present contribution aims to validate these parameters experimentally, via the manufacture and testing of an MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut.</b> The gas exponent, which is used to model the <b>shock</b> <b>strut's</b> nonlinear stiffness, is also investigated. In general, it is shown that MR fluid property data at high shear rates are required in order to accurately predict performance prior to device manufacture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the potential of the time-to-failure method as a tool for intermediate-term earthquake prediction. The investigation in this thesis consisted of validating the accelerated energy release phenomenon, which is utilized in the time-to-failure method, and providing empirical and theoretical bases for the determination of two of the four unknown parameters. The empirical relationships constraining the two parameters, the coefficient k/m and exponent m in the modified time-to-failure equation, were identified by using the actual values of the modeled <b>main</b> <b>shocks</b> in a retrospective prediction of the <b>main</b> <b>shock.</b> The modeled <b>main</b> <b>shocks</b> that were used in this investigation are from three different catalogs, the New Madrid Seismic Zone, western United States, and southern California. The remaining two unknown parameters are the time-of-failure and the magnitude of the <b>main</b> <b>shock.</b> The predicted values are determined by constructing a prediction contour diagram. The modified time-to-failure method does not work when two <b>main</b> <b>shocks</b> occur near each other in both space and time (interfering events), or if the earthquake catalog, from which the precursory events are selected, is not complete for the minimum size precursory event (magnitudes larger than about 2. 5 units smaller than the <b>main</b> <b>shock).</b> ^ The modified time-to-failure equation is utilized in a <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> search location technique which is a method for identifying the location of an impending <b>main</b> <b>shock.</b> A systematic search of a particular region for a future <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> is conducted at defined grid points. The technique identifies and records acceleration sequence and search radius information associated with a given search magnitude for each grid point. The acceleration search radius data are used to calculate a Normalized Search Radius (NSR) range for each grid point. The NSR data are contoured, and local maximum of the NSR anomaly corresponds to the impending <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> location. ^ The investigation of the time-to-failure method resulted in the development of a modified intermediate-term earthquake prediction method that provides the predicted time, size, and location of a future <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> using precursory earthquakes available from present earthquake catalogs. The error estimates associated with each predicted value allow for an objective determination of the success or failure of the prediction. The entire research project (using all three earthquake catalogs) consisted of evaluating 60 separate main events, 26 of the events could be modeled by the modified time-to-failure method. The 34 <b>main</b> <b>shocks</b> that could not be modeled either were located near interfering events, or the earthquake catalog was not complete for the minimum size precursory event. In addition, an analysis of the practical application of the method indicates that up to 33 % of the acceleration sequences may end with several small events instead of one <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> (a false-positive sequence). However, all <b>main</b> <b>shocks</b> that met the acceleration sequence criteria were observed to have accelerated energy releases that could be modeled by the modified time-to-failure method (no false-negatives were identified for <b>main</b> <b>shocks,</b> in any of the three earthquake catalogs, that met both acceleration sequence criteria). In retrospective predictions, errors in <b>main</b> <b>shock</b> magnitude are usually less than about 0. 5 magnitude units. Errors in the time-of-failure are usually less than about one year.

To account for this stress dependence of the duration and the presence of discontinuities, a model for foreshocks occurrence is presented.

Such constraints are vital in landing gear, if MR technology is to be considered as feasible in commercial applications. The design approach focuses on the impact or landing phase of an aircraft's flight, where large variations in sink speed, angle of attack and aircraft mass makes an MR device potentially very attractive.
