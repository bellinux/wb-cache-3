5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more <b>microstructural</b> observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} <b>microstructural</b> observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E

25|$|In the {{processing}} of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled flocculation of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to <b>microstructural</b> heterogeneities.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline {{minerals}} {{formed in}} the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g., strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit <b>microstructural</b> order over a range of scales. The minerals are crystallized from {{an environment that is}} undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0–40°C).|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} has grown tremendously in stature {{over the past}} few years and is now being widely employed in a wide variety of scientific fields such as fuel cell testing, biomolecular interaction, and <b>microstructural</b> characterization. Often, EIS reveals information about the reaction mechanism of an electrochemical process: different reaction steps will dominate at certain frequencies, and the frequency response shown by EIS can help identify the rate limiting step.|$|E
25|$|Replacement {{occurs when}} the shell, bone or other tissue is {{replaced}} with another mineral. In some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that <b>microstructural</b> features are preserved despite the total loss of original material. A shell {{is said to be}} recrystallized when the original skeletal compounds are still present but in a different crystal form, as from aragonite to calcite.|$|E
25|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown {{patients}} with Niemann-Pick, type C to have a corpus callosum with <b>microstructural</b> abnormalities. Clear reductions in corpus callosum mean thickness and surface area have been shown when compared to age-matched controls. Also, studies using diffusion tensor imaging have shown marked reductions in callosal fractional anisotropy, which suggests architectural abnormalities based on the directional flow of water. These conclusions suggest that the corpus callosum {{plays an important role}} in the disease and should be explored for use as a biomarker of disease progression.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} {{is found}} widely in biological systems {{and provides the}} basis {{of a wide variety of}} complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on <b>microstructural</b> features and designs found in nature. Thus, self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization.|$|E
25|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be the basic elements of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in <b>microstructural</b> evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} <b>microstructural</b> {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E
500|$|Fossilized {{eggs are}} {{classified}} in their own, parataxonomic system parallel to Linnaean taxonomy. Macroolithus and Elongatoolithus {{were the first}} oogenera ever named in this system; they were classified in the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. Cladistic analysis also supports the placement of [...] Macroolithus close to Elongatoolithus, together with other elongatoolithids in a clade. Four oospecies are known: M. rugustus, M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. The oogenus's microstructures are poorly-defined and therefore may be in need of revision. When Mikhailov described M. mutabilis, he found no <b>microstructural</b> difference in Zhao's original illustrations of M. rugustus and M. yaotunensis, but did not synonymize the oospecies because Chinese paleontologists considered them distinct.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of creep depends on temperature and stress. Under {{the conditions of}} different temperature and applied stress, dislocation glide, dislocation climb, or diffusional-flow mechanisms may dominate creep deformation. Some mechanisms of creep, especially those involving dislocations, have not been verified by direct <b>microstructural</b> examination yet. However, processes just like the mechanisms conjectured should happen during creep deformation.|$|E
2500|$|Skin is a {{soft tissue}} and {{exhibits}} key mechanical behaviors of these tissues. [...] The most pronounced {{feature is the}} J-curve stress strain response, in which a region of large strain and minimal stress exists, and corresponds to the <b>microstructural</b> straightening and reorientation of collagen fibrils. In some cases the intact skin is prestreched, like wetsuits around the diver's body, and in other cases the intact skin is under compression. Small circular holes punched on the skin may widen or close into ellipses, or shrink and remain circular, depending on preexisting stresses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amygdala}} and frontal {{areas have}} been suggested as particularly important. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced <b>microstructural</b> integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (such as the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested {{that the degree of}} abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors. Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have been associated with [...] "callous-unemotional" [...] traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be due to methodological issues.|$|E
2500|$|Dysfunctions in the {{prefrontal cortex}} and {{amygdala}} {{regions of the}} brain {{have been associated with}} specific learning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury, including damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled [...] "psychopathic individuals" [...] whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus-reinforced learning in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean <b>microstructural</b> integrity in their uncinate fasciculus—white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence from DT-MRI, of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas.|$|E

Image processing is a robust technique for determination of morphological {{features such as}} volume fraction, inclusion morphology, void and crystal orientations. To acquire micrographs, optical as well as electron microscopy are commonly used.
