An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the Statute of Frauds (by committing to a lease of more than — depending on the jurisdiction — one year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the [...] "default" [...] tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is a <b>month-to-month</b> <b>tenancy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Edwards v. Habib is {{a recent}} {{decision}} from the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, which allows tenants in <b>month-to-month</b> <b>tenancies</b> a defense against summary dispossess actions. Where the tenant had complained to local authorities that his dwelling {{did not meet the}} minimal housing standards in that jurisdiction, a landlord had been able to punish the complaining tenant through eviction. The tenant in the District of Columbia after Edwards is now permitted to assert as a defense to eviction the illegal retaliatory purpose of the landlord. The decision is an important judicial attempt to bring landlord-tenant law into conformity with the reality of a continuing domestic-housing shortage and the necessity to enforce municipal housing codes.
