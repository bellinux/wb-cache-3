40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the nervous system controls motor tasks using a low-dimensional modular organization of muscle activation. However, {{it is not clear}} if such an organization applies to coordination of human walking, nor how nervous system injury may alter the organization of <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> and their biomechanical outputs. We first tested the hypothesis that muscle activation patterns during walking are produced through the variable activation of a small set of <b>motor</b> <b>modules.</b> In 20 healthy control subjects, EMG signals from eight leg muscles were measured across a range of walking speeds. Four <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> identified through nonnegative matrix factorization were sufficient to account for variability of muscle activation from step to step and across speeds. Next, consistent with the clinical notion of abnormal limb flexion-extension synergies post-stroke, we tested the hypothesis that subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis would have altered <b>motor</b> <b>modules,</b> leading to impaired walking performance. In post-stroke subjects (n = 55), a less complex coordination pattern was shown. Fewer modules were needed to account for muscle activation during walking at preferred speed compared with controls. Fewer modules resulted from merging of the modules observed in healthy controls, suggesting reduced independence of neural control signals. The number of modules was correlated to preferred walking speed, speed modulation, step length asymmetry, and propulsive asymmetry. Our results suggest a common modular organization of muscle coordination underlying walking in both healthy and post-stroke subjects. Identification of <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> may lead to new insight into impaired locomotor coordination and the underlying neural systems...|$|R

In this study we evaluate whether an acute noxious stimulus induces {{a change in the}} way <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> are combined to generate movement by neck muscles. The neck region was selected as it is a region with potentially high muscular redundancy. We used the <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> framework to assess the redistribution of muscular activity of 12 muscles (6 per side) in the neck region of 8 healthy individuals engaged in a head and neck aiming task, in non-painful conditions (baseline, isotonic saline injection, post pain) and after the injection of hypertonic saline into the right splenius capitis muscle. The kinematics of the task was similar in the painful and control conditions. A general decrease of activity was noted for the injected muscle during the painful condition together with an increase or decrease of the activity of the other muscles. Subjects did not adopt shared control strategies (<b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> inter subject similarity at baseline 0. 73 ± 0. 14); the <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> recorded during the painful condition could not be used to reconstruct the activation patterns of the control conditions, and the painful stimulus triggered a subject-specific redistribution of muscular activation (i. e., in some subjects the activity of a given muscle increased, whereas in other subjects it decreased with pain).

40|$|Fault {{tolerant}} {{motor drives}} {{are becoming more}} important in safety critical applications. Although a single <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> fault tolerant drive may be sufficient in some applications, this motor drive only offers limited redundancy. This thesis investigated the dual <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> fault tolerant drive system in which two motor modules were connected electrically in phase and on a common shaft provide redundancy and to increase {{the reliability of the}} entire drive system. A general phase current mathematical model to produce the desired output torque was developed to minimize copper loss and torque ripple in the motor drive, which is applicable to both sinusoidal and trapezoidal brushless permanent magnet motor types. A detailed fault effect investigation was performed in this thesis and it is concluded that switch short-circuit fault is the most serious fault since it reduces the electromagnetic torque output significantly and generates larger torque ripple in the motor drive due to the presence of large drag torque. Three fault remedial strategies were proposed to compensate the torque loss and to reduce the torque ripple under different faulty conditions. It is concluded from the analytical results that fault remedial strategy 3 is the tradeoff algorithm in which the zero torque ripple factor can be achieved with only a modest increase in copper loss comparing with the minimum possible value. Two practical dual <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> fault tolerant brushless permanent magnet drive test arrangements with different motor structures were developed in this thesis. The computer simulation studies using the MATLAB Simulink were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault remedial strategies. The efficiency of the motor drive was predicted based on torque loss measurements and the results were verified in the simulation study. The effect of faults on the drive efficiency was investigated as well. The entire fault tolerant motor drive control system was also developed to verify the analytical and simulation results. A fault detection and identification method to detect switch open-circuit faults, switch short-circuit faults, and the winding short-circuit faults was also proposed. Its advantages are the simplicity of the implementation and reduction {{of the cost of the}} drive system. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed fault remedial strategies can be implemented in real time motor control and are effective to compensate the torque loss and reduce the torque ripple.

A Reichardt-based control scheme is compared with a conventional visual servoing approach. As a consequence of the specific velocity dependence of the Reichardt-model, the stability margin of the visual servo control is increased and high overall gains, thus, better performance are achievable. The response of the Reichardt-model in the experiment and the control performance of velocity control approach with the Reichardt-model in the closed loop are investigated. The velocity control model is tested on a 1 -DOF linear <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> with different feedback gain and different time delay in the loop.

This {{approach is a}} convenient concise representation of muscle activities as distributed in <b>motor</b> <b>modules,</b> activated in specific gait phases. For applying NMF, the EMG signals are analysed either as single trials, or as averaged EMG, or as concatenated EMG (data structure). The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the influence of the data structure on the extracted <b>motor</b> <b>modules.</b> Twelve healthy men walked at their preferred speed on a treadmill while surface EMG signals were recorded for 60 s from 10 lower limb muscles. <b>Motor</b> <b>modules</b> representing relative weightings of synergistic muscle activations were extracted by NMF from 40 step cycles separately (EMGSNG), from averaging 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 40 consecutive cycles (EMGAVR), and from the concatenation of the same sets of consecutive cycles (EMGCNC). Five <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> were sufficient to reconstruct the original EMG datasets (reconstruction quality > 90 %), regardless of the type of data structure used. However, EMGCNC was associated with a slightly reduced reconstruction quality with respect to EMGAVR. Most <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> were similar when extracted from different data structures (similarity > 0. 85). However, the quality of the reconstructed 40 -step EMGCNC datasets when using the muscle weightings from EMGAVR was low (reconstruction quality ~ 40 %). On the other hand, the use of weightings from EMGCNC for reconstructing this long period of locomotion provided higher quality, especially using 20 concatenated steps (reconstruction quality ~ 80 %). Although EMGSNG and EMGAVR showed a higher reconstruction quality for short signal intervals, these data structures did not account for step-to-step variability.

How <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> are underpinned by neural circuits has remained obscured. As a first step towards dissecting these circuits, we optogenetically evoked motor outputs from the lumbosacral spinal cord of two strains of transgenic mice – the Chat, with channelrhodopsin (ChR 2) expressed in motoneurons, and the Thy 1, expressed in putatively excitatory neurons. Motor output was represented as a spatial field of isometric ankle force. We found that Thy 1 force fields were more complex and diverse in structure than Chat fields: the Thy 1 fields comprised mostly non-parallel vectors while the Chat fields, mostly parallel vectors. In both, most fields elicited by co-stimulation of two laser beams were well explained by linear combination of the separately-evoked fields. We interpreted the Thy 1 force fields as representations of spinal <b>motor</b> <b>modules.</b> Our comparison of the Chat and Thy 1 fields allowed us to conclude, with reasonable certainty, that the structure of neuromotor modules originates from excitatory spinal interneurons.

One {{important aspect of the}} rehabilitation process is the improvement of muscle coordination patterns, which can be drastically altered after stroke.

The aim of our study was to find how muscle coordination, analyzed from the perspective of <b>motor</b> <b>modules,</b> could change during motor adaptation to a dynamic environment generated by a haptic interface. Methods: In our experiment we employed the traditional paradigm of exposure to a viscous force field to subjects that grasped the handle of an actuated joystick during a reaching movement (participants moved directly forward and back by 30 c m). EMG signals of ten muscles of the tested arm were recorded. We extracted <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> from the pooled EMG data of all subjects and analyzed the muscle coordination patterns.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} effort {{put in the}} development of robotic systems for neurorehabiltation, justified by the big potential of such applications as additional end efficient tools for therapy, their clinical effectiveness is still being discussed. Many of the systems developed to date were designed from an engineering point of view and do not meet therapy demands, which is reflected by unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. In order to improve these systems, new rehabilitation protocols need to be based upon a deeper knowledge of how motor control and muscle coordination are achieved on a neurological level, and of how they are affected by neurologic injury. In this research project, which is a combined effort between the Mechatronics group of the University of Padua and the Upper Extremity Motor Function Laboratory of the Medical University of South Carolina, we approached the study of muscle coordination by searching for fundamental coordination patters used to execute various movements and shared by different subjects. We recorded the EMG activity of 16 upper limb muscles of 15 healthy control subjects and 14 stroke patients during the execution {{of a wide variety of}} fast reaching movements. We then applied a non-negative factorization algorithm to the processed EMG envelopes and extracted <b>motor</b> <b>modules,</b> which represent the coordination strategies used by each subject. We found that a very limited set of <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> can explain the muscle activation patterns of all healthy control subjects, and that these coordination strategies are mostly shared between dominant and non-dominant side. Furthermore, most healthy participants seem to use similar coordination patterns, and we could associate each of the most commonly shared <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> with a corresponding biomechanical function. We also found that the effects of stroke can be seen both by looking at the number of modules and by analyzing their composition. In fact, stroke patients use significantly less modules both on their impaired and on their unimpaired side, and some of these modules can be explained as a combination of several merged modules found in healthy controls. These results suggest that motor impairment after stroke can be explained by a reduction in the set of <b>motor</b> <b>modules.</b> Together with the apparent inability to control certain modules independently, and which are therefore identified as merged, this could justify the limited movement complexity observed in stroke patients. We propose that new robotic rehabilitation protocols could use the information obtained by the extraction of <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> to assess the patient's motor impairment and to address his/her specific needs. In fact, the comparison of the patient's modules with those identified in healthy control subjects can give precious information on the nature of the patient's disabilities, and provide guidelines for the choice of motor functions that should be trained during therap...|$|R

Slight differences between treadmill (TRD) and overground running (OVG) kinematics and muscle activity have previously been reported. However, little is known about differences in the modular control of muscle activation in these two conditions. Therefore, we aimed at investigating differences between <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> extracted from TRD and OVG by factorization of multi-muscle electromyographic (EMG) signals. Twelve healthy men ran on a treadmill and overground at their preferred speed while we recorded tibial acceleration and surface EMG from 11 ipsilateral lower limb muscles. We extracted <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> representing relative weightings of synergistic muscle activations by non-negative matrix factorization from 20 consecutive gait cycles. Four <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> were sufficient to accurately reconstruct the EMG signals in both TRD and OVG (average reconstruction quality = 92 ?? 3 %). Furthermore, a good reconstruction quality (80 ?? 7 %) was obtained also when muscle weightings of one condition (either OVG or TRD) were used to reconstruct the EMG data from the other condition. The peak amplitudes of activation signals showed a similar timing (pattern) across conditions. The magnitude of peak activation for the module related to initial contact was significantly greater for OVG, whereas peak activation for modules related to leg swing and preparation to landing were greater for TRD. We conclude that TRD and OVG share similar muscle weightings throughout motion. In addition, modular control for TRD and OVG is achieved with minimal temporal adjustments, which were dependent on the phase of the running cycle...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automation is a {{necessity}} in modern society. People sometimes are inclined to trust automation too much. On the other hand, they sometimes tend to {{not be willing to}} use automation. To prevent these mistakes, this study explores factors of reaching an appropriate reliance on automation systems by using cognitive modeling. We have conducted psychological experiments on this problem using a simple line-tracing (driving) task where the participants had to track the line with a circle by pressing the arrow key on the keyboard (manual control) or rely on automation (auto control). They could switch between auto and manual control during the task. The success probabilities of each control mode were systematically varied. The ACT-R model that simulates these experiments was constructed by representing the reliance on the automation as utilities of rules. The model performs this task by firing rules that manage the perceptual/motor modules. The perceptual module finds and attends to the vehicle and the road on the screen, and the <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> press the keys depending on the current controlling modes or the current positional relation between the vehicle and the road. The utilities of these rules are updated based on the rewards in every screen update. This utility module is also compatible to a previous computational model of automation reliance.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which ion-flux through the membrane-bound <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> (F 0) induces rotational torque, driving {{the rotation of the}} gamma subunit, was probed with a Na+-translocating hybrid ATP synthase. The ATP-dependent occlusion of 1 (22) Na+ per ATP synthase persisted after modification of the c subunit ring with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), when 22 Na+ was added first and ATP second, but not if the order of addition was reversed. These results support the model of ATP-driven rotation of the c subunit oligomer (rotor) versus subunit a (stator) that stops when either a 22 Na+-loaded or a DCCD-modified rotor subunit reaches the Na+-impermeable stator. The ATP synthase with a Na+-permeable stator catalyzed 22 Na+out/Na+in-exchange after reconstitution into proteoliposomes, which was not significantly affected by DCCD modification of the c subunit oligomer, but was abolished by the additional presence of ATP or by a membrane potential (DeltaPsi) of 90 mV. We propose that in the idling mode of the motor, Na+ ions are shuttled across the membrane by limited back and forth movements of the rotor against the stator. This motional flexibility is arrested if either ATP or DeltaPsi induces the switch from idling into a directed rotation. The Propionigenium modestum ATP synthase catalyzed ATP formation with DeltaPsi of 60 - 125 mV but not with DeltapNa+ of 195 mV. These results demonstrate that electric forces are essential for ATP synthesis and lead to a new concept of rotary-torque generation in the ATP synthase motor...|$|E
40|$|Switching of {{bacterial}} flagellar rotation {{is caused by}} large domain movements of the FliG protein triggered by binding of the signal protein CheY to FliM. FliG and FliM form adjacent multi-subunit arrays within the basal body C-ring. The movements alter {{the interaction of the}} FliG C-terminal (FliGC) "torque" helix with the stator complexes. Atomic models based on the Salmonella entrovar C-ring electron microscopy reconstruction have implications for switching, but lack consensus on the relative locations of the FliG armadillo (ARM) domains (amino-terminal (FliGN), middle (FliGM) and FliGC) as well as changes during chemotaxis. The generality of the Salmonella model is challenged by the variation in motor morphology and response between species. We studied coevolved residue mutations to determine the unifying elements of switch architecture. Residue interactions, measured by their coevolution, were formalized as a network, guided by structural data. Our measurements reveal a common design with dedicated switch and motor modules. The FliM middle domain (FliMM) has extensive connectivity most simply explained by conserved intra and inter-subunit contacts. In contrast, FliG has patchy, complex architecture. Conserved structural motifs form interacting nodes in the coevolution network that wire FliMM to the FliGC C-terminal, four-helix <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> (C 3 - 6). FliG C 3 - 6 coevolution is organized around the torque helix, differently from other ARM domains. The nodes form separated, surface-proximal patches that are targeted by deleterious mutations as in other allosteric systems.

The node interacts with nodes in the N-terminal FliGc α-helix triad (ARM-C) and FliGN.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the modular control {{of changes in}} direction while running is influenced by perturbations to balance. Twenty-two healthy men performed 90 ° side-step unperturbed cutting manoeuvres while running (UPT) as well as manoeuvres perturbed at initial contact (PTB, 10 cm translation of a moveable force platform). Surface EMG activity from 16 muscles of the supporting limb and trunk, kinematics, and ground reaction forces were recorded. Motor modules composed by muscle weightings and their respective activation signals were extracted from the EMG signals by non-negative matrix factorization. Knee joint moments, co-contraction ratios and co-contraction indexes (hamstrings/quadriceps) and motor modules were compared between UPT and PTB. Five motor modules were enough to reconstruct UPT and PTB EMG activity (variance accounted for UPT  =  92 ± 5 %, PTB =  90 ± 6 %). Moreover, higher similarities between muscle weightings from UPT and PTB (similarity =  0. 83 ± 0. 08) were observed {{in comparison to the}} similarities between the activation signals that drive the temporal properties of the motor modules (similarity =  0. 71 ± 0. 18). In addition, the reconstruction of PTB EMG from fixed muscle weightings from UPT resulted in higher reconstruction quality (82 ± 6 %) when compared to reconstruction of PTB EMG from fixed activation signals from UPT (59 ± 11 %). Perturbations at initial contact reduced knee abduction moments (7 %), as well as co-contraction ratio (11 %) and co-contraction index (12 %) shortly after the perturbation onset. These changes in co-contraction ratio and co-contraction index were caused by a reduced activation of hamstrings that was also verified in the activation signals of the specific <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> related to initial contact. Our results suggested that perturbations to balance influence modular control of cutting manoeuvres, especially the temporal properties of muscle recruitment, due to altered afferent inputs to the motor patterns. Furthermore, reduced knee stability during perturbed events may be related to overall control of lower limb muscles...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{prototype of}} a brachytherapy equipment has been constructed. The work started by developing conceptual design, followed by basic design and detailed design. In the conceptual design, design requirements are stated. In the basic design, technical specifications for main components are determined. In detailed design, general drawings are discussed. The prototype {{consists of three}} main systems: a mechanical system, an instrumentation system, and a safety system. The mechanical system assures the movement mechanism of the isotope source position beginning from the standby position until the applicators. It consists of three main modules: a position handling module, a container module, and a channel distribution module. The position handling module serves to move the isotope source position. As shielding, the second module is to store the source when the equipment is in standby position. The prototype provides 12 output channels. The channel selection is performed by the third module. The instrumentation system controls the movement of source position by handling motor operations. It consists of several modules. A microcontroller module serves as a control center whose task includes both controlling motors and communicating with computer. A <b>motor</b> <b>module</b> serves to handle motors. 10 sensors, including their signal conditionings, are introduced to read the environment conditions of the equipment. LEDs are used to display these conditions. In order to facilitate the operators 2 ̆ 7 duty, communication via RS 232 is provided. The brachytherapy equipment can therefore be operated by using computer. Interface software is developed using C# language. To complete both mechanical and instrumentation systems performance, a safety system is developed {{to make sure that}} the safety for operator and patients from receiving excessive radiation. An interlock system is introduced to guard against abnormal conditions. In the worst case, a manual intervention by the operator is provided when all other means are failing to store the isotope source into the safe container. The tests showed good results. The prototype can send the isotope source to applicators. The isotope source can be positioned with an accuracy of ± 0. 5 mm and with a speed of 550 mm/second. These characteristics meet the design criteria. Received: 16 January 2013; Revised: 26 August 2013; Accepted: 29 August 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{hypothesized}} that locomotion {{is achieved by}} means of rhythm generating networks (central pattern generators) and muscle activation generating networks. This modular organization can be partly identified from {{the analysis of the}} muscular activity by means of factorization algorithms. The activity of rhythm generating networks is described by activation signals whilst the muscle intervention generating network is represented by <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> (muscle synergies). In this study, we extend the analysis of modular organization of walking to the case of robot-aided locomotion, at varying speed and body weight support level.

40|$|The {{control of}} human {{movement}} {{is believed to}} be organized in sets of predefined muscular patterns usually referred to as <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> or muscle synergies.

40|$|The {{musculoskeletal}} redundancy of {{the body}} provides multiple solutions for performing motor tasks. We have proposed that the nervous system solves this unconstrained problem through the recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> or functional muscle synergies that map motor intention to action. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that trial-by-trial variations in muscle activation for multidirectional balance control in humans were constrained by a small set of muscle synergies. However, apparent muscle synergy structures could arise from characteristic patterns of sensory input resulting from perturbations or from low-dimensional optimal motor solutions. Here we studied electromyographic (EMG) responses for balance control {{across a range of}} biomechanical contexts, which alter not only the sensory inflow generated by postural perturbations, but also the muscle activation patterns used to restore balance. Support-surface translations in 12 directions were delivered to subjects standing in six different postural configurations: one-leg, narrow, wide, very wide, crouched, and normal stance. Muscle synergies were extracted from each condition using nonnegative matrix factorization. In addition, muscle synergies from the normal stance condition were used to reconstruct muscle activation patterns across all stance conditions. A consistent set of muscle synergies were recruited by each subject across conditions. When balance demands were extremely different from the normal stance (e. g., one-legged or crouched stance), task-specific muscle synergies were recruited in addition to the preexisting ones, rather generating de novo muscle synergies. Taken together, our results suggest that muscle synergies represent consistent <b>motor</b> <b>modules</b> that map intention to action, regardless of the biomechanical context of the task...|$|R
