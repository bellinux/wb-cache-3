2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E

Wagner, Jr. presented her with the Bronze Medallion, the city's highest civilian award. A month later she defeated Brough in straight sets to win her first U.S. National championship. [...] "Winning Wimbledon was wonderful," [...] she wrote, [...] "and it <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] But there is nothing quite like winning the championship of your own country." [...] In all she reached the finals of eight Grand Slam events in 1957, winning the Wimbledon and U.S. National singles titles, the Wimbledon and Australian doubles championships, and the U.S. mixed doubles crown, and finishing second in Australian singles, U.S. doubles, and Wimbledon mixed doubles.
