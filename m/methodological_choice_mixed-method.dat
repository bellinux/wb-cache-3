40|$|Systems {{engineering}} {{researchers are}} repeatedly {{faced with a}} series of choices related to what to study. But there is another important parallel consideration that involves decisions about how to perform a study. This paper focuses on the latter by exploring specific questions related to research methodology choices in systems engineering. These questions include: (1) why is methodology important in systems engineering? (2) {{what is the difference between}} methodology and method? (3) what <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> exist and which choices are better than others? (4) how do you connect theory, methodology and domain? We view <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> as a set of dilemmas that the researcher must reconcile and we discuss reasons for <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in systems engineering. We propose connections between theory, methodology and domain and provide implications for researchers given these discussions...|$|R

More precisely, as the study of the types of discourses implies different <b>methodological</b> <b>choices,</b> the means suggested by methodological models vary and have to be adapted by each researcher...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{fundamental}} challenges in ecology is to identify the signature of assembly mechanisms resulting from patterns of community composition. For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much {{attention has been paid}} to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for inferring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> preceding the statistical analysis – i. e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits – and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i. e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> depend on a common strategy used when studying similar biological models, or that the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{article focuses}} on the ways of {{organizing}} studies according to their <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in the Base Referencial de Artigos de Periódicos em Ciência da Informação (Reference Database of Journal articles in Information Science). We highlight how the organization of scientific production by the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in Information Science contributes to the identification of its production features and domain analysis. We studied research categories and proposed five classification criteria: research purposes, approaches, focus, techniques and type of analysis. The proposal of a corpus in Information Science is empirically applied, represented by 689 articles, 10 % of the production indexed in Base Referencial de Artigos de Periódicos em Ciência da Informação from 1972 to 2010. We adopt content analysis to interpret the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> of authors identified in the corpus. The results point out that exploratory studies are more predominant when considering the research purpose; regarding the research approach, bibliographic and documentary studies are more predominant; systematic observation, questionnaire and interview were {{the most widely used}} techniques; document analysis and content analysis are the most widely used types of analysis; the research focus of theoretical, historical and bibliometric studies are more predominant. We found that some studies use two <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> and explicit epistemological approaches, such as the studies following the positivist approach in the 1970 s, and those influenced by the phenomenological approach in the 1980 s, which increased the use of methods in qualitative research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyze the {{implications}} of four methodological approaches {{for the study of}} race relations in US society: postpositivism, structuralism, hermeneutics and antifoundationalism. After detailing these four, we turn to the familiar case of an undergraduate student who wishes to better understand race relations on his/her campus. By detailing the implications of the student researcher 2 ̆ 7 s <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in such a case, it will become clear how certain questions about race relations are permitted, for example, by postpositivism that are not permitted by antifoundationalism (and vice versa). At the same time, some forms of knowledge regarding race relations may be a central focus from a structuralist perspective but of only marginal interest for hermeneutics (and vice versa). In the course of research the investigator represents an active agent, making a number of <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> that ultimately determine the types of questions one can ask and the forms of knowledge that can be generated. Thus an informed and intentional researcher is one who both (1) understands (and consciously wrestles with) the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> available to him/her and who (2) interprets his/her findings within the limits of these choices. For those who study race in the US, these choices carry enormous consequences. They contribute to a highly contentious body of knowledge concerning the fundamental nature of race as a social category. Indeed, the true significance of race (declining or otherwise) is premised upon a long chain of seemingly innocuous <b>methodological</b> <b>choices...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Russia, ROSSTAT, the Statistical Agency of the Federation, {{monitors}} poverty {{based on}} the annual Household Budget Survey. Although the HBS collects very detailed information on household consumption, the information on other dimensions of well-being is very limited. This has restricted both the analyses that can be undertaken with HBS, and the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> {{for the construction of}} the welfare aggregate. Aware of these limitations, ROSSTAT revised the HBS questionnaire {{in the last quarter of}} 2005. In this paper, we use a multi-topic household survey, NOBUS, which collects a richer set of data on consumption and household characteristics, to illustrate two points. First, we show how household welfare and poverty can be measured with a survey specially designed for this purpose. Second, we investigate the impact of alternative <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> on poverty and inequality, such as accounting for the consumption of durables, housing, subsidies for privileged citizens and rural-urban differences in the cost of living. We compare different welfare aggregates – constructed to take into account the data limitations of HBS or the <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> currently endorsed by ROSSTAT – with a benchmark aggregate constructed according to the recommendations of renowned internationa...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} centred {{product development}} {{and more specifically}} how <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> in user requirements elicitation can enable the users to communicate their requirements to the product developers.

These choices include the choice of data collection method, the choice of participants, the choice of mediating object, and the choice of context. In order to explore how different <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> can work as enabler in user requirements elicitation two case studies, three comparative studies, and a survey have been carried out. The results show that all four <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> influence user requirements elicitation in terms of their enabling effect.

An important finding was that enabling the user also includes enabling the designer to understand the user and the use situation in order for the designer to interpret the users' requirements.

40|$|Multivoxel pattern {{analysis}} of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data is continuing to increase in popularity. Like all fMRI analyses, these analyses require extensive data processing and <b>methodological</b> <b>choices,</b> but the impact of these decisions on the final results is not always known. This study explores the impact of four <b>methodological</b> <b>choices</b> on analysis outcomes and introduces the technique of partitioning on random runs for characterizing temporal dependencies and evaluating partitioning methods. The analyses were performed on two fMRI data sets, which were repeatedly analyzed with support vector machines, varying the method of temporal compression, smoothing, voxel-wise detrending, and partitioning into training and testing sets. Smoothing sometimes slightly increased classification accuracy. Partitioning other than on the runs increased classification accuracy, and the random runs technique allowed us to attribute this improvement to the increased amount of training data, rather than to bias. The impact of the temporal compression and detrending methods varied so strongly with data set that general recommendations could not be drawn. These interactions suggest that, rather than searching for a universally superior set of <b>methodological</b> <b>choices,</b> researchers must carefully consider each choice in the context of each experiment.
