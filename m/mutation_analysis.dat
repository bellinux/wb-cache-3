Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E

These principles include estimating the fraction of tumor cells for SNVs and CNAs, performing clustering of SNVs from single- and multisample cases, and single-cell sequencing. The application of subclonal reconstruction methods is providing key insights into tumor evolution, identifying subclonal driver mutations, patterns of parallel evolution and differences in mutational signatures between cellular populations, and characterizing the mechanisms of therapy resistance, spread, and metastasis...|$|R

40|$|The DNA damage {{response}} {{is important for}} maintaining genomic integrity following introduction of double-strand breaks (DSB) since illegitimate or incorrect repair of a DSB could promote malignant transformation. Mismatch-repair (MMR) deficient tumour cell lines are acutely sensitive to thymidine treatment and fail to activate homologous recombination (HR) repair following a DSB (Mohindra et al., 2002). Therefore, it was hypothesised that loss of HR repair may occur as a downstream event in tumours already deficient in MMR. The primary aim {{was to determine whether}} there were somatic mutations in candidate HR genes that were associated with colorectal cancer development and to examine the phenotypic consequences of such <b>mutations.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the candidate HR genes, XRCC 2, XRCC 3 and Mus 81 in a random collection of primary colorectal cancers and in a specific MMR-deficient tumour population revealed no tumour-specific <b>mutations.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the MREI J, NBSI and Rad 5 O genes revealed a frameshift mutation in an intronic T 11 tract of MRE 11 that gave rise to alternative splicing of the gene. This mutation was present in > 85 % of MSI+ colorectal tumours suggesting that alteration of MRE 11 occurs at a high frequency in tumours already deficient in MMR. The phenotypic consequences of MRE 11 dysfunction were investigated by expressing splice variants of MRE 11 in MMR-proficient human cells. Cells expressing an MRE 11 variant with a compromised nuclease domain, failed to activate wild-type MRE 11 following DNA damage, were dramatically more sensitive to thymidine and failed to activate HR repair following thymidine treatment. The novel results obtained here suggest that a functional MRE 11 is essential for the HR repair-mediated rescue of DNA replication forks impaired by thymidine. Furthermore, it was speculated that a functional MRE 11 may be essential to resolve the recombinogenic substrate specifically produced by thymidine. Given that this DNA damage response pathway appears to be disrupted in > 85 % of MSI+ colorectal tumours, these finding have important implications for treatment strategies directed against this subset of tumours...|$|R

40|$|Multitasking or {{moonlighting}} is {{the capability}} of some proteins to execute two or more biochemical functions. Usually, moonlighting proteins are experimentally revealed by serendipity. For this reason, {{it would be helpful}} that Bioinformatics could predict this multifunctionality, especially because of the large amounts of sequences from genome projects. In the present work, we analyse and describe several approaches that use sequences, structures, interactomics and current bioinformatics algorithms and programs to try to overcome this problem. Among these approaches are: a) remote homology searches using Psi-Blast, b) detection of functional motifs and domains, c) analysis of data from protein-protein interaction databases (PPIs), d) match the query protein sequence to 3 D databases (i. e., algorithms as PISITE), e) <b>mutation</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> between amino acids by algorithms as MISTIC. Programs designed to identify functional motif/domains detect mainly the canonical function but usually fail in the detection of the moonlighting one, Pfam and ProDom being the best methods. Remote homology search by Psi-Blast combined with data from interactomics databases (PPIs) have the best performance. Structural information and <b>mutation</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> can help us to map the functional sites. <b>Mutation</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> can only be used in very specific situations âit requires the existence of multialigned family protein sequences - but can suggest how the evolutionary process of second function acquisition took place.

IDH 2 mutations are heterozygous; they alter a single arginine residue at position 140 or 172 and have distinct prognostic significance. The current detection methods of IDH 2 mutations are laborious and time consuming as they require DNA sequencing. Herein, we report a new allele-specific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) method to detect the IDH 2 <b>mutations.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of leukemic DNA samples from 120 AML patients enabled to identify IDH 2 mutations in 22 cases which were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.

The results concluded that both patients have low concentrations of HVA and HIAA and high concentrations of sepiapterin in the CSF, but neopterin and biopterin were abnormal in only one sibling. The results of this research indicates that when diagnosing the SR deficiency, the quantification of sepiapterin in the CSF is more important and indicative of SR deficiency than using neopterin and biopterin alone. The results also show that the urine concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites are abnormal in patients with this disorder. This finding may provide an initial and easier indication of the deficiency before CSF analysis is performed.|$|E
