500|$|Lonsdale Force's sector {{covered the}} {{southern}} end of the eastern perimeter, and Cain was one of three Majors defending this sector of the line. [...] As the battle progressed he became determined to destroy as much enemy armour as possible and sited himself in a laundry's garden, much to the chagrin of the Dutch owner. [...] Over the coming days Cain was everywhere, dealing with armour and snipers and encouraging his men. On the afternoon of Thursday 21st two tanks approached Cain's position. Guided by a colleague in a building above him, Cain waited in a trench until the first tank—actually a StuG III self-propelled gun (SPG)—was close enough to engage. The SPG fired at the building, killing Cain's colleague and showering him with masonry but despite this, Cain kept his position. [...] Staff Sergeant Richard Long of the Glider Pilot Regiment remembered that through the clouds of dust, Cain fired round after round from his PIAT until the SPG was disabled, but whilst engaging the second tank a round exploded in the PIAT with a bright flash and Cain was thrown backwards. Cain recalled thinking he was blind and [...] "shouting like a hooligan. I shouted to somebody to get onto the PIAT because there was another tank behind. I blubbered and yelled and used some very colourful language. They dragged <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the aid post." [...] The British brought forward one of the Light Regiment's 75mm guns which blew the tank apart.|$|E

You see, those society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> respectable distance, say [...] When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among Steiner's {{non-traditional}} views, in {{his autobiography}} titled Errata from 1997, Steiner relates his sympathetic stance towards {{the use of public}} houses since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner states, [...] "My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He sniffed the fear in me with disdain. And marched <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, reassuring to me. There he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I would mind just now, and I hope she'll stay away," [...] he said. [...] "The fact is I have {{something}} to say to you, and don't know why I let you switch <b>me</b> <b>off</b> on <b>to</b> Merril. His affairs can't concern you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, if this youngster {{will keep}} his counsel, there won't be much harm done. And {{to tell the}} truth, I think there's not much chance for us any other way. Now, let <b>me</b> go <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep." ...|$|R
2500|$|In summer 1827 {{the family}} visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly {{and left him}} a {{fragment}} of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: [...] "Only his magnificent features {{and the way he}} took me upon his lap," [...] according to his autobiography. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. [...] "Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> this Paradise lost," [...] he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: [...] "Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album." [...] The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.|$|E
2500|$|Jones pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records {{came as a}} {{surprise}} to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George's honky tonk roots. [...] Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although Billboard chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones Sherrill had his most longest-lasting association. [...] In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of Uncut described as [...] "the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974's The Grand Tour and 1976's Alone Again sound better than happiness could possibly feel." [...] In 1974, they scored a number one hit with the instant classic [...] "The Grand Tour" [...] and followed that with [...] "The Door" [...] (I've heard the sound of my dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war), another number one smash. [...] Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones' voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. [...] While Jones wrote fewer songs himself - songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years - he still managed to co-write several, such as [...] "What My Woman Can't Do" [...] (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), [...] "A Drunk Can't Be A Man", the harrowing [...] "I Just Don't Give a Damn" [...] (perhaps the greatest [...] "lost classic" [...] in the entire Jones catalogue) and [...] "These Days (I Barely Get By)", which he had written with Wynette.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: {{he seemed}} rarely pleased indeed; only I made him {{impatient}} by {{speaking to him}} twice; and then he bid <b>me</b> be <b>off</b> <b>to</b> you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{like the}} name, don't like it. There's no smeddum to it. Besides, {{it makes me}} think of my Aunt Jinny. She called her three girls Faith, Hope, and Charity. Faith didn't believe in anything--Hope was a born pessimist--and Charity was a miser. You ought to be called Red Rose--you look like one when you're mad. I'LL call you Red Rose. And you've roped me into {{promising}} to go to church? But only once a month, remember--only once a month. Come now, girl, will you let <b>me</b> <b>off?</b> I used <b>to</b> pay a hundred to the salary every year and go to church. If I promise to pay two hundred a year will you let <b>me</b> <b>off</b> going <b>to</b> church? Come now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably the old sot {{died in a}} fit, or of {{too much}} brandy. How can one know without a post-mortem? But that mustn't be made by <b>me.</b> I'm <b>off</b> <b>to</b> inform the {{magistrate}} and get hold of another doctor. Let the body remain as it is until I return." ...|$|R

6000|$|Peregrine's mouth twitched ironically, but {{his uncle}} continued, [...] "Look you, my boy, what say you to {{fulfilling}} the augury of your name with me.

6000|$|... "Captain," [...] said I, {{touching}} my sombrero {{to him as}} I {{stood at}} the wheel one day, [...] "It's very hard <b>to</b> carry <b>me</b> <b>off</b> this way <b>to</b> purgatory. I shipped to go elsewhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{visit with}} Arafat {{was among the}} reasons he became estranged from his mother, Hilda Ostermann, who disinherited him.

6000|$|... "You're {{not very}} logical," [...] he replied carelessly. [...] "When I {{took the job}} I {{undertook}} to earn my pay. Cartwright sends <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> float the wreck, and if it's possible, I must make good." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 170. Then I {{thought on}} Solomon, {{and how he}} sinned in loving strange women, falling away to their idols, in {{building}} them temples, in doing this after light, in his old age, after great mercy received: but the same conclusion that cut <b>me</b> <b>off</b> in the former consideration, cut <b>me</b> <b>off</b> as <b>to</b> this; namely, that all those were but sins against the law, for which God had provided a remedy; but I had sold my Saviour, and there remained no more sacrifice for sin.|$|R
60|$|They are all {{in great}} force, and send their loves. They are all much excited with the {{expectation}} of receiving you on Friday, and would start <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> fetch you now if I would go.|$|E

60|$|Get word to my friends! I thanked him; I couldn't do less; {{and about}} this time a lackey came to say I was wanted; so Clarence led me in and took <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> one side and sat down by me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave him}} a shove, you know. I've got a frightfully hasty temper, you know. All the Bassington-Bassingtons have got frightfully hasty tempers, don't you know! And then he biffed {{me in the eye}} and lugged <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> this beastly place." ...|$|E
