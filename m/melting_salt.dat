50|$|In {{cities where}} snow {{steadily}} accumulates {{over the winter}} it is also necessary to remove the piles of snow that build up {{on the side of}} the roads known as windrows or snowbanks. There are a number of methods of doing this. Pulling snow is done when temperatures rise high enough for traffic to melt snow. The windrows are then broken up and spread over the road. Casting is the moving of snow by means of a shovel or plow to nearby public lands. On boulevards or highways winging back is done, which consists of pushing the snow banks further from the road. The most expensive option, but necessary when there are no nearby places to dump the snow, is to haul it away. This is most often done by large self-propelled snowblowers that gather the piles of snow at the side of the road and load it into dump trucks. The snow is then dumped on the outskirts of town, or in a nearby lake, river or harbor. (Some jurisdictions have banned dumping snow into local bodies of water for environmental reasons - modern roads can be contaminated with <b>melting</b> <b>salt,</b> motor oil, and other substances.) Snow melting machines may be cheaper than moving snow, depending on the cost of fuel and the ambient temperature.|$|E

In this study, the influence of the composition of CaBr 2  + H 2 O around the congruent melting CaBr 2 · 6 H 2 O and CaCl 2  + H 2 O around the semi-congruent melting CaCl 2 · 6 H 2 O on the maximum storage capacity is investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For a CaBr 2 concentration around 0. 8  wt% lower than the concentration of CaBr 2 · 6 H 2 O, a decrease of over 17 % is found for the maximum storage capacity.

40|$|A {{conveniently}} assembled membrane-free amperometric sensor {{is proposed}} {{for the detection of}} oxygen in gaseous atmospheres which exploits some profitable properties of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), such as their high electrical conductivity, negligible vapour pressure and good thermal stability. The advantages offered by this type of medium were increased by adding small amounts of a further low <b>melting</b> <b>salt</b> bearing a quinone moiety, which allowed the reduction of O- 2 to occur through an electrocatalytic pathway taking place at quite lower potentials than those required by its direct reduction. The rate constant (14, 160 +/- 370 M- 1 s(- 1)) of this electrocatalytic process was determined by resorting to linear sweep voltammetric measurements. The performance of this device was assayed under both flowing and static stop-flow conditions on synthetic O- 2 + N- 2 atmospheres with a controlled oxygen content, which was changed in a wide range (200 - 10 (6) ppm v/v). At room temperature, repeatable (+/- 2. 7 %) and linearly dependent current signals were recorded, allowing a detection limit of 140 ppm v/v (equivalent to 6. 2 x 10 (- 6) mol of O- 2 per L of gaseous atmosphere) to be inferred. At higher temperatures (100 degrees C) a lower detection limit (10 ppm v/v, equivalent to 4. 5 x 10 (- 7) mol of O- 2 per L of gaseous atmosphere) could be instead estimated. The possibility of profiting from this sensor for monitoring oxygen under reduced pressure was also assayed, in view of the growing importance attached to the evaluation of residual O- 2 in food packaging under vacuum or controlled atmospheres.

40|$|The defect {{behaviour}} {{of the low}} <b>melting</b> <b>salt</b> {{potassium thiocyanate}} has been studied. Ionic conductivity measurements were made on 'pure' single crystals and compressed pellets of KSCN, Diffusion {{studies were carried out}} on single crystals using radioactive tracers. The crystals were grown from the melt using zone refined KSCN which was shown by mass spectrographic analysis to have a low impurity content. The conductivity of the KSCN was measured by an a. c. method. The conductivity and activation energy were reproducible for several crystals giving two regions defined by the following equations:- for the temperature range 130 C - 165 C and for the temperature range 50 C - 120 C. The usual impurity dependence was not observed for the conductivity of KSCN pellets containing various amounts of lead impurity. The conductivity increased throughout the whole temperature range. The effects are discussed in terms of impurity dissolution and the relative number of defects. The diffusion of 42 K was measured by a sectioning method and is represented by the equation:- for the temperature range 40 - 160 C. The formation of free defects appears to be insignificant in controlling the diffusion. Comparison of the diffusion and conductivity results by the Nernst-Einstein relation shows that there is a large contribution to the diffusion by a neutral species, Vacancy pair diffusion is considered to be the cause of this disparity and anion diffusion work confirms this theory, the S 14 CN- diffusion being of the same order as the 42 K+ diffusion. Low values obtained for the impurity diffusion of 210 Pb+ and 35 S 2 - ruled out any significant contribution by impurity vacancy complexes. The phase transition was studied in detail by differential thermal calorimetry and by detailed conductivity and capacitance measurements.

40|$|Waste-fired boilers suffer {{severely}} from corrosion {{of critical}} components such as superheater tubes. In this work the high temperature corrosion of candidate superheater alloys {{have been investigated}} by detailed laboratory studies and controlled field exposures in full-scale boilers. In a laboratory study the detrimental effect of gaseous hydrochloric acid (HCl) on three  different ground surface and preoxidised austenitic stainless steels was investigated. Exposures were conducted in an environment comprising N 2 - 10 O 2 - 5 H 2 O- 0. 05 HCl at both 400 °C and 700 °C. A positive effect of preoxidation is evident when the alloys are exposed at 400 °C. Oxide layers formed during preoxidation effectively suppress chlorine ingress and lower the corrosion rate for all three materials while accelerated corrosion and chlorine accumulation at the metal/oxide interface is detected for ground surface specimens. The positive effect of preoxidation is lost at 700 °C and corrosion resistance is dependent on alloying level. At 700 °C metal chloride evaporation contributes significantly to the material degradation. Based on the results, high temperature corrosion {{in the presence of}} gaseous HCl is discussed in general terms.  In two different waste-fired boilers measures for counteracting superheater corrosion were investigated. In a grate-boiler the deposit formation and high temperature corrosion of some candidate superheater materials were studied. Metal loss measurements showed unacceptably high corrosion rates for the lower alloyed ferritic steels 13 CrMo 44 (Fe- 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo) and HCM 12 A (Fe- 11 Cr- 2 W), {{as well as for the}} austenitic Super 304 (Fe- 18 Cr- 9 Ni- 3 Cu). The corrosion attack for these alloys was manifested by the formation of mixed metal chloride/metal oxide scales. A different type of behaviour was seen for the higher alloyed austenitic steels and nickel-base alloys, which were able to form a chromium-enriched oxide next to the metal. However, the alloys suffered from localised pitting attack. Since analyses of the deposit revealed appreciable amounts of low <b>melting</b> <b>salt</b> mixtures such as ZnCl 2 -KCl, PbCl 2 -KCl, FeCl 2 -KCl and NaCl-NiCl 2, oxide dissolution in these molten salts is the probable reason for pitting attack. In a waste-fired boiler ammonium sulphate solution was added to the flue gas and the effect on flue gas and deposit composition was evaluated. It was evident that the sulphur-rich additive reduced the amount of alkali chlorides in both the flue gas and the deposit. Results also indicated that the initial corrosion rates were lowered with the use of ammonium sulphate. It was concluded that using the additive could be a possible strategy for changing the flue gas chemistry so that superheater corrosion is mitigated.   QC 20110414 </p...|$|E

The formation process of the metal coatings in MCT includes four stages: The nucleation by adhesion, the formation and coalescence of discrete islands, formation and thickening of continuous coatings, exfoliation of continuous coatings.
