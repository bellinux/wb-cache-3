It {{was the second}} public high school in Louisville. <b>Manual</b> merged with its rival, Male High School, into a consolidated school from 1915 to 1919. <b>Manual</b> permanently merged with the Louisville Girls High School in 1950 and moved into their Gothic-style three-story building, built in 1934. In 2004, after conducting a poll, Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper listed <b>Manual</b> as one of Louisville residents' ten favorite buildings. As a coeducational school, <b>Manual</b> experienced a decline in discipline and test scores in the 1970s. In 1984, <b>Manual</b> became a magnet school, allowing students from throughout the district to apply to five specialized programs of study, or magnets.|$|E

5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or <b>manual</b> operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and <b>manual</b> torches are similar in construction, but the <b>manual</b> torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some <b>manual</b> torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

50|$|While {{their use}} in PC games post-2000 is scarce, console games and older PC games are {{expected}} to have them. Games acquired in second hand markets often miss the <b>manuals,</b> much like missing their original boxes, after being kept, lost or discarded by their previous owners. As occasionally the <b>manuals</b> are part of the game experience, owners of games missing <b>manuals</b> try to find replacements in other second-hand stores or with other players or collectors. Alternatively, sites like Replacementdocs provide a large repository of fan-made and official PDF <b>manuals</b> to download.

40|$|Magister Artium - MATechnical {{documentation}} {{comes in}} a variety of forms such as installation or operation <b>manuals,</b> quick reference guides, maintenance <b>manuals,</b> user <b>manuals,</b> policy and procedure <b>manuals</b> or marketing brochures and flyers (Walsh, 2012). What all these sub-genres {{have in common is that}} the texts that correspond to them seek to inform and give instruction about procedures, behaviour and actions related to products (Schäffner & Wiesemann, 2001 : 49). <b>Manuals</b> have been described as “the complete reference source for a product’s operation, maintenance and safety” (Cowley & Wogalter, 2011 : 1773). For the purpose of this study, we will focus on one form of technical documentation, namely user <b>manuals.</b> The terms “documentation” and “manuals” will be used interchangeably. Although there are probably as many <b>manuals</b> as there are products in our homes, these user <b>manuals</b> have not frequently been the subject of academic study in the South African context. The relative lack of research into user <b>manuals</b> is especially regrettable at a time when new product liability legislation and trade regulations (e. g. the Consumer Protect Act of South Africa, 2008) have enhanced the profile of product <b>manuals</b> in public and regulatory discourse. As a result of this relative neglect, it is not known how understandable, relevant and therefore empowering users of products find these <b>manuals.</b> There is also not much knowledge concerning the level of compliance in <b>manuals</b> to the provisions of product liability legislation. This study therefore proposes to investigate the comprehensibility and usability of user <b>manuals</b> associated with two products (blenders) marketed in South Africa. It will draw on theories and methods of analysis associated with technical writing, analysis of terminological consistency, genre and multimodality, to evaluate the selected <b>manuals</b> from the standpoint of a subset of the criteria listed in Section 22 (2) of the Consumer Protection Act of South Africa, No. 68 of 2008, which was later amended in 2011. The methodology for the proposed study will combine text analysis (by the researcher) with comprehension and usability tasks performed by selected participants. Data from these sources will be collated and analysed to determine the conformity of the <b>manuals</b> to criteria in the Consumer Protection Act of South Africa, and the effect the <b>manuals</b> have on product users. Areas for optimising (improving) the <b>manuals</b> will also be identified...|$|R
