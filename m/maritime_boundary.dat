5|$|The <b>maritime</b> <b>boundary</b> between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was {{formally}} settled in 1999, {{but a few}} issues are still contested—the Klek peninsula and two islets in the border area. The Croatia–Montenegro <b>maritime</b> <b>boundary</b> is disputed in the Bay of Kotor, at the Prevlaka peninsula. The situation was exacerbated by the peninsula's occupation by the Yugoslav People's Army and later by the Serbian-Montenegrin army, which in turn {{was replaced by a}} United Nations observer mission that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay, and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 2008, the Court {{ruled that}} Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty, while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia. As regards South Ledge, the Court {{noted that it}} falls within the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, {{it belongs to the}} state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the <b>maritime</b> <b>boundary</b> in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the <b>maritime</b> <b>boundary</b> in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E

40|$|Due to its {{geographical}} location, Indonesia shares border {{areas with}} at least ten neighbouring countries with which <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> must be settled. As of March 2011, Indonesia is yet to finalize its <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> with various States including Malaysia with which four <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> need to be settled: the Malacca Strait, the South China Sea, the Sulawesi Sea, and the Singapore Strait (off Tanjung Berakit). It is evident that pending <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> can spark problems between Indonesia and Malaysia. The dispute over the Ambalat Block in 2005 and 2009 and an incident in the waters off Tanjung Berakit on 13 August 2010 are two significant examples. This paper discusses the incident in the waters off Tanjung Berakit, but will be preceded by {{a description of the}} principles of coastal States 2 ̆ 7 maritime entitlement pursuant to International law of the sea.

5|$|The Adriatic's shores are {{populated}} {{by more than}} 3.5million people; the largest cities are Bari, Venice, Trieste and Split. The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were Etruscan, Illyrian, and Greek. By the 2nd century BC, the shores were under Rome's control. In the Middle Ages, the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled, to a varying extent, {{by a series of}} states—most notably the Byzantine Empire, the Serbian Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria. Following Italian unification, the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century. Following World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the eastern coast's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania. The former disintegrated during the 1990s, resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia's successor states, but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian-Herzegovinian, and Montenegrin waters are still disputed. Italy and Albania agreed on their <b>maritime</b> <b>boundary</b> in 1992.|$|E

40|$|The Pacific island States possess limited land {{territory}} but enormous maritime entitlements. Claims to maritime jurisdiction out to 200 nautical miles offshore, {{and in some}} cases the existence of continental shelf rights extending beyond the 200 mile limit, have resulted in overlapping claims and the creation of numerous “new” international <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The majority of these potential <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> both among the Pacific island States and between the Pacific island States and their maritime neighbours have yet to be delimited. The paper outlines relevant claims to maritime jurisdiction including recent submissions regarding outer continental shelf limits, explores how <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> are to be delimited and examines progress towards the delimitation of potential <b>maritime</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the Pacific islands region before concluding with some preliminary thoughts on the key challenges involved in this context...|$|R
