Nevertheless, this shows that the Hungarians used again the psychological warfare tactics, making the enemy troops to be frightened, or to lose their will to fight, or to be exaggeratedly self-conceited, which made them easier to defeat. The Hungarians also used the psychological warfare in another battle occurred 11 years earlier: the Battle of Brenta River, feigning defeat in an early skirmish, then running away, showing to the enemy commanders that they had despaired, then sending envoys to them asking for forgiveness, with this convincing the enemy to feel pretentious and comfortable, then striking in an unexpected moment and destroying the Italian army.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the rise}} of {{popularity}} of neo-grotesque sans-serif typefaces such as Helvetica in the 1950s, which featured a more homogeneous design {{across a range of}} styles, Monotype attempted to redesign Monotype Grotesque around 1956 under the name of 'New Grotesque' in a more contemporary style after Pierpont's death in 1937. The project proved abortive (Monotype's obituary of Morison described him as having agreed to it 'without any great enthusiasm'), and did not progress beyond the release of some alternative characters. Monotype ultimately came to licence Univers, Adrian Frutiger's extremely comprehensive new family, from Deberny & Peignot. Historian James Mosley has commented that [...] "orders unexpectedly revived" [...] for it around 1960, partly as Univers was only slowly made available on the popular Monotype system, [...] "or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want to use the rather bland Univers anyway." [...] Mosley wrote in 1999 that the interest in its eccentric design [...] "represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties," [...] and that [...] "its rather clumsy design seems to {{have been one of the}} chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the...prettiness of Gill Sans".|$|E

40|$|A community, for ecologists, is a {{unit for}} {{discussing}} collections of organisms. It refers to collections of populations, which consist (by definition) of individuals {{of a single}} species. This is straightforward. But communities are unusual kinds of objects, if they are objects at all. They are collections consisting of other diverse, scattered, partly-autonomous, dynamic entities (that is, animals, plants, and other organisms). They often lack obvious boundaries or stable memberships, as their constituent populations not only change but also {{move in and out}} of areas, and in and out of relationships with other populations. Familiar objects have identifiable boundaries, for example, and if communities <b>do</b> not, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> are not objects. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not exist at all. The question this possibility suggests, of what criteria there might be for identifying communities, and for determining whether such communities exist at all, has long been discussed by ecologists. This essay addresses this question as it has recently been taken up by philosophers of science, by examining answers to it which appeared a century ago and which have framed the continuing discussion...|$|R

When the bridegroom arrives as the bride's house, after he has paid ransom for his bride, the bride and bridegroom perform this ritual together, in front of both of their parents. In the combined blessing ceremony, the elder (starosta) first asks the couple's parents to sit on benches. Once seated, a long embroidered cloth, rushnyk is placed on their lap, and everyone is given a loaf of wedding bread. The starosta recites a ceremonial text such as the following: [...] "As these two children stand before their own mother, before their own father, before their uncles, before their godparents; <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not listen to one of you, I ask you to forgive them and bless them." [...] In Ukrainian, the word proschannia is used to describe forgiving someone of their offenses as well as bidding them farewell. Then the family members repeat [...] "Bih sviatyi" [...] (May Holy God forgive and bless you) three times. The couple then bows to their parents and kisses their faces, hands, and feet. This blessing is performed three times. This ritual symbolizes forgiveness for any sins, and a blessing of the marriage from the parents.|$|E

That said, the book’s most valuable offering to popular music studies more generally may well lie in what we can learn from its distinctly anthropological agenda.

Furthermore, many Dutch organisations we approached answered {{they did not want to}} participate because they were ‘over-researched’ in this area; we were not the first who asked them to participate in a study on age-management. In general, we found that smaller organisations were less willing to participate than larger organisations. Although many kinds of initiatives may be ‘good practices’ and contain ‘pathways to good practices’, small organizations do not seem to perceive their attitudes and actions as age-management and maybe even feel uncomfortable with a ‘good practice’ label...|$|E

40|$|Over {{two decades}} of exoplanetology have yielded {{thousands}} of discoveries, yet some types of systems are yet to be observed. Circumstellar planets around one star in a binary have been found, but not for tight binaries (< 5 AU). Additionally, extra-solar moons are yet to be found. This paper motivates finding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical probabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual inclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body motion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and make it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5 - 10 yr. Circumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational challenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature that {{may be difficult to}} identify. This may help explain their present non-detection, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> simply <b>do</b> not exist. Whilst this paper considers binaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries favourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes {{to the point of being}} guaranteed. Transits of exomoons exhibit a similar behaviour under precession, but unfortunately only have one star to transit rather than two.
