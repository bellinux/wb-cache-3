30|$|Treatment of {{complicated}} <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> and their variants remains a challenge. Much {{of the literature}} reporting on treatment and outcomes combines pediatric and adult injuries. Although closed treatment remains standard for most pediatric <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures,</b> internal fixation is mandatory in adults [15]. Despite the potentially disabling and often unpredictable complications inherent to open fixation, {{recent studies have shown}} satisfactory results in 55 – 83  % of <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> when treated with anatomic reduction and stable plate fixation that permits early mobilization [4, 16]. Anatomic alignment of the ulnar fracture with restoration of the trochlear notch typically allows for a manageable reduction of the proximal radiocapitellar joint and, consequently, a satisfactory result.|$|R
30|$|<b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> are {{typically}} associated with high-energy impact—they are most commonly due to a fall on an outstretched hand in forced pronation, as was evidenced in our case. As ulnar displacement increases, the radial head is levered out of the joint, resulting in the classic deformity [8, 9]. Despite this, <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> and their variants are rare and are often missed injuries.|$|R

50|$|Direct blow on back {{of upper}} forearm {{would be a}} very {{uncommon}} cause. In this context, isolated ulnar shaft fractures are most commonly seen in defence against blunt trauma (e.g. nightstick injury). Such an isolated ulnar shaft fracture is not a <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> It is called a 'nightstick fracture'.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> may {{be managed}} {{conservatively}} {{in children with}} closed reduction (resetting and casting), but due to high risk of displacement causing malunion, open reduction internal fixation is typically performed.|$|R
40|$|Monteggia fracture-dislocations are {{uncommon}} in childhood. Correct early diagnosis {{is essential to}} avoid elbow dysfunction and the necessity for open reduction of the radial head. This retrospective analysis of 220 forearm fractures in children shows that 50 % of <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> were misdiagnosed by accident and emergency (A&E) department senior house officers (SHOs) and 25 % were misdiagnosed by senior radiologists.

30|$|Using {{the only}} {{previously}} existing classification scheme introduced by Sen et al.

50|$|The Hume {{fracture}} is {{an injury}} of the elbow comprising a fracture of the olecranon with an associated anterior dislocation of the radial head which occurs in children.

30|$|Originally {{described}} by Giovanni Monteggia in 1814, the <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> pattern {{has gone through}} a few revisions [1]. Further subclassified by Bado and later by Jupiter, this fracture pattern warrants immediate attention and (usually) a trip to the operating room for definitive reconstruction [2 – 5]. In general, fracture involvement of both the radius and ulna with a concomitant radial head dislocation describes the fracture pattern [6]. In attempts to further understand the injury, other <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> variants and equivalents have also been described [2, 7].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction In a <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation, it is {{important}} to reduce the ulnar fracture completely. Extensive plastic deformation of the proximal ulna may make reduction by closed manipulation impossible. Case presentation We report the case of a four-year-old Caucasian boy in whom the plastic deformation of the proximal ulna was reduced, and this reduction was maintained, using intra-medullary stacked nailing. Conclusion The technique of stacked nailing is a useful addition to the armamentarium in the management of the potentially awkward <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|This paper reports {{an unusual}} and undescribed Monteggia variant {{which was not}} {{diagnosed}} at its initial presentation. An extensive literature search did not reveal any similar case reports.

30|$|Nonunion after {{operative}} {{treatment of a}} displaced fracture of the olecranon is very uncommon and usually related to patient noncompliance and/or insufficient surgical technique with implant failure. Nonunions of the proximal ulna are associated with complex injury patterns such as anterior or posterior fracture-dislocations of the olecranon and posterior <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures.</b> In particular, posterior Monteggia injuries in adults typically occur in older women with poor bone quality. They {{can be difficult to}} secure resulting in inadequate plate fixation and subsequent nonununion.|$|R
50|$|Complications of ORIF {{surgery for}} <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> can include non-union, malunion, nerve palsy and damage, muscle damage, arthritis, tendonitis, infection, {{stiffness}} {{and loss of}} range of motion, compartment syndrome, audible popping or snapping, deformity, and chronic pain associated with surgical hardware such as pins, screws, and plates. Several surgeries {{may be needed to}} correct this type of fracture as it is almost always a very complex fracture that requires a skilled orthopedic surgeon, usually a 'specialist', familiar with this type of injury.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction A Monteggia facture {{dislocation}} is not {{an uncommon}} injury, and the diagnosis can often be missed. Long-term follow-up of untreated <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocations reveals development of premature arthritis, pain, instability, and loss of pronation and supination. Methods involving annular ligament reconstruction require post-operative immobilization and use of transcapitellar pinning for maintenance of reduction, and thus a delay in rehabilitation. The literature reports satisfactory results with methods that involve ulnar osteotomy and open reduction of the radial head without annular ligament reconstruction. We used the Ilizarov method in two cases with neglected <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocations to stably reduce the radial head without open reduction and annular ligament reconstruction. Case presentation We report two cases of neglected <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation, in two Kashmiri boys aged four and six years. Using ulnar osteotomy with distraction osteogenesis, {{we were able to}} relocate the radial head gradually and maintain the reduction without a requirement for open reduction and annular ligament reconstruction. Conclusion Distraction lengthening and hyperangulation in different planes by use of the Ilizarov technique effectively reduces the radial head without open reduction and annular ligament reconstruction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. In 1814 Giovanni Monteggia first {{described}} two cases of fractures of the proximal third of ulna with dislocation of the radial head. These fractures {{are more common}} in children than in adults, and mutual <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> is a rare complication. This study presents a treatment course of a patient with bilateral <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> Case report. A 55 - year-old patient was injured by falling in the yard. Radiography showed bilateral <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> type II (by the Badon classification). Operative treatment of fracture was done by a compression plate {{on the right side}} and by the zuggurtung technique on the left one. Closed repositioning of the radial head was done on both sides. The patient was wearing a plaster splint for the upper arm for 21 days. After removing the fixation, the function of the elbow was determined by the Broberg Morrey score (BM) which was on the right side 45. 5 and on the left side 47. 5. After the proper physical therapy, four months after the surgery, BM score was 100 on the right side, and 93 on the left one. Conclusion. Surgical treatment and early rehabilitation is the key for the return of good function of both elbows...|$|E
30|$|<b>Monteggia</b> and Galeazzi <b>fractures</b> are {{unstable}} {{injuries and}} account for 1 – 2 % and 3 – 5 % of forearm fractures, respectively [1]. A combined <b>Monteggia</b> and Galeazzi <b>fracture</b> is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 11 cases of combined <b>Monteggia</b> and Galeazzi <b>fractures</b> {{are reported in}} the literature; two of which refer to children [2, 3, 4, 5]. None of the reported cases refers to a bipolar Monteggia and Galeazzi injury.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The records {{concerning}} ten consecu-tive {{years of}} experience with <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> in adult patients at a level-one trauma center were retro-spectively reviewed. Forty-eight patients who had been followed {{for a minimum of}} two years (average, 6. 5 years; range, two to fourteen years) were identified. There were twenty-five women and twenty-three men, and the aver-age age was fifty-two years (range, eighteen to eighty-eight years). According to the classification of Bado, there were seven type-I, thirty-eight type-II, one type-III, and two type-JTV injuries. Twenty-six patients (68 percent) who had a Bado type-II fracture had an asso-ciated fracture of the radial head; ten of these patients also had a fracture of the coronoid process as a single large fragment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neglected <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> {{dislocation}} {{in children}} constitutes significant disability {{in respect to}} pain, stiffness, deformity, neurological compromise and restriction of activities of daily living. Many surgical technique have been described to manage neglected <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation and common technique is the ulnar osteotomy for restoration of the ulnar length and reduction of the radial head with annular ligament reconstruction for restoration of the elbow biomechanics for this difficult problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study 13 patients with mean age of 7 years and 7 months, who presented with neglected <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation, were studied. The time interval between injury and presentation mean 7. 2 months and ranged from 2 months to 25 months. The patients were classified according to Bado. All children underwent open reduction of the radiocapitellar joint, Ulnar osteotomy with angulation distraction and annular ligament reconstruction by fascia lata. We used Kim’s score the for evaluation of our results. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 40. 8 months. One of them without ulnar osteotomies healed uneventfully. Ulnar angulation at osteotomy site (°) mean 21. 3 ° (16 - 25 °); Ulnar lengthening at osteotomy site (cm) mean 0. 85 cm (0. 5 - 1. 8 cm); Improvement Pre- Potoperation: Flexion-Extention 20. 3...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -month-old German {{shepherd}} {{dog with}} a combination of a proximal radial physeal fracture and a proximal ulnar diaphyseal comminuted fracture, with cranial displacement of their distal fragment, was presented. This fractures combination resembles type I <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> After surgical reduction of the fractures, three full-cerclage wires were used to stabilize the ulnar fracture, and two positional screws were placed across the radius and ulna immediately distally to the growth plate to hold these bones in apposition. Four weeks post-operatively, the screws were removed since sufficient callus had been formed and the dog was free of lameness. It seems that if the appropriate conditions for a type I <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> develop in an immature dog, proximal radial physeal fracture instead of radial head luxation may accompany ulnar diaphyseal fracture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report an}} {{extremely}} rare case of tardy posterior interosseous nerve palsy that developed 40 years after unreduced anterior dislocation of the radial {{head in a}} <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> Case presentation A 46 -year-old Asian woman was diagnosed with tardy posterior interosseous nerve palsy resulting from residual dislocation of the radial head in a <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture.</b> The patient remembered that she had sustained a fracture to the right elbow when she was 6 years old but could not remember the details of either the injury or its treatment. Intra-operatively, the posterior interosseous nerve was compressed at the radial head, wrapped around the medial side of the radial neck, {{and ran into the}} distorted supinator muscle, and was stretched. We therefore excised the radial head and performed neurolysis. The function of the right hand was normal at a follow-up examination 8 months after surgery. Conclusion We theorize that excessive repeated motion with loss of elasticity of surrounding tissues because of long-term dislocation of the radial head may cause delayed posterior interosseous nerve palsy. It is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and render proper treatment when a <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> occurs, making sure that the radial head does not remain dislocated, to avoid possible posterior interosseous nerve palsy due to excessive pronation and supination even several decades later. </p...|$|E

30|$|<b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> {{are mainly}} {{associated}} with falls on an outstretched hand with forced pronation [10]. The decision on operative or non-operative treatment {{is based on}} the injury pattern and the patient’s age. Most pediatric fracture patterns can be managed non-operatively with closed reduction and long-arm casting, as long as reduction in the radial head is confirmed, while most adult fractures call for open reduction and internal fixation [11, 12]. More specifically, in children for Bado types I–III fractures, closed reduction in ulna and radial head dislocation and long-arm casting immobilization in 110 ° of flexion and full supination is preferred. Indications for operative treatment in those cases are: an open fracture, an acute type IV Bado fracture, instability of the radial head or inability to maintain ulnar length [11, 12].|$|R
40|$|<b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> are {{accepted}} as hard-to-recognize and easy-to-handle fractures. Adequate radiographic investigations and clinical examinations are necessities. This case holds unique features involving diagnosis and treatment. In this case, the radial head was dislocated laterally while both bones were fractured in the proximal diaphysis, {{being the first}} to be mentioned in the literature. Closed reduction of the ulna is the preferred method of handling and almost always results in reduction of the radial head. Literature obligates ulnar reduction as a preliminary to reduce and stabilize the radial head. Closed reduction reduced the ulna but the radial head was not reduced. Hence an intramedullary K-wire was used to reduce the radial head and a long arm cast was used to stabilize the reduction. The operation was successful and follow-up showed no complications...|$|R
30|$|The present case shows a {{fracture}} dislocation pattern unrelated to any previously described elbow dislocation, bifocal ulnar fracture and radial head fracture.

Different fracture patterns are associated with different ligament damages.|$|E
40|$|A <b>Monteggia</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> is {{a fracture}} of the proximal ulna {{coupled with a}} radial head dislocation. Numerous classification systems {{have been developed to}} characterize these fractures. Bado classification is most commonly used. Bado type 1 Monteggia fractures are most common while type 3 & 4 are rare entities. In our case, after confirming the diagnosis as type 4 Bado <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation, patient was posted for open reduction and internal fixation. The ulnar and radial fractures were rigidly fixed with 3. 5 compression plate and ulnar length restored. However, the radial head was still found to be dislocated anteriorly on fluoroscopy. An attempt of closed reduction of the radial head failed. Open reduction of the radial head was performed under image intensifier and fixed with a Kirschner’s wire followed by im-mobilization in hyperflexion for 2 weeks. The patient followed {{up at the end of}} 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks follow-ing injury and gradual mobilisation of the elbow joint was made. Further follow up at 6 months and 1 year showed complete return of routine function. As soon as the ulnar length is restored by rigid internal fixation, radial head is itself reduced in majority of <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> dislocation where only ulnar fracture is involved. However, in cases of both bone forearm fracture with radial head dislocation, even after restoring the length of ulna and radius, operative reduce-tion of radial head is essential...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} open reduction and ulnar osteotomy on missed Monteggia fractures in children. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary care center orthopaedic hospital in Pellenberg, Belgium. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Six children between 2 and 6 years old who sustained a <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fracture</b> that was initially missed were treated at our institute. They presented in our hospital 5 to 59 weeks postinjury. INTERVENTION: Open reduction of the radial head was performed, combined with a dorsal opening wedge osteotomy of the proximal ulna and fixation with plate and screws. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Mobility of the elbow was measured by an independent observer, evaluating flexion-extension and pronation-supination preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: All patients regained a normal range of motion, the radial head remained relocated, and the axis of the forearm remained normal.

40|$|Pediatric elbow {{fractures}} can {{be challenging}} to manage. Compression of the medial column in Gartland Type I and Type II supracondylar fractures must be reduced to prevent varus deformity. Gartland Type III fractures may be stabilized with two lateral pins or a medial lateral cross-pin technique. Non-displaced lateral condyle fractures require vigilant follow-up. Open reduction of displaced lateral condyle fractures should avoid posterior dissection. T-condylar fractures in children rarely have the articular comminution found in adults. <b>Monteggia</b> <b>fractures</b> in children can be managed well if recognized and treated promptly. Restoration of the ulnar length often reduces the radial head. Angulated proximal radius fractures need to be reduced in order to restore the ability to supinate and pronate.
