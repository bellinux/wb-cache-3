We adopted a hierarchical verification method, which relies on the built-in hierarchy of the design as the mechanism to conquer its verification complexity. We then applied a number of tool guided abstraction and reduction techniques within FormalCheck to avoid state space explosion. The case study we considered is the Transmit Master/ Receive Slave (TMRS) Telecom <b>megacell</b> from PMC-Sierra, Inc., implementing a SCI-PHY (Saturn Compatible Interface for ATMPHY devices) protocol. Using our approaches, we succeeded the model checking of the TMRS design {{and were able to}} uncover a number of flaws in the RTL design {{as well as in the}} documentation specification...|$|E

The success of this new methodology has led the microelectronics industry to create a new class of machines, called Fuzzy Machines, to overcome the limitations of traditional computing systems when utilized as Fuzzy Systems. This paper gives an overview of the methods by which Fuzzy Logic data structures are represented in the machines (each with its own advantages and inefficiencies).

40|$|The {{development}} of digital ASIC's {{with a large}} area states a lot of doubts when the ingenieer must design a test strategy. The design of an industrial circuit advises a test to be made quite similar to the normal field functioning. If {{the size of the}} die is large or quite complex this idea can be unreachable. The techniques of automatic test maybe relevant, thought it should be increased the cell and routing area. If the circuit has been designed with a hierarchical manner with separated blocks, or works with some precompiled <b>megacells,</b> the application of these techniques can be inadvisable, so that we suggest a mixed solution.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a physically based stochastic approach that allows {{to predict the}} narrowband fading statistics for macro- and megacellular networks operating in urban areas. On one hand, macrocellular channels have been mainly covered in the literature by means of empirical models. On the other hand, <b>megacells</b> are typical of upcoming communication systems, such as broadband wireless access and high-altitude platform-based networks. Generally, the path gain of a wireless fading channel can be statistically characterized by a Ricean distribution, which includes Rayleigh fading as a particular case. The key parameter of the distribution is the K-factor K, defined as {{the ratio of the}} dominant component to the scatter contribution. In this paper, the K-factor is estimated by means of a physical model, conditionally to a set of geometrical parameters, such as the building height, the street width and the base station-to-terminal distance. These parameters are statistically described by analytical distributions. The model is successfully compared with experimental data at 1. 6 GHz and typical applications are presented. Finally, because of its physical background, the model performs very well in analyzing polarization (MIMO) multiplexing schemes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: HDLC {{controller}} <b>megacell</b> is a {{high performance}} module for the bit oriented, switched, non-switched packet transmission module. The controller fulfills the specifications according to ITU q. 921, X. 25 level 2 recommendations. It supports half duplex and full duplex communication lines, point-to-point and multipoint channels. Furthermore, the controller is designed to permit synchronous, code transparent data transmission. The control information is always {{in the same position}} and specific bit patterns used for control differ dramatically from those representing data that reduces the chances of errors. The data stream and transmission rate is controlled by the network node. In this paper, we have designed, simulated and implemented HDLC controller. This design is coded in a hardware description language (VHDL). The function of coded design is to simulate on simulation software (e. g. modelsim). After simulation, the design is synthesized and translated into a structural architecture, in terms of the components on the target FPGA device (Spartan 3) and perform the post-translate simulation in order to ensure the proper functioning of the design after translation. After the successful simulation of the post-translate model, the design is mapped to the existing slices of the FPGA and the post-map model simulated. The post-map model does not include the routing delays. The objective {{of this paper is to}} run the programmed FPGA at frequency i. e. it Operates up to 155. 52 Mbits/s data rates. In this paper, we implemented the various HDLC controllers for 16 -bit address, 8 bit data and 16 bit CRC Check, simulation result for final output at the receiver end for 8 -bit data 16 -bit address and 16 -bit CRC, with bit stuffing and removal of error in HDLC...|$|E
