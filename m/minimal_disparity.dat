40|$|AbstractA parity {{subgraph}} of a graph is a spanning subgraph {{such that}} the degrees of each vertex have the same parity in both the subgraph and the original graph. Known results include that every graph has an odd number of minimal parity subgraphs. Define a disparity subgraph to be a spanning subgraph such that each vertex has degrees of opposite parities in the subgraph and the original graph. (Only graphs with all even-order components can have disparity subgraphs). Every even-order spanning tree contains both a unique parity subgraph and a unique disparity subgraph. Moreover, every <b>minimal</b> <b>disparity</b> subgraph is shown to be paired by sharing a spanning tree with an odd number of minimal parity subgraphs, and every minimal parity subgraph is similarly paired with either one or an even number of <b>minimal</b> <b>disparity</b> subgraphs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe visual {{direction}} of a continuously presented monocular object is captured by the visual {{direction of}} a closely adjacent binocular object, which questions the reliability of nonius lines for measuring vergence. This was shown by Erkelens, C. J., and van Ee, R. (1997 a,b) [Capture of the visual direction: An unexpected phenomenon in binocular vision. Vision Research, 37, 1193 – 1196; Capture of the visual direction of monocular objects by adjacent binocular objects. Vision Research, 37, 1735 – 1745] stimulating dynamic vergence by a counter phase oscillation of two square random-dot patterns (one to each eye) that contained a smaller central dot-free gap (of variable width) with a vertical monocular line oscillating in phase with the random-dot pattern of the respective eye; subjects adjusted the motion-amplitude of the line until it was perceived as (nearly) stationary. With a continuously presented monocular line, we replicated capture of visual direction provided the dot-free gap was narrow: the adjusted motion-amplitude of the line was similar as the motion-amplitude of the random-dot pattern, although large vergence errors occurred. However, when we flashed the line for 67 ms at the moments of maximal and <b>minimal</b> <b>disparity</b> of the vergence stimulus, {{we found that the}} adjusted motion-amplitude of the line was smaller; thus, the capture effect appeared to be reduced with flashed nonius lines. Accordingly, we found that the objectively measured vergence gain was significantly correlated (r= 0. 8) with the motion-amplitude of the flashed monocular line when the separation between the line and the fusion contour was at least 32 min arc. In conclusion, if one wishes to estimate the dynamic vergence response with psychophysical methods, effects of capture of visual direction can be reduced by using flashed nonius lines...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{there is}} a {{requirement}} to rehabilitate land altered by mining operations. The recovery of such landscapes can be long and protracted due to the often large disturbance caused by mining. It is important to monitor ecosystem recovery to ensure it is progressing towards the pre-determined end-use. In Queensland, monitoring criteria are predominantly based on vegetation, soil physico-chemical conditions and landform stability. To ensure recovery is efficient, management practices are often conducted to improve individual aspects of the rehabilitated ecosystem. These management procedures typically target vegetation parameters (such as increasing biodiversity) and can cause secondary disturbances to the system. Generally, minimal {{attention is paid to}} the impact of such secondary disturbances on other biota. Ants have been widely used as bioindicators {{to assess the impact of}} land management practices and, in particular, the rehabilitation of mine sites. However, there is limited published research on the influence of secondary disturbances on ant communities at recovering landscapes such as those presented post-mining. The question thus arises as to whether ant communities in these systems are more sensitive to subsequent management practices compared to those occurring on land not previously disturbed by mining. In this research, ant communities were examined as bioindicators of the assessment of management practices or secondary disturbances on two rehabilitated mines. Firstly, at a rehabilitated sand mine on North Stradbroke Island, the differences between ant communities at sites subjected to clearing, prescribed burning and/or wildfire were studied. Unmined habitats were also examined to determine whether the post-rehabilitation disturbances were facilitating ant succession to a composition similar to that in surrounding natural areas. Data from approximately two years after the last secondary disturbance showed that these sites contained a simple ant community composed primarily of non-specialised species, typical of disturbed but unmined habitats. Despite this basic community structure, many specialist and late successional ants were also present. Data collected at three years post-disturbance showed that ant composition at managed rehabilitation sites increased in similarity to the unmanaged rehabilitation site, suggesting the impacts of the management practices were short-term. Regardless of this, multivariate analyses indicated that the ant communities in the rehabilitation areas remained substantially different to those in the unmined native habitat. Therefore, the various management practices imposed did not facilitate convergence to the native ant composition. This may be because not enough time has elapsed since rehabilitation or it may be due to differences in vegetation composition and habitat structure. It is recognised that it may be unrealistic to assume that ant communities at the rehabilitated sites will converge with those in unmined areas due to the intrinsic nature of the biophysical alterations resulting from mining. At a second location in central Queensland (Norwich Park Coal Mine), the ant communities on rehabilitated pastures with different grazing histories were investigated and compared to the ant fauna of nearby unmined sites. Results showed that there was <b>minimal</b> <b>disparity</b> in the ant characteristics assessed between rehabilitated pasture with no, low, medium and high levels of cattle grazing. However, the cattle had been removed from paddocks approximately two years prior to ant sampling, possibly allowing sufficient time for both vegetation and ant communities to restructure. A rehabilitated pasture that had continuous very low grazing up until ant sampling, showed a composition similar to the other rehabilitation sites, but with additional species that were otherwise found only at the unmined reference sites. Analysis of vegetation and habitat variables suggested that the composition of ants was influenced by the cover of sward-forming grasses, particularly buffel. Such cover decreased the amount of bare ground and insolation (affecting thermophilic species) and increased vegetation complexity at ground level (influencing mobility of large species). Habitat alterations created by management practices are suggested to be the primary influence on the ant fauna examined in this research. Ant composition was shaped by habitat structure at both ground level and in the mid- to upperstorey, a response similar to that often observed following disturbances on unmined land. This may indicate that the ant communities in the studied post-mining rehabilitated areas have similar resilience to ants on unmined land subjected to the same management procedures. Additionally, trends in ant parameters were not precisely reflected in vegetation variables, suggesting that more than vegetation surveys in rehabilitation monitoring programs are required for a comprehensive understanding of rehabilitation progression and success. In addition, this thesis examined aspects of ant sampling methodology. Although there has been a call for standardisation for many years, this has not been successfully achieved. Therefore, a component of this project included an extensive literature review and evaluation of sampling methods, leading to recommendations for future standardisation. A methodology trial to determine an appropriate density and sample size of pitfall traps was also conducted. The resulting methodological and procedural advancements provided by this body of work should validate the need to foster greater attention on improving the efficiency and accuracy of ant research...|$|E

However, {{little attention has been}} afforded to other potentialities such its the non-pathological effects of gender, ear asymmetry, and racial heritage. This study aimed to examine normative tympanometric findings in a large sample of Chinese schoolchildren. Using a Madsen 901 Middle Ear Analyzer, data was collected from 269 children (538 ears), ranging in age from 6. 2 - 12. 7 years (mean = 9. 4 years, SD = 1. 7), in Jiangsu province. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the parameters of equivalent car canal volume (chi = 1. 03, SD = 0. 25, 90 % = 0. 68 - 1. 46), peak compensated static acoustic admittance (chi = 0. 58, SD = 0. 34, 90 % = 0. 26 - 1. 13), tympanometric width (chi = 112, SD= 36, 90 % = 62 - 156), and peak pressure (chi = - 25, SD = 30, 90 % = - 85 -+ 10).

40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} {{mathematical}} processing of modern geodetic observations of landslide processes in Dnipropetrovsk on points of observation stations {{in case of}} lost basis points are presented. Previous observations were conducted in 1993 using classic geodetic instruments. To provide the required accuracy of observations the local geodetic coordinate system was developed. There were two basis points; using laser range equipment {{the distance between them}} was measured with accuracy higher than 0. 001 m. New observations were conducted in 2015 using GNSS-technologies and satellite observations in static mode because the traditional methods were impossible to use as the mutual visibility between basis points was lost. The biggest problem in current monitoring was the loss of basis points of monitoring stations. Some suggestions as for choosing the most stable points of network were made. Such points were defined according to previous observations; and the new method of determining the "temporary" basis points by comparing the lengths of lines between points of observation is offered. There were chosen three most stable points with <b>minimal</b> length <b>disparity.</b> Using such method we have transformed satellite observations from WGS- 84 to local coordinate system established at the territory of landslide. Such method could be used in case of lost basis points and with considerable number of rather stable observation points. At the same time, we suggest setting the basis points as far from the landslide observation stations as possible. For further observations, we suggest using GNSS-technologies in static mode and setting the new basis points. To improve the accuracy, the observations on basis points will be combined with GNSS and other ground observations. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} assess whether {{socio-economic}} status (SES) and ethnicity affect adjuvant systemic therapy (AST) guideline adherence in early breast cancer patients in a health care setting with assumed equal access to care. Methods: Data from all female patients surgically treated for primary unifocal early breast cancer between January 2005 and December 2014 were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We assessed the association between SES, ethnicity and non-adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy (ET) guideline indications with Poisson regression models, adjusting for clinicopathological variables. Results: 104, 201 patients {{were included in the}} current analysis. Of patients without an indication, 4 % and 13 % received adjuvant CT or ET ("overtreatment"), whereas 39 % and 14 % of patients with an indication did not receive CT or ET ("undertreatment").

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} community- and family-level factors on racial/ethnic disparities in the uptake of nongroup (individual) health insurance. DATA SOURCES: Responses to the 1996 - 1997 Community Tracking Study Household Survey plus community-level descriptors from several sources including census data, the Area Resource File, and community and migrant health center Medicare cost reports. STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression {{was used to compare}} families in which at least one person had nongroup health insurance to families without nongroup insurance in which at least one person was uninsured. Sequential models were constructed examining family- and community-level factors. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of families with otherwise-uninsured persons purchased nongroup insurance, ranging from 11 % to 41 % among the 60 communities sampled. Disadvantaged minority group members, especially Spanish-speaking Hispanics, had half or less the odds of whites of purchasing nongroup insurance. Education had a weaker association with purchasing nongroup insurance among minority group members than among whites. Community-level factors had <b>minimal</b> effect on <b>disparities</b> in uptake, although greater housing segregation was associated with lower uptake among blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Minority group members are much less likely to purchase nongroup insurance than whites. Family income and community factors do not explain this gap. Programs aimed at stimulating voluntary insurance purchase will continue to underenroll disadvantaged minorities if nonfinancial barriers to acquiring insurance coverage, including the interplay between race/ethnicity and education, are not better understood and addressed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Semiconductor nanocrystals {{have drawn}} a {{considerable}} amount of interest in recent decades from both academia and industry. These crystallites possess a unique property in which the energy of electromagnetic radiation absorbed and/or emitted by the crystallites is inversely correlated with the particle’s size. This phenomenon (dubbed the quantum confinement effect) is immediately integrable with current downconversion technology employed in LCD displays. Substitution of the traditional yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) phosphors, employed in such displays, with red and green emitting nanocrystals offers superior energy efficiency and a wider color palette. In order to attain such enhancements, the nanocrystals employed require <b>minimal</b> size <b>disparity.</b> Cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals are the preferred choice for such displays as their syntheses have matured to afford nearly monodisperse samples across a wide range of sizes. The toxicity of cadmium, however, poses a serious health and environmental risk as well as a barrier to further commercialization. Indium phosphide (InP) stands as the ideal candidate to replace current cadmium based nanocrystals since indium is relatively benign and InP possesses a bulk bandgap that would enable tuning across a wide region of the electromagnetic spectrum through the quantum confinement effect. Attempts to adapt the synthetic techniques which have been proven successful for cadmium based nanocrystal have failed to produce an InP sample with size distributions narrow enough to be competitive. This thesis discusses insights into the nucleation and growth of InP nanocrystals which should prove a valuable resource in rationally designing syntheses of InP with more narrow size distributions. After a brief introduction on the topic, chapter 2 discusses the protonolysis of the P 3 – precursor, P(Si(CH 3) 3) 3, along with the impact this reaction has on the nucleation and growth of InP. Chapter 3 investigates the effect of precursor conversion kinetics on the final particle size and size distribution. In chapter 4, a magic-size cluster is implicated in the inherent difficulty of temporally separating nucleation and growth. The physical structure and electronic properties of the cluster identified in chapter 4 are discussed in chapter 5 as determined by X-ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Finally, chapter 6 investigates the role of primary amines on surface chemistry and thermal stability of magic-size clusters in an attempt to consolidate conflicting literature reports on the effect of primary amines on precursor conversion kinetics...|$|R
