50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus belone) is {{a species}} of marlin native to the Mediterranean Sea where it is {{particularly}} common around Italy. It is an open-water fish, being found within 200 m of the surface. This species can reach a length of 240 cm TL. The heaviest recorded specimen weighed in at 70 kg This species is of minor importance to commercial fisheries.|$|E
50|$|In 1860, Felipe Poey {{gave the}} white marlin the name Tetrapurus albidus. This {{classification}} places the {{species in the}} same genus as shortbill spearfish, <b>mediterranean</b> <b>spearfish,</b> roundscale spearfish, and longbill spearfish. Researchers have identified fossils from the genus Tetrapurus {{dating back to the}} Langhian Age 15 ma (million years ago). Extinct ancestors, such as species from the genus Palaeorhynchus date to as early as 56 ma.|$|E
50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Mediterranean top predator species, such as large pelagic fish, are potentially at risk due to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is investigated. The potential estrogenic effects of PHAHs in three fish species of commercial interest, the top predators bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus belone), were investigated using vitellogenin (Vtg), zona radiata proteins (Zrp) and mixed function oxidases (EROD, BPMO) as diagnostic tools. High induction of Vtg and Zrp {{was detected by}} western blot and ELISA techniques in adult males of X. gladius and T. thynnus thynnus, suggesting that these species are at high toxicological risk in the Mediterranean sea. Comparison of BPMO and EROD activities in the three species indicated, both in male and female, much higher MFO activity in bluefin tuna. This data suggests high exposure of this species to lipophilic xenobiotic contaminants in the Mediterranean environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the swordfish fishery in the Turkish Aegean Sea are presented. A total of 65 boats (6 - 14 m {{in length and}} 11. 5 - 135 hp in engine power) participated in this fishery from two main fishing ports, Sivrice and Fethiye, and the Datça-Bozburun Peninsula. This fishery is also carried out off Antalya Bay. The total annual swordfish catch was 425 t in 2005. The fishing period for swordfish normally takes place during eight months. However, the main activity is concentrated {{in the spring and}} summer seasons on moonless nights, because of the closed season (between October 1 and January 31) and adverse meteorological conditions. Although, there are various fishing gears and techniques for swordfish, the two main fishing gears used in the Aegean Sea are longline and driftnet. About ten non-target species, bluefin tuna, Atlantic black skipjack, albacore, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>spearfish,</b> bullet tuna, dolphinfish, manta ray, sunfish, sharks and dolphins were determined from both longlining and drift-netting. RÉSUMÉ Ce document présente les résultats des programmes de recherche sur la pêcherie d’espadon dans la Mer Egée turque. Au total, 65 bateaux (de 6 - 14 m de long et de 11, 5 - 135 hp de puissance de moteur) ont participé à cette pêcherie, à partir de deux principaux ports de pêche...|$|E
40|$|Maximal {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of key metabolic enzymes were measured in brain and eye heaters of five species of scombroid fishes. Istiophorid billfishes (blue marlin, striped marlin and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>spearfish),</b> xiphiid billfishes (Pacific and Mediterranean stocks) and a scombrid fish (butterfly mackerel) {{were included in}} the analysis. Our main objectives were (1) to assess the maximum possible substrate flux in heater tissue, and (2) to determine what metabolic substrates could fuel heat production. Heater tissue of all scombroids examined showed extremely high oxidative capacity. Activities of citrate synthase, a commonly measured index of oxidative metabolism, included the highest value ever reported for vertebrate tissue. In most billfishes, citrate synthase activities were similar to or higher than those found for mammalian cardiac and avian flight muscle. Marker enzymes for aerobic carbohydrate metabolism (hexokinase) and fatty acid metabolism (carnitine palmitoyltransferase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) also displayed extraordinarily high activities. Activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase measured in heater organs were among the highest reported for vertebrates. These results indicate that heat production could be fueled aerobically by either lipid or carbohydrate metabolism. Inter- and intraspecifically, heater organs of fishes from the colder Mediterranean waters had a higher aerobic capacity and, hence, a greater heat-generating potential, than fishes from the warmer waters of the Pacific. This difference may be attributed to different thermal environments or it may result from allometry, since fishes caught in the Mediterranean were considerably smaller than those caught in the Pacific...|$|E
