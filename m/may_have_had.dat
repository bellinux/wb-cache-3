5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E

5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads.

5|$|After the Roman {{conquest of}} Britain in the 1st centuryAD, Maiden Castle {{appears to have}} been abandoned, {{although}} the Romans <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a military presence on the site. In the late 4th centuryAD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th centuryAD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been inferred to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been inferred to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been inferred to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Mugabe {{remained}} {{suspicious of}} many of ZANLA's commanders and {{had a number of}} them imprisoned. In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty. After Tongogara was {{killed in a car accident}} in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some involvement in it, although these rumours were never substantiated.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found.

5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and}} back ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
