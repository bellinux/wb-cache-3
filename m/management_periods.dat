40|$|Twenty-two {{years of}} water quality time-series {{of the two}} Dutch lakes Veluwemeer and Wolderwijd were subject to {{predictive}} modelling by hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA). The modelling aimed at forecasting changes of the phytoplankton community {{in response to the}} control of external nutrient loadings and fish abundances as consecutively implemented to both lakes since 1979. The water quality time-series of both lakes were structured for HEA modelling in order to reflect the following three different <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> by both training and validation datasets: no management (1976 - 1978), lake flushing and waste water treatment (1979 -onwards) and lake flushing, waste water treatment and food web manipulation (1991 - 1993). This approach facilitated a comparative analysis for the two lakes and the three <b>management</b> <b>periods.</b> Firstly HEA achieved reasonably accurate results for 5 -days-ahead forecasting of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton functional groups. Secondly hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) achieved similar good forecasting results but also provided model representations for chlorophyll-a and algae functional groups in the form of rule sets. HEA has been designed to evolve both the structure of rule sets as well as the parameter values imbedded in the rule sets by means of a genetic algorithm. With regards to the different approaches for eutrophication management, modelling results have shown that only the combination of external nutrient control with food web manipulation has changed the lakes from hypereutrophic to mosotrophic conditions as reflected by the change in the dominance of algae groups and chlorophyll-a concentrations. HEA provides rule sets for the explanation of these ecological changes. The rules revealed that phosphorus limitation by means of seasonal lake flushing and wastewater treatment with food-web manipulation diminished the abundance of the harmful blue-green algae but enhanced the abundance of harmless green algae and diatoms.

40|$|Contemporary {{electricity}} distribution systems are {{being challenged by}} the variability of renewable energy sources. Slow response times and long energy <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> cannot efficiently integrate intermittent renewable generation and demand. Yet stochasticity can be judiciously coupled with system flexibilities to enhance grid operation efficiency. Voltage magnitudes for instance can transiently exceed regulation limits, while smart inverters can be overloaded over short time intervals. To implement such a mode of operation, an ergodic energy management framework is developed here. Considering a distribution grid with distributed energy sources and a feed-in tariff program, active power curtailment and reactive power compensation are formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Tighter operational constraints are enforced in an average sense, while looser margins are enforced to be satisfied at all times. Stochastic dual subgradient solvers are developed based on exact and approximate grid models of varying complexity. Numerical tests on a real-world 56 -bus distribution grid and the IEEE 123 -bus test feeder relying on both grid models corroborate {{the advantages of the}} novel schemes over their deterministic alternatives.

40|$|Electricity storage systems (ESS) for bulk {{energy storage}} are principally used for load {{levelling}} purposes or for relieving the intermittency of renewables. Another use is electricity arbitrage through {{the rule of}} ‘buy low, sell high’. This operation tracks the market-clearing price (MCP) profiles and produces profit by exploiting the differences between peak and off-peak prices. The profits made in this way depend on technology characteristics and the market competition level. We investigate the influence of demand-side management (DSM) on ESS profitability when the only income is from provision of electricity arbitrage services, by optimizing the time allocation of the charge and discharge operations. Two scenarios of DSM in the market have been selected for two <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> (MP) : 1 day and 3 days. The longer MP is examined in order to investigate the potential for higher economic value when energy transfer to the next day is permitted. The key finding is that a very small load shifting from peaks to off-peaks, due to DSM, significantly affects the ESS profit. The significant profit losses the ESS showed {{are a result of}} the high capital costs and the small difference of the peak and off-peak electricity prices in the Greek market. Therefore, under the assumptions we have made for this research, any attempt to use ESS in ‘buy low, sell high’ operation is not profitable...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{has always}} been {{considered}} to be a readily available source of water for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. The last decades, the lack of policymaking for the utilization of groundwater, has led to overexploitation in many areas. The cooperation {{of a wide range of}} scientists such as mathematicians, engineers, computer scientists, environmentalists and economists - operation researchers, have led to the design and construction of commercial computer programs concerned on water management and specifically on the optimal distribution of limited water resources using groundwater management models. These combined models, via simulation and optimization algorithms, result in one optimal solution through operations research and mathematical programming methods. The groundwater management models are based on the method of space superposition or the combination of space and time superposition for steady and unsteady state problems, respectively. In the present study, an algorithm is presented, which minimizes the dimension of the response matrix, concerning on two assumptions: the first is the added fixed cost which represents the water supply pumping well and the second is the removal of time superposition.

We used the National Marine Park of Alonissos, Northern Sporades (NMPANS), Greece, as a relevant case-study to investigate whether the local print media's framing of the marine park and its management affected locals' attitudes. We conducted a longitudinal review of local newspaper articles pertaining to the NMPANS during 1980 - 2008, and we conducted telephone interviews with local people. We found that salience of the NMPANS in the local print media remained limited and sporadic, the main stakeholder remained the centralized public sector, and the regional print media was rather detached, moderate, and largely supportive of the NMPANS throughout 1980 - 2008. The progression of the <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> of the NMPANS, however, was accompanied by increased importance of the NMPANS, increased deviance from conservation as the chief objective of the NMPANS's establishment, a shift from presenting facts to presenting reactions, and a shift from a positive to a mixed image of the NMPANS. Locals who relied on newspapers for local news were better informed about the NMPANS, more likely to accept the NMPANS, and more likely to participate in meetings regarding the NMPANS regardless of gender, age, and occupation than those who did not rely on newspapers.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISI. Peumus boldus, an endemic {{tree species}} of central Chile, belongs to {{sclerophyllous}} forests. Its semi-xerophytes condition {{allows it to}} grow in places with low rainfall and poor soils. The current shrubby condition {{is due to the}} implemented management through a coppice regime. This management was proposed due to its low ability for seed regeneration and its high ability to sprout. Currently, the harvest of this species is mainly based on economic criteria, with a lacking of productivity and technical criteria to define its silviculture. It is essential to understand the response of sprouts after interventions to improve its management. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the response during the first two years of P. boldus coppices with different cutting intensities. A set of 23 strains was annually monitored in three levels of intervention: total, partial (50 % basal area) and without stools cuts (control). Predawn water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, diameter growth and above-ground biomass accumulation were evaluated. Results showed that cuts improved the hydric status and this status was directly related to the cutting intensity of the strains. The same effect was observed in the production and growth of new shoots. Finalizing the evaluation period, accumulated biomass was 17. 9 % in strains with total harvest and 53. 6 % in those with partial harvest.

40|$|Soil carbon can be sequestered through {{different}} land management options {{depending on the}} soil carbon status {{at the beginning of}} a <b>management</b> <b>period.</b> This initial status results from a given soil management history in a given soil climate regime. Similarly, the prediction of future carbon storage depends on the time sequence of future soil management. Unfortunately, the number of possible management trajectories reaches non-computable levels so fast that explicit representations of management trajectories are impractical for most existing land use decision models. Consequently, the impact of different management trajectories has been ignored. This article proposes a computationally feasible mathematical programming method for integration of soil status dependent sequestration rates in land use decision optimization models. The soil status is represented by an array of adjacent status classes. For each combination of soil management and initial soil status class, transition probabilities of moving into a new or staying in the same status class are computed. Subsequently, these probabilities are used in dynamic equations to update the soil status level before and after each new soil <b>management</b> <b>period.</b> To illustrate the impacts of the proposed method, a simple hypothetical land use decision model is solved for alternative specifications.
