5|$|Giant planets (Jovians): Massive planets {{significantly}} <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> {{than the}} terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.|$|E
5|$|In <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> stars, helium is {{produced}} in a cycle of reactions catalyzed by carbon called the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Another massive {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar dust, {{was thought to}} be <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a species}} with slow growth and {{slightly}} arbustive. It forms with time (several years) one or <b>more</b> rather <b>massive</b> trunks.|$|R
50|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} {{that many other}} giraffids thrived between the Miocene era (around 20 million years ago) and the recent past. One major group of extinct giraffids, the sivatheres, had enormous, branching ossicones, and would have looked <b>more</b> like <b>massive</b> deer than giraffes.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{operations}} in the UK have come under intense fire both from those wrongfully convicted and from civil rights groups http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/74690/operation-ore-exposed.html.It is felt by certain lay-people that operations like Auxin are less about targeting actual child abuse and <b>more</b> about <b>massive</b> arrest rates to garner positive media attention http://www.titaniumteddybear.com/?p=169.|$|R
5|$|As the <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in their}} development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they {{contract}} and decrease in luminosity while remaining {{at roughly the}} same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> stars turn onto the Henyey track.|$|E
50|$|The {{extinction}} {{value for}} HM 1 is calculated to be EB&minus;V = 1.85 magnitudes, and its distance was first {{estimated to be}} around 2.9 ± 0.4 kiloparsecs away. Later estimates put the cluster at around 3.3 kiloparsecs away; this {{is still one of}} the <b>more</b> closer <b>massive</b> star clusters.|$|R
50|$|Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide {{containing}} ferric iron. It is {{the main}} component of rust and bog iron ore. Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals ("needle iron ore"), but is <b>more</b> typically <b>massive.</b>|$|R
50|$|With its fine repoussé {{work the}} Mold cape {{represents}} {{the last major}} piece of second millennium BC sheetwork so far discovered. Thereafter, the dominant preference for sheetwork in the British Isles is eclipsed and the evidence is <b>more</b> of <b>massive</b> goldwork {{in the form of}} solid bracelets, twisted bar-flanged torcs, and solid rings.|$|R
5|$|Other exotic atoms {{have been}} created by {{replacing}} one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can {{be replaced by a}} <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> muon, forming a muonic atom. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.|$|E
5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items significantly <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in {{the popular}} press as the tenth planet, failing to receive {{widespread}} scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} told {{in a total of}} {{fourteen}} scenes, each of which is preceded by movement of one or <b>more</b> of the <b>massive</b> stage elements.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{group of}} mounds, located about 10 km {{away from the}} Mozu cluster {{is known as the}} Furuichi cluster. It has the Ōjin-tennō-ryō Kofun of 425 m length which {{is said to be the}} second largest in the country. This group also has 11 <b>more</b> huge <b>massive</b> rounded [...] "keyhole-shaped kofun" [...] with mound length of 200 m or more.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} many {{examples}} of Wei statuary, there are fewer examples from the Northern Zhou, which replaced the Wei with <b>more</b> solid, <b>massive,</b> and sculptural forms. The influences mentioned earlier that came from India (and perhaps SE Asia) begin to be apparent in this period and the subsequent Sui, when stiffly posed figures are replaced by more liquid tribhanga stances.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{of several other}} trans-Neptunian objects approaching the size of Pluto, such as Quaoar and Sedna, continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional {{from the rest of}} the trans-Neptunian population. On July 29, 2005, Mike Brown and his team announced the {{discovery of}} a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than Pluto, named Eris.|$|E
5|$|The <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> the star, {{the shorter}} its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|These trans-Neptunian {{objects are}} {{theoretically}} {{large enough to}} be dwarf planets. Dozens more could have been included. Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined. Both are <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than the 5 kg recommendation of the IAU 2006 draft proposal as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet.|$|E
50|$|A 2005 National Academy of Sciences report {{showed that}} oil mixed with dispersants damaged certain corals' {{reproduction}} and deformed their larvae. The study concluded {{the federal government}} needed to study <b>more</b> before using <b>massive</b> amounts of dispersants.|$|R
50|$|Rams {{battle to}} {{determine}} the dominant animal, which then gains possession of the ewes. Facing each other, rams charge head-on from distances of 20 ft or <b>more,</b> crashing their <b>massive</b> horns together with tremendous impact, until {{one or the other}} ceases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using electricity harnessed by solar panels {{at his home}} studio. Jon O'Brien of Music Is My Oxygen, reviewed the album as [...] "largely <b>more</b> concerned with <b>massive</b> bass drops, irritating high-pitched synths and generic four-to-the-floor beats".|$|R
5|$|Though not {{confirmed}} to be a terrestrial planet and significantly <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than Earth (at 6.98 Earth masses), the Super-Earth {{is the first}} exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star.|$|E
5|$|WISE J003231.09-494651.4 and WISE J001505.87-461517.6 are two {{brown dwarfs}} {{discovered}} by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and are 63 and 49 light years away respectively. Initially hypothesised before they were belatedly discovered, brown dwarfs are objects <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than planets, but which are of insufficient mass for hydrogen fusion characteristic of stars to occur. Many are being found by sky surveys.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
30|$|New {{technologies}} {{are key to}} the development of these informal learning models. Thus, digital Open Educational Resources (OER) and, <b>more</b> recently, <b>Massive</b> Open Online Courses (MOOC) are two different yet related ways of making such development possible. While still emerging and growing, some of these ways appear to be attempts at formalising the informal. Based on traditional transmissive models, some of the models that have been developed are simply makeovers of the old ones, albeit using new technologies to achieve their goals.|$|R
50|$|W Serpentis is the {{prototype}} of a class of semi-detached binaries including a giant or supergiant transferring material to a <b>massive</b> <b>more</b> compact star. They are characterised, and distinguished from the similar β Lyr systems, by strong UV emission from accretions hotspots on a disc of material.|$|R
40|$|SONYC (Substellar Objects in Nearby Young Clusters) is a deep, {{unbiased}} {{imaging and}} spectroscopic survey {{designed to provide}} a census of substellar population in several nearby star forming regions. As a result, the substellar IMF is now well characterized down to 5 - 10 MJup. We are now extending the survey to <b>more</b> distant <b>massive</b> young clusters, characterized by orders of magnitude higher stellar densities and OB star numbers. This new dataset allows us, for the first time, to test the influence that such environments might have on the production of very-low mass objects...|$|R
5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses {{producing}} a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% <b>more</b> <b>massive</b> than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
50|$|Cadrete is a {{small town}} in {{north-east}} Spain, close to Zaragoza. It is notable for its Muslim castle, Mudejar Church and famous Cardoons. <b>More</b> recently, a <b>massive</b> wind-turbine has been installed at less than 300 metres away from the village, producing several landscape damages and high noise rates for town's inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|Harden is killed, but {{takes the}} Taken The Hanged Man with him. The Circle suffers <b>more</b> casualties, but <b>massive</b> rebel forces besiege the Tower. A daring sortie by the Company captures the wizards Feather and Journey, {{weakening}} the Circle further; they are {{transported to the}} Tower to share Whisper's fate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, the Breit {{equation}} {{was found}} to describe two or <b>more</b> electromagnetically interacting <b>massive</b> spin [...] fermions to first-order relativistic corrections; {{one of the first}} attempts to describe such a relativistic quantum many-particle system. This is, however, still only an approximation, and the Hamiltonian includes numerous long and complicated sums.|$|R
