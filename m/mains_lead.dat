One of the most commonly used types of Y-cables are for audio; one end is a 3.5mm (1/8â€³) stereo male minijack, and the other end are two left and right audio channel RCA (phono) male jacks to connect sound card outputs to external speakers, or to the analog audio inputs of televisions.|$|R
40|$|Water {{transmission}} and distribution systems are critical urban infrastructure. The aging of water <b>mains</b> can <b>lead</b> to increased breakage rate, decreased hydraulic capacity, and deterioration of water quality. Condition assessment of water mains encompasses building computational model of failures, discerning distress indicators from inspection, rating health condition, and forecasting future failures. In this process, computational intelligence helps to achieve high-level awareness of system condition and facilitates the decision making in water main renewal and rehabilitation using the combined information from field knowledge, historical records, inspection results, and sensory data. This paper reviews computational approaches to achieve condition assessment of water mains. Inspection and sensor technologies involved in the assessment process are also briefly discussed.

The {{idea of this}} is to remove the need for an internal [...] "dropper resistor." [...] Shortening the lead or replacing it with a copper lead will damage the tube filaments by excess voltage. A fault in the radio has been known to cause the mains leads to overheat with nasty consequences, hence their popular name. Curtain burner sets are usually miniatures.|$|E

40|$|We study numerically {{the density}} of optical states (DOS) in {{two-dimensional}} photonic structures with short-range positional order, and observe a clear transition from polycrystalline to amorphous photonic systems. In polycrystals, photonic band gaps (PBGs) are formed within individual do- <b>mains,</b> which <b>leads</b> to a depletion of the DOS {{similar to that in}} periodic structures. In amorphous photonic media, the domain sizes are too small to form PBGs, thus the depletion of the DOS is weakened significantly. The critical domain size that separates the polycrystalline and amorphous regimes is determined by the attenuation length of Bragg scattering, which depends not only on the degree of positional order but also the refractive index contrast of the photonic material. Even with relatively low refractive index contrast, we find that modest short-range positional order in photonic structures enhances light confinement via collective scattering and interference.

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (<b>mains</b> flex <b>lead)</b> to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} {{systems are}} facing severe power quality problems {{due to the}} uncontrolled use {{of different types of}} linear and non-linear loads such as solid state controllers which will draw harmonics and reactive currents from ac <b>mains.</b> It may <b>lead</b> to poor power quality at ac sources such as sag, swell, notch, flicker, unbalance etc. The installation of the diesel generator set is widely used in practice to feed power to some crucial equipments and in remote areas. DG sets used for these purposes may be loaded with unbalanced, reactive and non-linear loads such as power supplies in telecommunication system and medical equipments. A Zig-Zag Transformer and three-leg VSC based DSTATCOM is used here to compensate the neutral current, harmonic current, reactive power and unbalanced load. The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) based VSC is supported by a capacitor and is controlled for the compensation required in the load current. The dc bus voltage of the VSC is regulated during varying load conditions. In this paper, a Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) controlled three-leg voltage source converter (VSC) based DSTATCOM with a Zig-Zag transformer is used for reactive power, harmonics, unbalanced load current and neutral current compensation in grid connected and islanded mode...|$|R
50|$|The {{charging}} {{power can}} {{be connected to the}} car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as conductive coupling. This might be as simple as a <b>mains</b> <b>lead</b> into a weatherproof socket through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from high voltages. The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the SAE 1772 conductive connector (IEC 62196 Type 1) in the US. The ACEA has chosen the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 (IEC 62196 Type 2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a latch, means unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|A power cord, line cord, or {{mains cable}} is an {{electrical}} cable that temporarily connects an appliance to the mains electricity supply via a wall socket or extension cord. The terms are generally used for cables using a power plug to connect to a single-phase alternating current power source at the local line voltage - (generally 100 to 240 volts, depending on the location). The terms power cable, <b>mains</b> <b>lead,</b> flex or kettle lead are also used. A lamp cord (also known as a zip cord) is a light-weight, ungrounded, single-insulated two-wire cord used for small loads such as a table or floor lamp.|$|E
50|$|Superficially {{similar to}} the Philips N1502 both {{externally}} and internally. There were however very few components interchangeable between the two models. Slower tape-speed and a slant-azimuth recording technique (to almost eliminate cross-talk between video tracks without using tape-wasting guard-bands) made possible the longer playing time without a noticeable loss in picture quality. The <b>mains</b> <b>lead</b> was hard-wired into the machine however later releases of the N1700 had a removable lead - this would become standard on the N1702 model. Also on later models, presumably as the company had already started production of the N1702, the internal Video Head is also sometimes labelled as N1702 instead of N1700.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum tube {{equipment}} used {{a number of}} tubes, each with a heater requiring {{a certain amount of}} electrical power. In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series. All the tubes are rated at the same current (typically 100, 150, 300, or 450 mA) but at different voltages, according to their heating power requirements. If necessary, resistance (which can be a ballast tube (barretter), a power resistor or a resistive <b>mains</b> <b>lead</b> are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|E
40|$|The <b>mains</b> <b>lead</b> of {{this product}} is {{fitted with a}} non-rewireable (moulded) plug {{incorporating}} a 3 A fuse. Should the fuse need to be replaced, a BSI or ASTA approved BS 1362 fuse marked or and of the same rating as above, which is also indicated on the pin face of the plug must be used. Always refit the fuse cover after replacing the fuse. Never use the plug without the fuse cover fitted. In the unlikely event of the socket outlet in your home not being compatible with the plug supplied, cut-off the mains plug and fit an appropriate type. DANGER: The fuse from the cut-off plug should be removed and the cut-off plug destroyed immediately and disposed of in a safe manner. Under no circumstances should the cut-off plug be inserted elsewhere into a 13 A socket outlet as a serious electric shock may occur.
