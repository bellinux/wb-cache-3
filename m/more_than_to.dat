He {{is in love with}} Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E

She would like nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E

5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} before her wedding, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is bitten on the arm by a male shape {{shifting}} alien. Her boss, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) kills the alien, and Gwen attends her hen night though is troubled by her wound. She wakes {{up the next morning}} heavily pregnant. Jack arrives along with Torchwood's medic Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to examine Gwen and tries to persuade her to cancel her wedding. Gwen's fiancee Rhys (Kai Owen) also tries to postpone the wedding in Gwen's interest but Gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> marry him. The sudden pregnancy is explained to Gwen and Rhys' families as their own child. Gwen's mother (Sharon Morgan) and father (William Thomas) are excited at the prospect of a grandchild, but Rhys' parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) is sent to the wedding venue {{to keep an eye on}} Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy.|$|E

This ended up throwing the entire affair into confusion, and rather than humble, he came across as derisive; rather than seeming to want to serve the state, he seemed obstructive. He cited his age as a reason why he could not act as Princeps, stated he did not wish the position, and then proceeded to ask for only {{a section of the}} state. Tiberius finally relented and accepted the powers voted to him, though according to Tacitus and Suetonius he refused to bear the titles Pater Patriae, Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem of the Princeps, the Civic Crown and laurels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{compare the}} cost utility of using {{erythropoietin}} (EPO) to maintain different hemoglobin (Hb) target levels in hemodialysis patients from a societal perspective. MethodsA Markov model {{was used to}} estimate the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life-year of five Hb levels: 9 or less, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 9 <b>to</b> 10, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 <b>to</b> 11, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 11 <b>to</b> 12, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 12 g/dl. A systematic review of EPO treatment in hemodialysis patients was conducted to estimate transitional probabilities. Cost data were estimated {{on the basis of}} the reference price of Siriraj Hospital, the largest university hospital in Thailand. Utility scores were derived from the six-dimensional health state short form (derived from short-form 36 health survey), which were collected from 152 hemodialysis patients receiving EPO at Siriraj hospital. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of uncertain parameters. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at the rate of 3 % per annum. ResultsThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Hb levels <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 9 <b>to</b> 10, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 <b>to</b> 11, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 11 <b>to</b> 12, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 12 g/dl compared with the least costly option (Hb ≤ 9 g/dl) were US $ 24, 128. 03, US $ 18, 789. 07, US $ 22, 427. 36, and US $ 28, 022. 33 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. From probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the hemoglobin level of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 <b>to</b> 11 g/dl was appropriate when the willingness to pay was US $ 15, 523. 88 to US $ 46, 610. 17 and the probability of cost-effective was 29. 32 % to 95. 94 %. ConclusionsProviding EPO for a hemoglobin level of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 <b>to</b> 11 g/dl had a cost-effectiveness higher than that of doing so for other hemoglobin levels. This finding will be put forward to the policy level to set up the EPO treatment guideline of the hospital for hemodialysis patients...|$|R

25|$|The major uprisings {{involved}} the sekbans (irregular troops of musketeers) and sipahis (cavalrymen maintained by land grants). The rebellions were not attempts {{to overthrow the}} Ottoman government but were reactions to a social and economic crisis stemming {{from a number of}} factors: demographic pressure following a period of unprecedented population growth during the 16th century, climatic hardship associated with the Little Ice Age, a depreciation of the currency, and the mobilization of thousands of sekban musketeers for the Ottoman army during its wars with the Habsburgs and Safavids, who turned to banditry when demobilized. Celali leaders often sought no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> be appointed to provincial governorships within the empire, while others fought for specific political causes, such as Abaza Mehmed Pasha's effort to topple the Janissary government established after the regicide of Osman II in 1622, or Abaza Hasan Pasha's desire to overthrow the grand vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.|$|E

25|$|Abbots used to {{be subject}} to episcopal jurisdiction, and {{continued}} generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The Code of Justinian (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from Pope Gregory the Great. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an imperium in imperio, and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese.|$|E
25|$|As {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Raytheon's revenues have been obtained from defense contracts, there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government departments and agencies (e.g. in the Fiscal Year 2007 the National Science Foundation awarded Raytheon $152 million in grants, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> any other institution and organization in the country, for managing NSF South Pole Station). This, along with heavy lobbying, has led to perennial charges of influence peddling. Raytheon, for instance, contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense-related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004, spending much more than that on lobbying expenses. And there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government. For example, Richard Armitage, a former United States Deputy Secretary of State, is linked to the company through consultancy work. John M. Deutch, a former U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, sits on the board of directors, along with Warren Rudman, a former Senator. On the other hand, Raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the U.S. Government.|$|E
25|$|Chua J. {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the basic features doctrine in Singapore. He reasoned that a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, can never be invalid if the procedure for amendment is complied with. If the framers of the Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. Furthermore, if the courts were allowed to impose limitations on the legislative power to amend, they would be usurping Parliament's legislative function, contrary to Article 58. In any case, Chua J. did not agree that Parliament had violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The subjective test reinserted into the ISA had served the national security interests of Singapore for a long time. The amendments merely reaffirmed the law which the courts had followed since Lee Mau Seng, and ensured that the legislative intent behind the ISA was not disregarded. Moreover, nothing in the amendments was unrelated to national security. A reaffirmation of the original principles could not be said to be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of law. The rule of law had not been abolished by legislation, as Parliament had done no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> enact the rule of law relating to judicial review. The legislation did not order the court to decide a case in a particular way or to dismiss it – the court was left to deal with the case {{on the basis of the}} amendments.|$|E
