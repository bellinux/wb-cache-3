40|$|The {{question}} how intergroup bias can be alleviated is of much {{theoretical and practical}} interest. Whereas diversity training and the <b>multiculturalism</b> <b>ideology</b> are two approaches prominent in practice, most theoretical models on reducing intergroup bias are based on social-identity theory and self-categorization theory. This social-identity perspective assumes that similar processes lead to intergroup bias in very different intergroup contexts if people identify with the respective social groups. A recent prominent model based on these theories is the ingroup-projection model. As this model assumes, an ingroup's norms and standards are applied to outgroups included in a common superordinate category (this is called ingroup projection). Intergroup bias results because the outgroup fulfils these norms and standards less than the ingroup. Importantly, if {{the diversity of the}} superordinate category is induced as the norm, ingroup projection and thus intergroup bias should be reduced. The present research delineates and tests how general this process is. We propose that ingroup prototypicality is not only an outcome variable, as the ingroup-projection model originally assumes, but can also be an important moderator. We hypothesize that for members considering their ingroup highly prototypical ("pars pro toto", large majorities), the superordinate group's diversity may question their ingroup's position and thus elicit threat and intergroup bias. In contrast, for members who consider their group as less prototypical (one among several, or "una inter pares" groups), activating diversity should, as originally assumed in the ingroup-projection model, reduce intergroup bias. Three experiments (total N = 345) supported these predictions in the contexts of groups defined by gender or nationality. Taken together, the ingroup-projection model can explain under which conditions activating superordinate-category diversity induces tolerance, and when it may backfire. We discuss in how far the ingroup-projection model can integrate conflicting findings on the <b>multiculturalism</b> <b>ideology...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{cultural}} implications {{associated with the}} intensive presence of foreign labour in the modern and young UAE, with special focus on the potential impact on the cultural particularities forming national identity.   To this end, the study examines the evolution and reality of multicultural society in the country, in conjunction with <b>multiculturalism</b> <b>ideologies,</b> policies and modes pursued elsewhere. The issue is addressed from contextual, conceptual, empirical and comparative perspectives; thus the study concludes that the de facto multiculturalism experienced in the UAE is rather a complex unique model that should be understood on its own merits.   Inter-related topics including globalization, civilisational dialogue and cultural engagement, as being inseparable from the subject matter, are thoroughly discussed, with relevance to UAE’s context. The key recommendation calls for the need for earnest steps to introduce limits to the scope of tolerance prescribed, implicitly or explicitly, under public policy {{in order to maintain}} the continuity of national identity, and consequently contributes to the sustainability of the prevalent co-existence amongst various cultural communities and groups in the country, in line with the open diversified labour-intensive economy. While the present thesis is expected to help initiate discussion on cultural diversity in the UAE, a number of fields have been identified for possible further research on the state of affairs, in particular, potential threats surrounding the local religious and traditional values.

The results show an endorsement of the idea of a plurally composed society shared by the majority of respondents; the results also show reluctance towards specific social participation measures of the allochthonous population. A slight gender effect was found, with women showing higher endorsement of multiculturalism, but no age effect. The support for multiculturalism also rises in line with the educational level achieved. Direct culture contact, operationalized in terms of composition of circle of friends, is also conducive for endorsement of multiculturalism.

To investigate this specific “majority as minority” - perspective a quantitative study was conducted within a large Luxembourg employer (N = 507) which has a mainly native born work force. We examined the endorsement of multiculturalism using an adaptation of the <b>Multiculturalism</b> <b>Ideology</b> Scale and the Social Participation Subscale of the Multicultural Attitude Scale. We tested the relationship between demographic variables, different forms of culture contact experiences, individual values as measured by the Schwartz Values Structure, personality traits and the endorsement of multiculturalism. Furthermore we looked at the understanding of nationality as “socially constructed” versus “primordial” as a predictor of multiculturalism. The results show an endorsement of the idea of a plurally composed society, as well as a reluctance towards specific social participation measures of the allochtonous population. As in previous studies, we found that level of education is an important predictor for the endorsement of multiculturalism. The largest predictive weight however had the value structure with persons high in Self-Transcendence and low in Conservation being more open towards multiculturalism. Further significant predictors for high levels of self-reported multiculturalism include (a) the conviction {{that it is possible to}} have more than one nationality (socially constructed understanding of nationality), as well as (b) culture contact exposure in terms of a mixed composition of the circle of friends. In addition to this, the personality traits agreeableness and openness also played a role for the endorsement of multiculturalism.

40|$|This study investigates how {{immigration}} {{models of}} the post Second World War assimilation policy, subsequently replaced by the <b>multiculturalism</b> <b>ideology,</b> have been empirically perceived by Australian immigrants. Questions point to if modern day migrancy and immigration have transformed {{the ways in which}} the concepts are currently understood. Of particular interest is: are settlement, citizenship and assimilation an end point, or should migrancy be recast as a fluid phenomenon, privileged by greater freedom of ‘belonging’ afforded by transnationalism? Answers to these questions fill gaps in sociological knowledge. The social research project is anchored in a case study of mainly first but not excluding second and a few third generation Greek and Cypriot Australian immigrant respondents. Data gathering employs qualitative inquiry, applying a Mixed Method approach grounded in the Grounded Theory Method. Fieldwork data are generated by in-depth interviewing of respondents, and interpretation of their statements. Their verbal testimonials are analysed using the conceptually clustered matrix. In this approach text is assembled, sub-clustered, and broken into semiotic segments, permitting the researcher to contrast, compare, analyse, and recognise patterns. The strength of employing the Conceptually Clustered Matrix is that it serves the “conceptual coherence” of the data in this study’s single case inquiry. This study reveals how transnationalism has changed presumptions embedded in the policies of assimilation and multiculturalism. In assimilation, supposition of permanent settlement, and the question of ‘belonging’ has been resolved by the immigrants succeeding in effectively transplanting the former ethnic “I”, into becoming a new Australian “me”. Subsequent multiculturalism provides immigrants options in choosing their self-identity within the society at large and accepting that migrant minorities can subsist in discrete ethnic conglomerates clustered within the compass of wider Australian society. The contribution of this thesis to the body of sociological knowledge is that it investigated presently not or under-investigated scholarship how migrants perceive their diaspora existence, redefined by daily practices among migrants. In a transnational context, the research has focused on exploring post-immigration identity and ‘belonging’. Its findings have identified changing perception of migrancy and immigration, framed in terms of the core research question generated in this thesis, namely “after settlement, then what...|$|E

40|$|<b>Multi{{cultural}}ism</b> as <b>ideology</b> {{and policy}} has been criticised for over-focusing on cultural identities and differences {{and a lack of}} focus on the structural inequality of ethnocultural groups. This paper focuses on the latter issue through a comparative analysis of the workforce integration of immigrants to Australia. Past research has shown that non- English-speaking-background (NESB) immigrants were worse off than both the Australia-born and English-speaking-background (ESB) immigrants in achieving a job status and income corresponding to their educational qualifications. The paper compares 2006 Census data on education level, type of job, length of residence and English proficiency for eight NESB groups, one ESB group (UK) and the Australia-born. The investigation focuses on how well different birthplace groups are able to translate their skills into appropriate jobs, when controlling for English proficiency and length of residence. The main finding confirms that NESB immigrants still have worse employment outcomes than the Australia-born and UK-born overall, but some NESB groups match the success of the Anglophone groups in vocational sector employment. Among the tertiary educated, the employment outcomes of the Australia-born are better than those of all immigrant groups, closely followed by the UK-born and two other European groups...|$|R
40|$|Integration’ {{has been}} {{established}} as the preferred rubric for academic discussions, popular polemics and political proposals concerning migration, difference and social futures in globalised nation-states, particularly in western Europe. This amplification owes much to its perceived, corrective relationship to ‘multiculturalism’, widely – and erroneously – regarded as a ‘failed experiment’ requiring rehabilitative action {{on issues such as}} social cohesion, ‘shared values’ and variously grounded common ‘ways of life’. While this shift far exceeds any ordinary etymological or definitional controversy, both terms invite similar forms of ambivalent reading. In Shohat and Stam’s discussion of the wild polysemy of multiculturalism, the idea, they argue, is useful because it can be made to insist on a ‘constitutive heterogeneity’ (2008 : 3) that refuses the foundational constructions of a national ethnos. The converse is equally plausible; much of the scattergun opprobrium directed at and through the idea of multiculturalism is a consequence of its pronounced sense of imposition, an unwelcome and unasked for amendment to a pre-existing monoculturalism. For this reason, ‘the very idea of <b>multiculturalism,</b> the <b>ideology,</b> disturbs out of proportion to what in fact it may be’ (Elliot and Lemert 2006 : 137) ...|$|R

This raises the demand to move beyond the separatist understanding of culture and to start researching transcultural media practices such as cinema in order to find ways for pushing forward transcultural thinking in opposition to prevailing right-wing sentiments in Europe. The central aim of this thesis is to discover the reflection which transculturality leaves on the cultural content created nowadays and {{to see if there is}} any demonstrated awareness about it. Hence, the research question asks how does a spectator react to a film, categorized as transcultural. For this, the interpretation of three previously selected films is analysed within the framework of the concepts identity, space and memory, relying on Stuart Hall's reception theory. Although encodings do not necessarily follow from decodings, this thesis recognises films' potential to compel the spectator to imagine space beyond the borders of a nation state, culture and territory. In an effort to build on that and to identify opportunities for sustaining transcultural diversities through cinema, this thesis recommends the realisation of a Transcultural Film Festival. ...|$|R

Drawing from literature on multiculturalism, post civil rights colorblind racism, and family formation, I argue that perspectives on <b>multiculturalism,</b> colorblind <b>ideology,</b> and existing racial hierarchy significantly affect how prospective adoptive parents and adoption agency workers view race after the decision to create a family through transnational adoption. I first outline {{a brief history of}} transnational adoption and introduce some of the key actors that are involved in transnational adoption processes. I, then, provide an overview of demographic characteristics of families that contain adopted children from overseas by using data drawn from the 2000 U. S. Census. These analyses show that in cases where the parents??? race does not match their adopted child???s race, an overwhelming number of parents adopt Asian children. Turning to the data drawn from interviews and participant observation, I discuss how the adoption agencies educate adoptive parents in regards to how those parents build multicultural/multiracial families. I argue that presumptive notions of multiculturalism and acknowledgements of racism have influenced how adoption agencies educate adoptive parents. Finally, drawing on my interviews with adoptive parents, I examine how they internalize ideas about different racial groups. The discussion includes how adoptive parents decide to adopt transnationally as opposed to adopting domestically. I also investigate how their own perceptions of racial stereotypes and their perceptions of the communities in which they reside influence their understanding of race...|$|R

The multicultural challenge to Western logocentrism, its assertion of the implicit power structures embedded in truth claims, and the excesses of postmodern relativism are all subjected to measured criticism. Finally, the essay examines Habermas' role in postwar Germany's embrace of multiculturalism as a national platform of reinvention, and as a means to negate the trauma of the monocultural chauvinism of the Nazi era. However, Sullivan argues, it has taken cosmopolitanism too far. While post-national strategies such as Habermas' Verfassungspatriotismus are well-intentioned, they are ultimately too sterile, universalist and abstract, to satisfy a deep human need for belonging, rooted in a common cultural heritage. -/- All rights reserved.

In this discursive psychological study, we analyzed how members of the Finnish majority and different immigrant groups discussed managing ethnic and cultural diversity. As a result, four different interpretative repertoires of multiculturalism were identified. The first two repertoires normalize the hierarchical relations between immgrants and hosts. The other two repertoires questioned and criticized multiculturalism as an official policy or as everyday practices that highlight the importance of ethnic and cultural group memberships and that enable the discriminatory and essentializing treatment of immigrants. Our analysis showed that both minority and majority members can make sense of and orient towards multiculturalism in many different ways and that, contrary to the common assumption based on previous research, the viewpoints presented are not always clearly divided between the groups.

This article {{argues that}} <b>multiculturalism,</b> as an <b>ideology,</b> {{is a problem}} {{when it comes to}} {{understanding}} Islam and Muslims in contemporary Sweden. The ideology, which is built upon powerful norms that demand acceptance and tolerance of the Muslim Other, forms an ideational structure that makes Swedish scholars describe all Muslim individuals and groups in terms of Blue-and-Yellow Islam (the colors of the Swedish flag). In the article, with the help of empirical examples mainly from Sweden, it will be shown how the politically good intention to include Muslims and Islam in a new imagined community may have the consequence of silencing social processes among Muslims that would hamper integration. The notion of Blue-and-Yellow Islam has no fixed content. It is an empty signifier used in the ideological struggle of Muslims against Islamophobia. However, scholars use this category in a way that neglects the real problems for Muslims and thus they are creating a situation that has serious consequences for policymaking.

40|$|Orientada pela temática A Impossibilidade da Experiência Humana nas Determinações Sociais Contemporâneas, a presente pesquisa se dispõe a analisar a relação entre o Multiculturalismo e a Ideologia, enfocando a problemática do conceito de reconhecimento a partir da teoria de Charles Taylor sobre a formação da identidade. Ao explicitar o conceito de ideologia, a nossa pretensão é analisar e avaliar o seu estatuto ontológico nas relações inter-humanas na dinâmica das práticas multiculturais. Deste modo, a nossa pesquisa procura apreender e esclarecer a impossibilidade das experiências interpessoais compreendidas como convivências intersubjetivas seja no {{interior}} dos diversos grupos que compõem uma mesma sociedade seja nas relações interculturais entre sociedades com diferentes tradições. Por outro lado, não pretendemos que a nossa pesquisa se limite a permanecer em uma forma de ceticismo em relação à vida sociocultural das sociedades contemporâneas. Eis o motivo de a nossa pesquisa ter como finalidade desenvolver conceitos que possibilitem desenvolver um vocabulário valorativo que permita superar essa suposta impossibilidade de convivência autêntica. A nossa questão de fundo teórico está na investigação dessas formas possíveis de convivência, oriundas do multiculturalismo, que permitem uma espécie de abertura para esclarecer o tipo de linguagem produzido em nossa era. Buscamos construir uma base conceitual que possibilite a elaboração de novos modos de ser intersubjetivos. Founded on {{the theme}} The Impossibility of Human Experience in Contemporary Social Determinations, this study aims at analyzing the relationship between <b>Multiculturalism</b> and <b>Ideology,</b> focusing {{the issue of the}} concept of Recognition in Charles Taylors theory about identity formation. While exploring the concept of ideology, our intention is to analyze and evaluate its ontological usage in interpersonal relations in the dynamics of multicultural practice. This research aims therefore to grasp and clarify the impossibility of interpersonal experiences, the latter being understood as intersubjective acquaintanceship either inside different groups of a same society or in intercultural relations among societies with different traditions. On the other hand, it is not our intention that this research be limited to a frame of skepticism regarding social and cultural life of contemporary societies. Thus, this is the reason why our study has as its final purpose the development of concepts which may lead to the building up of a valorative vocabulary that allows us to overcome this hypothetical impossibility of genuine social acquaintanceship and intimacy. Our theoretical background is related to the investigation of such possible forms of social partnership and intimacy, forms which have been created by multiculturalism and which give way to a kind of opening space that might clarify the type of speech produced in our times. We also search to provide a conceptual basis that allows us to create new modes of being intersubjective human beings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{conceptual}} and theoretical {{map of the}} trajectory of relationship between religion and schooling that explains why and how religion has changed within state education policy. The concepts and theories of phases of differentiated schooling are built by applying the theoretical insight from the sociology of religion {{to the field of}} education using the case studies of Norway and New Zealand. Phases of differentiated schooling elucidates a general pattern of religious change in schooling, identifying global political, cultural and philosophical variables that have changed the concept of religion within nation state education policy using the methodological insight of historical sociology. The concepts and theories of phases of differentiated schooling are organised by a multi-level structure that allows for the identification and synthesis of these global variables, while also providing flexibility to account for national context and interpretation. Phases of differentiated schooling identifies three distinct theoretical and conceptual phases of relationship between religion and schooling. The first phase, undifferentiated schooling, has its origins in the Middle Ages where Christianity arose to form a monolithic sacred authority over western society. Because Christianity defined knowledge, beliefs and values, Churches held an almost uncontested authority and provision over schooling until the mid- 19 th century. The second phase, differentiated schooling arose from consolidations of the enlightenment, liberalism, the rise of the nation state and, the scientific revolution. These variables contributed to the progressive differentiation and secularisation of schooling. Finally, the third phase, post-differentiated schooling, reflects what sociologists have observed as the de-privatisation of religion and the desecularisation of society. Religion has changed in concept and increased in significance upon developments in <b>multiculturalism,</b> postmodernism, political <b>ideology</b> and religious education pedagogies. Consequently, from the late 20 th century religion has increased in political and public significance, reconceptualising the role of religion within state education policy. This thesis provides a means to understand the variables that determine the conceptualisation of religion within nation state education policy, thereby enhancing the ability to critically evaluate the relationship between religion and schooling...|$|R

This means that (i) individuals have to make sense of how their collective identities (e. g. ethnic, religious, national) come together and (ii) politically, multicultural societies are about equitable participation and hence inclusion, decision-making and power. The dissertation attempted to contribute to the social psychological literature on multiculturalism by looking at intergroup evaluations and also examine multiple identifications and the evaluations of (group) decision-making. The social identity approach provided the main theoretical framework from which to derive predictions. The studies were carried out in an under-researched social context of the nation as a ‘fruit salad’ (i. e. Mauritius) where multiculturalism is the predominant ideology. Mauritius is often considered as a successful polyethnic society (Eriksen, 2004). Survey data was collected among adolescent participants (age range 11 years to 19 years) of the three main ethnic groups, i. e. Hindus (n = 844), Muslims (n = 630) and Creoles (n = 310). Although the socio-historical context of Mauritius is specific, it provided a real-life equivalence to the theoretical understanding of multiculturalism. The results are thus revealing of the forms that intergroup relations can take when multiculturalism is relatively uncontested. It was found that majority and minority adolescents’ attitudes and views on the different measures were functionally similar: preferred dual identity, positive role of national identification, positive associations between national and ethnic/religious group identifications and public and private domain distinctions. Participants reported greater social distance towards out-groups in the private compared to public domain. A multiculturalism context does not necessarily means ‘group thinking’ on all grounds because across participants, representative democracy was judged as fairer than decision-making procedures that involved group considerations. That cultural groups should be recognised and respected is one thing, but that decisions should be made on a group basis is another matter. The results indicated the primacy for the adolescents of their ethnic and religious identities but these were not to the detriment of their identification with the nation. However, the findings also showed that a ‘cultural diversity’ representation of the nation does not rule out the tendency for in-group projection in terms of prototypicality and indispensability with the related unfavorable consequences for intergroup relations. It seems that in a ‘rainbow’ or ‘fruit salad’ national narrative, all components can claim to be indispensable, can view their sub-group and national identities as compatible and accept that diversity {{is part and parcel of}} public life as long as one knows where to belong...|$|R
40|$|This book (256 pages, {{written in}} Korean) is a {{critical}} essay that reviews, questions, and criticises Korean and Eastern immigrants’ thinking and behaviour styles in Australia from their cultural perspectives, and discuss and proposes a creative cultural dimension for their better life in a multicultural context. Multiculturalism is not supportive of Eastern cultures because of individualistic collection of cultures, while transculturalism facilitates nurture of their culture in a community-oriented way within multicultural circumstances. Korean and Eastern immigrants, sharing oriental cultural systems and values, should approach to the Australian multicultural context with transculturalism which allows creating new cultural values in collaboration with and by participation into local communities. [...] Many Eastern immigrants live in their own ethnic communities without or less interacting with Australian (communities). The author defines this phenomenon as “reverse immigration”. Reverse immigration refers to re-immigrating to their ethnic community in Australia or to their birth country despite they did not anticipate that this would happen to them before immigration to Australia. The author argues that Easterners’ collectivistic culture often devalues individuality and vice versa. Cultural clash between West and East often forces the immigrants to choose reverse immigration because of their {{lack of understanding of}} Western culture and their cultural characteristics such as low individuality, high power distance, and high uncertainty avoidance. For example, a vague boundary between individualist and collectivist in a collectivistic context (within their ethnic group) often leads to maladjustment to local communities and enhancement of cultural conservatism. The author proposes that the cultural clash can be overcome by cross-cultural activities named “transculturalism”. To Eastern immigrants, transculturalism can be achieved by acculturation of their two predominant cultures, the third-person perspective and generalised others. In a multicultural context, the former refers to the ability to share another person's feelings and emotions as if they were your own, and the latter does the ability to manage community and public expectations. When both cultural values are used for quality interactions between East and West, they allow Eastern immigrants to be more creative and critical and Australian to be more socially inclusive and culturally tolerant. With these discussions, the author discusses cultural differences throughout the book with four topics (chapters) and proposes transculturalism as a solution to the reverse immigration. [...] Chapter 1 criticises Koreans’ attitudes and methods towards learning English that is less pragmatic and practical, but more likely to be a scholarly study. The author explains that Koreans’ non-pragmatic towards learning English has been firmly built based on their traditional systems and values that Koreans view English as a discipline and an aim of academic achievements rather than a means of communication. Within their cultural context, English can be perceived as more than a language, but something like vastly superior to their language and culture. Their collectivistic culture regards English as an unreachable and heterogeneous one that may threaten their cultural identity, so that “scholarly studying” is only the way to achieve (not learn) it. This discourages the immigrants to engage and involve in daily dialogues by “using” English as a second language. The author further advises the readers to be aware of Eastern collectivistic culture in communication and interaction that sometimes completely reverses private and public topics in a Western context. This leads them to feel that they have no content to talk to natives. [...] Chapter 2 compares between Korea and Australia in terms of their educational systems and values, and proposes how Eastern overseas students can achieve critical and creative thinking within a Western educational setting. Interestingly, this chapter includes an explanation of why Eastern overseas students easily fail assessments including essay writing, oral presentations and discussions. One of the reasons the author explains is that Eastern students are not familiar to criticise others and think creatively, especially when they recognise that their words and ideas may harm the collectivistic harmony. Western educational systems focuses on enhancement of individuality such as self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-expression, while Eastern educational systems foster group-oriented values such as interpersonal relationship, and strong moral and spiritual values. Yet, the author argues that the collectivistic approach to criticism and creativity is often more critical and creative than Western individuals when they know what they are supposed to do for a group (or a community). Therefore, Eastern students need to think their cultural merits and demerits by using an individual perspective rather than generalised others’ perspective. The latter often discourages individual participation in a community, and the generalised others in a Western culture is weaker than Eastern. Furthermore, Western educational systems do not educate students to transform (loose) their individuality to fit into a group or a community. Rather they cultivate individuality for community prosperity. [...] Chapter 3 introduces various cases of reverse immigration in workplaces that many immigrants return to their country or their ethnic community after many trials for acculturation. Reverse immigration is unexpected and not planned before immigration, so that its emotional embarrassment increases such severe social loneliness. Most Eastern immigrant workers have tried to adjust themselves in this new cultural environment at the early stages of immigration. However, their cultural features of collectivism, high power distance, high uncertainty avoidance, and long-term oriented cultures suppress individual initiative and eliminate the space for experiments in ways of acculturation. The author argues that returning to their ethnic community (physically and psychologically) leads to two significant problems: their distorted parenting and becoming more conservatives. The former leads the first generation of immigrants to pressure their children to pursue extrinsic or materialist values, such as financial success, fame and physical appearance, rather than on intrinsic values, while the latter refers to their isolated conservative characters because of their remoteness from the changes of their own country. The author also warns that their ethnic and religious groups actively strengthens immigrants’ social loneliness and systematically discourages immigrants’ interests and desire to be involving into local communities. The ethnic communities and leaders have not been interacting with Australian local communities and, as a result, are eager to conserve outdated cultural systems values. Even they have a tendency to weed out those people who wish to settle down within Australian local communities. They believe that those people can threaten their community’s survival and continuity. [...] Chapter 4 titled multiculturalism argues that Korean and Eastern immigrants should more precisely understand Australia as a multicultural society in a way of collaboratively creating new cultural values. The author introduces multiculturalism with its definitions and history in Australia and argues the limitations of multiculturalism from an Easterner’s perspective. With well known tragedies of the second generations of U. S. immigrants, Cho Seung-Hui, a university student, massacred 32 people on the Virginia Tech before committing suicide and Hidal Hassan, an Army psychiatrist, killed 13 people at Fort Hood and the responses of ethnic community, the author explains that their mental illness may be derived from their parents’ (or ethnic group) culturally isolated attitude and socially static viewpoint of U. S. (Western system and values). The author insists that multiculturalism may restrict Eastern immigrants’ engagement and involvement in local communities. Multiculturalism has been systematically and historically developed based on Western systems and cultural values. In other words, multiculturalism requires high self-confidence and self-esteem that Eastern immigrants less prioritise them. It has been generally known that Easterners put more weight on human relationship than Westerners, but the author claims that this is not true. Within an individualistic culture, Westerners are more interested in building person-to-person connections and relationships. While Easterners are more interested in how individuals can achieve a sense of belonging within a group and a community. Therefore, <b>multiculturalism</b> is an <b>ideology</b> which forces Eastern immigrants to discard their strong desire {{to be part of a}} group and does not give a sense of belonging. In a consequence, the author advises that Eastern immigrants should aim towards “transculturalism” which allows them to actively participate in and contribute to their multicultural community. Transculturalism does not ask Easterners to discard their cultural values, but enables them to be a collectivistic individualist (a community leader) who is capable of developing new cultural values in a more creative and productive way. Furthermore, transculturalism encourages Western Australians in a multicultural context to collaborate with ethnic minorities to build a better community...|$|R
