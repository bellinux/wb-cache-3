25|$|Flat weaving and {{embroidery}} {{were known}} during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, {{where they were}} used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries. More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution, or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the Silk Road near Turfan. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by {{the report of the}} historian Al-Tabari about the Spring of Khosrow carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{in cancer}} cells, chromothripsis has also be {{reported}} in patients with developmental and congenital defects, i.e. germ line cells. Using multiple molecular techniques of these germ line cells that have appeared to have undergone a chromothripsis like process, as {{well as in}}versions and translocations, duplications and triplications were also seen and hence increases in copy number. This {{can be attributed to}} replicative processes that involve the restoration of collapsed replication forks such as fork stalling and template switching model (FoSTeS) or microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> that it would be more appropriate to name the phenomenon 'chromoanasynthesis' which means chromosome reconstitution rather than chromothripsis. However most samples displaying chromothripsis that are analysed have low copy states and hence have paired end joining predominating repair mechanisms.|$|E

500|$|Benson {{describes}} the [...] "Fleming Sweep" [...] as taking the reader from one chapter to another using [...] "hooks" [...] {{at the end}} of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the [...] "Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot" [...] of From Russia, with Love and, though it was the longest of Fleming's novels, [...] "the Sweep <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> half as long". Kingsley Amis, who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is [...] "full of pace and conviction", while Parker identifies [...] "cracks" [...] in the plot of the novel, but believes that [...] "the action mov fast enough for the reader to skim over them".|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal played Yelena Andreevna in the Classic Stage Company's 2009 Off-Broadway {{production}} of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in New York City. The cast also included Peter Sarsgaard, Mamie Gummer, Denis Leary, and George Foreman. The production, directed by Martin Scorsese, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News {{was less than}} enthusiastic about her performance, writing: [...] "Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film Sherrybaby, plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> as if she's been in Sherry's stash." [...] However, Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant was complimentary, noting that she [...] "ultimately blossoms" [...] as the character.|$|E
500|$|At Demme's {{personal}} recommendation, Pfeiffer {{joined the}} cast of Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons (1988) alongside Glenn Close and John Malkovich, playing the virtuous victim of seduction, Madame Marie de Tourvel. Her performance won her widespread acclaim; Hal Hinson of The Washington Post saw Pfeiffer's role as [...] "the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> an aspect of her spirituality".

500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> as if they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings {{not just for the}} ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed.|$|E
500|$|The role of Mopsa was {{originally}} {{performed by a}} soprano; however, a later revision by Purcell stated that {{it was to be}} performed by [...] "Mr. Pate in woman's habit", presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight the refrain [...] "No, no, no, no, no; no kissing at all" [...] in the dialogue between Corydon and Mopsa. Also, it is not entirely clear what the word [...] "countertenor" [...] means in this context. The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell (himself a countertenor) used a tenor with a particularly high range (though lighter at the top) and tessitura (known sometimes as a haute-contre, the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony) or a falsettist. It seems that throughout his career he used both. [...] However, purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude, it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist, and the presence of a duet for two male altos ("Let the fifes and the clarions") <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> more probable that for this work falsettists were employed.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Ben Williams of New York cited the album's first five tracks, {{including}} [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound", as updating the early 1980s Minneapolis sound: [...] "tense drum machines, high-pitched synth squiggles and staccato funk bass lines". While reviewing the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the first three songs of the album include the word [...] "sex" [...] in their titles, [...] "as if mere repetition of the word will magically conjure a sex vibe, when in truth it has the opposite effect: it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> that Justin is singing about it because he's not getting it." [...] Lucy Davies of BBC Music stated that it is initially [...] "difficult {{to listen to the}} lyrics of the opening tracks and give an objective opinion". She wrote that it is like Timberlake is [...] "trying to find redeemable qualities about some guy who has zero social skills and stares at women on his own from the corner of a bar. Only he seems to have found some similarly unreconstructed creepy friends shouting words of encouragement to his clunky chat-up lines, like Timbaland".|$|E

500|$|Songs of Innocence {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for [...] "aim for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 [...] "sounded as impersonal as ever" [...] {{and that the}} album was [...] "flat and strangely complacent", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was [...] "treading old ground without much {{of a sense of}} how to move forward." [...] Ben Patashnik of NME said only [...] "Iris", [...] "Song for Someone", and [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] were [...] "standouts", and he criticised the release strategy, judging [...] "the fact it's free <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> cheap." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was [...] "otherwise marred by the kind of slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: [...] "They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to be everything to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've wound up with a record that appeals to a narrow audience".|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the content}} of the poem, and some felt that it fell short of what was necessary to make it truly great. In 1930, William Empson, while praising the form of the poem as universal, argued against its merits because of its potential political message. He claimed that the poem [...] "as the context makes clear", means that [...] "18th-century England had no scholarship system of carriere ouverte aux talents. This is stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities." [...] He continued: [...] "the truism of the reflection in the churchyard, the universality and impersonality this gives to the style, claim as if by comparison that we ought to accept the injustice of society as we do the inevitability of death." [...] T. S. Eliot’s 1932 collection of essays contained a comparison of the elegy to the sentiment found in metaphysical poetry: [...] "The feeling, the sensibility, expressed in the Country Churchyard (to say nothing of Tennyson and Browning) is cruder than that in the Coy Mistress." [...] Later, in 1947, Cleanth Brooks pointed out that [...] "In Gray's poem, the imagery does seem to be intrinsically poetic; the theme, true; the 'statement', free from ambiguity, and free from irony." [...] After describing various aspects and complexities within the poem, Brooks provided his view on the poem's conclusion: [...] "the reader may not be altogether convinced, as I am not altogether convinced, that the epitaph with which the poem closes is adequate. But surely its intended function is clear, and it is a necessary function if the poem is to have a structure and is not to be considered merely a loose collection of poetic passages." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Edelstein of New York {{wrote that}} the film overstates the {{importance}} of its basis, the Frost interviews, stating it [...] "elevates the 1977 interviews Nixon gave (or, rather, sold, for an unheard-of $600,000) to British TV personality David Frost into a momentous event {{in the history of}} politics and media." [...] Edelstein also noted that [...] "with selective editing, Morgan <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> as if Frost got Nixon to admit more than he actually did."

Jackson also shortens the Council of Elrond by spreading its exposition into earlier parts of the film. Elrond's counsellor, Erestor—who suggested the Ring be given to Tom Bombadil—was completely absent from this scene. Gimli's father, Glóin, was also deemed unnecessary. [...] In addition, the movie <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> by chance that the Fellowship is made of nine companions, whereas in the book Elrond suggests there be nine in the fellowship {{in response to the}} nine Nazgûl.|$|E
2500|$|In the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington {{declared}} the film a masterpiece, lauding it as [...] "provocatively conceived, gorgeously shot and masterfully executed [...] Kubrick's brilliantly choreographed one-take scenes create a near-hypnotic atmosphere of commingled desire and dread." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was also highly positive, arguing that [...] "the film's primal, almost religious intensity and power is primarily derived from its multifaceted realization that disobeying {{the dictates of}} society and your conscience can be both terrifying and exhilarating. [...] The film's depiction of sexual depravity and amorality could easily venture {{into the realm of}} camp {{in the hands of a}} lesser filmmaker, but Kubrick depicts primal evil in a way that somehow <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> both new and deeply terrifying." ...|$|E

2500|$|In many ways, {{the book}} is fairly typical for a Regency romance, in that it focuses heavily on manners and {{societal}} expectations.
