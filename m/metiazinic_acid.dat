40|$|In a {{double-blind}} {{cross-over study}} the analgesic and anti-inflammatory action of Ibuprofen ffX> mgjday {{in cases of}} rheumatoid arthritis has been compared with aspirin 4 g/day, <b>metiazinic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 Â· 5 gl day and a placebo, lactose. Each compound was adpiinistered in identical capsules and in a totally randomised order to all patients studied. Assessment of the articular index, grip strength, knee score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and subjective improvement was made before and after one week's treatment with each drug. In the doses used in this trial, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of <b>metiazinic</b> <b>acid</b> in rheumatoid arthritis, {{was found to be}} approximately equipotent to that of aspirin, while Ibuprofen seemed to be slightly more potent and to cause fewer side-effects...|$|E
40|$|While {{participating}} in a clinical trial of suprofen, a new antiphlogistic agent, a 32 -year-old atopic woman developed a severe contact dermatitis reaction of the hands to this substance. To check for cross-reactivity patterns, patch tests were performed with similar arylalcanoic acid derivatives. Positive reactions were obtained for ibuprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, naproxen, alclofenac, and <b>metiazinic</b> <b>acid,</b> which are all antiphlogistic and anti-inflammatory agents for systemic use, and chlorambucil, which is an antineoplastic agent. The antigenic determinant seems to correspond to a very well-defined structure: the carboxyl group (-COOH) has {{to be separated from}} the aryl structure by at least one C atom (substituted or not). Furthermore, the aryl group must be substituted with different chemical groups but not in the orthopositions. status: publishe...|$|E
