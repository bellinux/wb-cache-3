It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of <b>my</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> He was still saying it in May.

Kate-Michelle attended St Columba’s High School (Springwood), Andrea attended the Good Samaritan Catholic College (Hinchinbrook), while William attended St Mary’s Cathedral College (Sydney). Andrea said she felt honored to be rewarded for all her hard work leading up to starting university. “Not only did I gain self satisfaction when I received the scholarship, as I felt that all my hard work and commitment in <b>my</b> <b>senior</b> <b>years</b> of school had been rewarded, but I also felt appreciative to the University for their acknowledgement of my success in my ATAR results. ”Kate-Michelle, who is studying a Bachelor of Marketing and Public Relations, said receiving the Scholarship was an added bonus to starting her first year at Notre Dame. “I always knew I would be coming to Notre Dame, the idea of undertaking a double major really appealed to me and I love the friendly atmosphere every time I walk on Campus. “Being awarded a Merit Scholarship has made my first semester at university all that more exciting. The fact that I now don’t have to worry about my first year of fees has definitely helped with my transition to university life. ”Manager of the Admission and Prospective Students Office, Demelza Haines, congratulated the recipients on their wonderful achievement. “At Notre Dame it is fantastic to see young, bright and energetic people enter degrees and working towards accomplishing their dream in their chosen future profession.
