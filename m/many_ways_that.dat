5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the show}} was planned to include a new [...] "murder mystery" [...] each week, {{at the same time}} having a {{comprehensive}} storyline. So Carter created the idea of the new millennium, which could give the show its own [...] "feel". He felt he [...] "could capitalise" [...] {{and at the same time}} have a new murder mystery every week with a [...] "millennial" [...] twist to it. He also wanted to explore [...] "evil", not the [...] "scientific approach" [...] which was the psychological explanation of [...] "evil". Carter wanted to explore evil through an [...] "unscientific approach", an exploration where [...] "the Bible" [...] played an important role. While clearly stating that {{the show was}} not supposed to be heavily grounded in religious text, he felt in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the Bible explained [...] "things on various levels" [...] and [...] "not just in the modern scientific way." ...|$|E
500|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} to the United States were met with considerable distrust, resentment, and discrimination almost {{from the time of}} their first arrival. [...] Many politicians argued that the Chinese were so different in so <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> they not only would never (or even could) assimilate into American culture, but that they represented a threat to the country's principles and institutions. [...] In this climate of popular anti-Chinese sentiment, Congress in 1882 enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which placed limits on Chinese immigration to the United States. [...] (The original Chinese Exclusion Act was amended several times—such as by the 1888 Scott Act and the 1892 Geary Act—and as a result it is sometimes referred to in the plural as the [...] "Chinese Exclusion Acts".) [...] Chinese already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization and, if they left the U.S. and later wished to return, they needed to apply anew and obtain approval again. Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the United States {{under the terms of the}} law.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga began the performance wearing a square-shaped head piece and an all-white cape as pre-recorded boos were quickly replaced by sound of cheers. Gaga then glided across the stage and was assisted by her dancers as she changed into a black sequin leotard and performed the intricate choreography seen in the song's corresponding music video. Throughout the performance she cycled through costumes and wigs she had previously employed throughout her career. She was also dancing with a Jeff Koons blue gazing ball, and had her face painted in the style of the single cover by one of her dancers. She concluded the performance by emerging from behind jungle-like scenery dressed in a seashell bikini ensemble, wearing a bigb londe curly wig and taking a bow. Gaga collaborated with experimental theater director Robert Wilson on the performance. His designed set featured a shimmering white jungle background with letters spelling [...] "Applause" [...] suspended from tree branches. Gaga characterized the performance as: [...] "So beautiful, it is so indicative of me as an artist. I feel in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the performance is like a giant metaphor for me." [...] She also commented that the production was [...] "the most physically challenging performance I've done, ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> {{the soil}} food web is an {{integral}} part of landscape processes. Soil organisms decompose organic compounds, including manure, plant residues, and pesticides, preventing them from entering water and becoming pollutants. [...] They sequester nitrogen and other nutrients that might otherwise enter groundwater, and they fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, making it available to plants. [...] Many organisms enhance soil aggregation and porosity, thus increasing infiltration and reducing surface runoff. [...] Soil organisms prey on crop pests and are food for above-ground animals.|$|E
2500|$|With {{cartilage}} piercing, {{the blunt}} force of an ear piercing instrument will traumatize the cartilage, and therefore make healing more difficult. [...] Also, {{because there is}} substantially less blood flow in ear cartilage than in the earlobe, infection {{is a much more}} serious issue. [...] There have been several documented cases of severe infections of the upper ear following piercing with an ear piercing instrument, which required courses of antibiotics to clear up. There are <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> an infection can occur: the most common way is when the person that got pierced decides to take out the piercing too early. According to the A.M.A, [...] the proper waiting period to change or take out a piercing with substantially less risk of infection would be three weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Organizational {{rewards and}} job {{conditions}} play {{a large role}} in perceived organizational support as well. [...] Sometimes, extrinsic motivation can mean more to an employee than intrinsic motivation because perceived appreciation has the power to turn a bitter employee into a content employee. [...] Eisenberger and Rhoades discuss the <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> employers can show appreciation and reward their employees. [...] A few examples are paying their employees fairly; recognizing their employees for new ideas, exceptional work, etc.; promoting their employees when they deserve it; providing job security as incentive to remain with the organization; encouraging autonomy to correspondingly increase production and morale; reduce stress when made aware of it; and to provide proper training, to ensure employees' confidence in their jobs. [...] Some of these factors carry less weight than others do. [...] Being autonomous increases an employee's desire to continue to remain loyal to his or her organization because if he feels competent and confident in his ability to do well, he will be less likely to give up or lose faith.|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E
2500|$|Bond began A String in the Harp {{while looking}} for a job after {{returning}} to the United States from a year in graduate school studying librarianship in Aberystwyth. She drew closely on her experiences and reactions to write the book, saying [...] "the American family notices and adjusts to the same things I did". She did not intend to write a fantasy. [...] "I consider myself a realistic kind of person, and it really surprised me in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the first book I should write would be a fantasy." [...] According to Elizabeth Briggs in On the Inside Looking In: Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Fantasy, non-Welsh authors use Welsh mythology in their books to develop a sense of fantasy and unreality. But Bond found using Taliesin's life was a good way to introduce Welsh history into the story. Because he was already associated with the area she was writing about and his presence helped convey a sense of the country's age to her American reading audience, she chose to use him as her link to Wales' past. She needed a talisman to trigger the fantasy sections of the story, and when she read that harp keys are essential for tuning she knew she had found an object she could use in the book. The visions the key brings to Peter and the others tie the various elements of the story together.|$|E
