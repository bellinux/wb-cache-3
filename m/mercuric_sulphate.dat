40|$|If the parenchymal {{cells of}} the liver of the rat, or certain other cells, are stained with a {{modified}} Mallory stain or with iron haematoxylin, the nuclei are stained in two different ways. This effect may be observed after various fixatives. Direct microscopical observation shows that when part of a nucleus is cut away by the microtome-knife, the part of it remaining in the section stains differently from an intact nucleus. The probability of a nucleus being wholly or only partly contained in a section of a particular thickness can be calculated. Counts made in sections of various thicknesses show {{that the proportion of}} nuclei stained in the different ways is consistent with the calculated probability. It is suggested that the nuclear membrane in the fixed state presents a relatively low permeability. SHEININ and Davenport (1931) observed in liver cells two types of nuclei that may be distinguished by differential staining. This result was obtained after fixation of the tissue in a complex mixture containing potassium dichromate, sodium sulphate, <b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphate,</b> sulphuric acid, and aceti...|$|E
40|$|Sections {{of tissue}} {{embedded}} in collodion are heated in an acidified aqueous solution of <b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphate</b> and sodium nitrite. A red colour denotes {{the presence of}} phenols (generally the tyrosine of proteins). The reagent is more rational than Millon's {{and most of the}} modifications of his method used up till now in histochemistry. It gives a particularly strong coloration. THE purpose of the work described here was to find a test for phenols thatwould be more sensitive, dependable, and rational than Millon's (1849) and the various modifications of his method that have already been introduced into histochemistry. Of these, the test of Bensley and Gersh (1933) is probably the most often used; but it was used by them for frozen-dried tissues, and it generally gives a feeble colour with sections of fixed material. It was shown by Meyer (1864) that a red colour is produced when tyrosine is treated with mercuric chloride in the presence of potassium nitrite in acid solution. Millon's test depends in reality on a similar reaction, nitrite being formed in the preparation of the reagent. The various authors who have introduced tests resembling Meyer's to replace Millon's have all used sodium or potasium nitrite, but they have worked with different salts o...|$|E
40|$|Objective: An {{increasing}} numbers of cases of poisonings by glimepiride, either attempted suicide or accidental, combined with the absence of reliable methods for the detection and quantitation of glimepiride in biological matrices {{is the basis for}} the need for the development of new analytical techniques for forensic analysis. Materials and Methods: Analyses were performed using drug- free biological fluids (whole blood and urine). Specimens were spiked with chromatographically pure glimepiride. After hydrolysis with diluted hydrochloric acid at 50 - 60 °C for 15 - 20 min and a double extraction into chloroform, glimepiride was identified by thin-layer chromatography. Standard solution of glimepiride (1 mg/mL) and Sorbfil chromatographic plates were used for thin-layer chromatography. The thin-layer chromatography studies showed that the best mobile phase was chloroform:acetone (9 : 1), Rf value of glimepiride in five examinations was 0. 37 ± 0. 02. Visualization of glimepiride was achieved byspraying with Dragendorff’s, Bushard’s, or diphenylcarbazone-chloroform solution followed by <b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The limit of detection of pure glimepiride by thin-layer chromatography was 0. 5 p/mL, 1. 5 p g/mL in whole blood and 1. 0 p g/mL in urine. For spectrophotometric determinations of glimepiride, a UV/VIS spectrophotometer with 1 cm matches quartz cell was used. Standard solutions of glimepiride in ethanol were prepared at concentrations of 1 - 50 p g/mL and scanned in full-scan mode between 200 - 400 nm. Results and Conclusion: The wavelength maxima for glimepiride was found to be 227 nm with molar absorptivity of 3. 2685 x 10 4 l/mol/cm. Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 2 - 40 p g/mL. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be 0. 97 p g/mL and 2. 70 p g/mL, respectively. The results have been successfully applied in blood of patients after oral administration and on postmortem blood in an overdose death.

40|$|Abstract- Exo-polysaccharides like dextran {{produced}} by Weissella sp. {{have a wide}} range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical and other industries. This biopolymer and its derivatives like iron dextran, clinical dextran are rapidly emerging as a new and industrially important products. Dextran a polymer of glucose is produced using sucrose rich media with nitrogen source. It also requires efficient micronutrients and macronutrients for production. In the present study diverse micronutrients (chlorides) like ferric chloride, cupric chloride, magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, calcium chloride, cobalt chloride, <b>mercuric</b> chloride (<b>sulphates)</b> like ferrous sulphate, copper sulphate, magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate, calcium sulphate, potassium hydrogen sulphate and macronutrients (phosphate) like dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, calcium phosphate, aluminium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and zinc phosphate were screened using statistical design like Plackett-Burman. An eight experimental design of Plackett-Burman was used and seven sources were screened. Broth analysis indicated presence of more fructose and very less glucose as it was used for exopolysccharide production. Dextran was recovered from broth by alcohol precipitation. The results indicated that there was higher dextran production in chloride micronutrients like magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, sulphate micronutrients like magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate and macronutrient like dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. These studies indicate that micronutrients and macronutrients significantly influence dextran production. These should be included in optimized production media for commercial production of dextran...|$|R
40|$|Análise bacteriológica de ordem qualitativa foi desenvolvida em duas estações de tratamento de esgoto da cidade do Rio de Janeiro no período de 1984 a 1985. A pesquisa considerou o isolamento e a identificação de 540 culturas de Escherichia coli, advindas de afluentes e efluentes. Estudou-se a resistência a oito antimicrobianos (sulfadiazina, estreptomicina, tetraciclina, cloranfenicol, canamicina, ampicilina, ácido nalidíxico e gentamicina) e a três metais pesados (sulfato de cobre, cloreto de mercúrio e sulfato de zinco), além da colicinogenia. Foi possivel a detecção de percentuais até 95 para culturas isoladas dos efluentes com marcadores genéticos, contrapondo-se com taxas ao redor de 70 % para aquelas provindas dos afluentes. Qualitative {{bacteriological}} {{analysis was}} carried out in two sewage treatment plants in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the period 1984 - 1985. Specific points of the plants were selected for the collection of affluent and effluent samples. The study involved the isolation and the identification of 540 cultures of Escherichia coli that were analyzed for their resistance to eight antibiotics (sulfadiazine, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid and gentamycin), and three heavy metals (copper <b>sulphate,</b> <b>mercuric</b> chloride and zinc sulphate) as well as colicinogeny. About 95 % of the isolated cultures from the effluents had genetic markers while the samples originated from the affluents showed 70 %...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with {{acute renal failure}} of diverse aetiology showed myoglobinuria and elevated levels of serum creatine phosphokinase (mean 119 · 2 Sigma u. /ml) and adolase (mean 88 · 5 Sibley-Lehninger (SL) u. /ml), indicating the presence of diffuse muscle cell injury. The primary conditions which led to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure were burns, eclampsia, prolonged labour, crush injury, epileptiform convulsions, status asthmaticus, viral myositis and intoxication with chemicals including copper <b>sulphate,</b> <b>mercuric</b> chloride and zinc phosphide. In 10 non-myoglobinuric {{patients with}} acute renal failure, serum creatine phosphokinase was normal (mean 8 · 9 Sigma u. /ml) and serum aldolase was only slightly elevated (mean 11 · 2 SL u. /ml). Although uric acid was elevated in both groups, the values were significantly higher in myoglobinuric (mean 0 · 728 ± 0 · 199 mmol/l) compared to non-myoglobinuric patients (mean 0 · 583 ± 0 · 093 mmol/l). During the oliguric phase, hypocalcaemia was observed in 82 · 2 % of myoglobinuric patients and in 20 % of non-myoglobinuric patients. Ten out of 15 patients with myoglobinuric renal failure developed hypercalcaemia during the diuretic phase whereas only 3 non-myoglobinuric patients showed a transient hypercalcaemia. Although the mean serum potassium was somewhat higher in the myoglobinuric patients, {{the difference between the}} 2 groups was not significant. It is concluded that acute renal failure associated with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis is not infrequent and may occur in a variety of conditions where gross evidence of muscle injury is lacking...|$|R
