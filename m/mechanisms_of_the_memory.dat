40|$|Memory-based messaging, passing {{messages}} between programs using shared memory, is {{a recognized}} technique for efficient communication that {{takes advantage of}} memory system performance. However, the conventional operating system support for this approach is inefficient, especially for large-scale multiprocessor interconnects, and is too complex to effectively support in hardware. This paper describes hardware and software optimizations for memory-based messaging that efficiently exploit the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> system to provide superior communication performance. We describe the overall model of optimized memory-based messaging, its implementation in an operating system kernel and hardware support for this approach in a scalable multiprocessor architecture. The optimizations include address-valued signals, message-oriented memory consistency and automatic signaling on write. Performance evaluations show these extensions provide a three-to-five-fold improvement in communication perfo [...] ...|$|E
30|$|For more {{understanding}} of the conduction and switching <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> device, the I-V characteristics are replotted in a log-log scale. Figure  3 b shows the logarithmic plot of the previous I-V curve for the positive voltage sweep region, while it is similar for the negative branch. The I-V curve in LRS clearly shows an ohmic behaviour, which {{might be due to}} the formation of conductive filaments in the device during the set process. However, the conduction mechanism in off state is much more complicated. The charge transportation in this region is in agreement to the classical trap-controlled space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC), which consists of three regions: the ohmic region (I ∝ V), the Child's law region (I ∝ V 2) and the steep current increase region [25]. The totally different conduction behaviours in these two states (LRS and HRS) also suggest that the high conductivity in on-state device should be a confined, filamentary effect rather than a homogenously distributed one. This indicates the fact that the active medium is much smaller than the device size, providing a potential of scaling.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{strengths}} and weaknesses of cognitive psychopathology through the specific examples of the memory impairments associated with the administration of benzodiazepines, with schizophrenia, and with depression. Method: These examples are analyzed with reference to a model of memory based on the principle of division between specialized and central processing structures. A basic contention is that it is useful to consider 2 broad classes of processes—automatic, associative, or sensory/perceptual processes on the one hand and intentional, strategic, or reflective processes on the other hand—as being separate. Results: The functional <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> impairments associated with these conditions are beginning to be identified, and there is preliminary evidence that a deficit in an elementary computation may have dramatic consequences on highest cognitive functions. There is also evidence that certain memory impairments are linked to specific dysfunctional outcomes in everyday life. By showing that specific rate-limiting factors of cognitive performance can be identified and are amenable to cognitive interventions, existing data open the door for theoretically and empirically based cognitive remediation of mental disorders. Conclusion: The bulk of available evidence (albeit limited) makes the enterprise of cognitive psychopathology quite plausible and convincing.

Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> in <b>the</b> same page will be wasted if the security-critical data only occupies a few bytes, such as rule →deny in Listing 1. The second challenge is that accessing <b>the</b> isolated <b>memory</b> region requires time-consuming processor mode switching operations, such as changing page permissions or entering the enclave. What is worse, when a whole data structure {{is placed in the}} secure region, accessing the non-secure-critical data in that data structure also requires a mode switching.|$|R
40|$|Nonvolatile organic {{memory devices}} were {{fabricated}} utilizing a graphene oxide (GO) layer embedded between two polystyrene (PS) layers. Scanning electron microscope images of GO sheets sandwiched between two PS layers {{showed that the}} GO sheets were clearly embedded in the PS layers. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Al/PS/GO/PS/n-type Si devices clearly showed hysteresis behaviors with multilevel characteristics. <b>The</b> window margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonvolatile <b>memory</b> devices increased from 1 to 7 V with increasing applied sweep voltages from 6 to 32 V. <b>The</b> cycling retention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ON/OFF switching for the devices was measured by applying voltages between + 15 and - 15 V. While <b>the</b> capacitance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> devices at an ON state have retained as 230 pF up to 10 (4) cycles, that at an OFF state maintained as 16 pF during three times <b>of</b> repeated measurements. <b>The</b> extrapolation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retention data for the devices maintained up to 10 (6) cycles. <b>The</b> operating <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonvolatile organic <b>memory</b> devices with a floating gate were described by the C-V results and the energy band diagrams.

40|$|This study {{explored}} <b>the</b> underlying <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verbal short-term <b>memory</b> {{deficit in}} Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. Twenty-four children with dyslexia and 28 age-matched normal readers {{participated in the}} study. They were required to memorize a visually presented series of six Chinese characters and identify them from a list also including code-specific distracters and non-code-specific distracters. Error rates were recorded and were higher for code-specific distracters in all three conditions, revealing phonological, visual, and semantic similarity effects respectively. Group comparisons showed a stronger phonological similarity effect in dyslexic group, suggesting intact activation of phonological representations of target characters. Children with dyslexia also exhibited a greater semantic similarity effect, revealing stronger activation of semantic representations, while visual similarity effects were equivalent to controls. These results suggest that <b>the</b> verbal short-term <b>memory</b> deficit in Chinese dyslexics might not stem from insufficient activation of phonological information. Based <b>the</b> semantic activation <b>of</b> target characters in dyslexics is greater than in controls, {{it is possible that}} <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> deficit <b>of</b> dyslexia is related with deficient inhibition of target semantic representations in short-term memory.

40|$|<b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> {{this work}} was to study the {{importance}} and regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin- and inflammation-specific homing receptors E- and P-selectin ligands on CD 4 + T cells. In contrast to in vitro data, we found no correlation between <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> these ligands and the Th 1 phenotype. Instead, E- and P-selectin dependent adhesion mechanisms are universally used by T effector cells but also by Tregs. In the same line we found also only a limited importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IL- 12 /STAT 4 signal pathway for the P-lig expression on CD 4 + Tcells in vivo. We were {{able to show that}} in cutaneous inflammation the selectin ligands are essential for the in vivo function of T effector cells but also of effector-like Tregs. For Tregs we could show {{for the first time a}} functional dichotomy between different Treg subsets in vivo which was related to the differential homing phenotype. Moreover we could provide first evidences for <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> epigenetic <b>mechanisms</b> in <b>the</b> induction <b>of</b> selectin ligands in T cells which might fixate the inflammation-specific homing phenotype. We could also show that T effector cells do indeed express P-selectin ligands continuously providing the basis for a topographic <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T cells. Altogether this work broadens the understanding about <b>the</b> regulation and <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topographic <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> CD 4 + T cells and underlines <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> a correct localization of distinct T cell subsets for their in vivo function. In the future, it will be interesting to determine <b>the</b> molecular basis <b>of</b> E- and P-Lig expression and their fixation in functionally distinct T cell subsets...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to further explore <b>the</b> basic <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episodic <b>memory</b> search process. This {{included}} looking at <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> what was encoded and retrieved and the processes behind this encoding and retrieval. Some theories in the literature suggest that the LTM is more gist-based as item-specific information is lost soon after encoding, however, other theories have demonstrated that gist-based false recognition occurs because people are not retrieving the item-specific information effectively. The transfer appropriate processing theory explains that to successfully recall required information, retrieval processes need to match those of encoding. Jacoby and colleagues describe a retrieval process that involves constraining <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> search in such a way to re-enter the encoding context in order to retrieve the sought-for information. Using their memory-for-foils paradigm, this study investigates source-constrained retrieval using pictorial stimuli. It was hypothesised that for accurate recollection in phase 3, the retrieval search process needed to match the processes that occurred during encoding and thus, as the recognition task in <b>the</b> third phase <b>of</b> this experiment is an item-specific task, more foils that were encoded in the item-specific context, rather than the gist-based context, will be recollected. The findings show a non-significant difference between the foils that were recollected, resulting in a null effect. A possible reason behind this is that the participants did not engage in gist-based processing in the conceptual condition effectively and so, all foils were being processed similarly regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase 2 condition. However, participants did illustrate that they could adjust their responses to the task requirements and there was evidence of some changing between gist-based and item-specific recollection. There was a significant difference in task-order effect which has also been found in a study by Koutstaal and Cavendish (2006) which should be explored in future research...|$|R
