Instead of a drastic change in MY 1987 {{models for the}} above MK1b upgrades, some MK1a parts continued on in early <b>MY</b> 1987 <b>cars</b> while some MK1b parts came on <b>MY</b> 1986 <b>cars</b> as options. An example is that some <b>MY</b> 1987 <b>cars</b> still retained the old [...] "flat" [...] front bumper despite having MK1b upgrades everywhere else on the <b>car.</b> Some early <b>MY</b> 1987 7-rib engines came with the earlier blue top valve cover. [...] This was also noticed in the rear sway bar removal for the MY 1986. Some <b>MY</b> 1986 <b>cars</b> have a rear sway bar, while the mounting tabs on the strut housing were either there for both sides, only one side, {{or none at all}} depending on when Toyota ran out of the older rear struts with mounting tabs as production used up parts.|$|R

25|$|George Jones famously drove a John Deere {{lawn tractor}} to {{a liquor store}} after his wife had taken away his car keys {{to keep him from}} driving drunk. The {{incident}} was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took <b>my</b> <b>car</b> keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.|$|E

The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that we all know, it could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit.

Bilal had previously worked with Glasper on the latter's 2012 album Black Radio. For the song [...] "Back to Love", Bilal originally programmed the music's drums on his Logic, but decided to record them live after bringing in other musicians at Pine Studios in Philadelphia. While recording [...] "Astray", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: [...] "I just had this feeling in my head like, 'man, I want this shit to feel big!' And when I would park <b>my</b> <b>car</b> in the parking lot, the acoustics in there made you feel like was a Catholic church with all of the sounds echoing off of everything." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first song}} on the album's track list is [...] "Migrate", a song Carey wrote and co-produced {{alongside}} Danja, and features a rap verse from T-Pain. Its melody is built on a heavy electronic beat, and incorporates whistle registers and several studio-created synthesizers into its melody. Additionally, the song features the inclusion of Auto-Tune and several vocal manipulators, which are used heavily on both Carey and T-Pain's vocals. Lyrically, the song finds the singer during a night out, migrating from several locations: from {{the car to the}} club, from the bar to the V.I.P, from the party to the after-party, and finally to the hotel. According to Brian Hiatt from VH1, she [...] "hops from <b>my</b> <b>car</b> into the club ... from the bar to VIP ... from the party to the after-party ... afterparty to hotel" [...] with T-Pain, who urges her to [...] "bounce, bounce, bounce." ...|$|E
500|$|For an offer, such as [...] "you may use <b>my</b> <b>car</b> {{whenever}} you like", {{the consequence of}} compliance [...] "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer {{of the use of}} the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with [...] "your money or your life", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.|$|E

The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, you ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road."
