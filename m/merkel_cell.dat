40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes and}} the expression of met-enkephalin immunoreactivity of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> during fetal and postnatal development were investigated in touch domes and sinus hair follicles of mice by transmission electron microscopy. In prenatal fetal mice, the <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were mainly oval in shape and had slightly lobulated nuclei. These fetal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> (14, 16, 18 d gestation) which were not innervated showed {{a large number of}} accumulated dense-core granules in their cytoplasm as compared with the innervated <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> which appeared in adult mice. No <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> could be found in d 10 and d 12 fetuses. Innervation of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> was found to increase with age. The location of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> in juvenile, adult and even old mice was very similar, cells being found mainly in the basal layer of the epithelium. Using the electron-microscopic immunogold method, met-enkephalin-like substance was consistently located in the dense-core granule region of both innervated and noninnervated <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> throughout the whole developmental stage. Interestingly, it was also found that the labelling intensity of met-enkephalin immunoreactivity was significantly higher in <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> of younger age groups than in adult and old age groups. None of the nerve terminals associated with <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were labelled. The present study supports the theory of an epidermal origin of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> followed by the trophic growth of nerve fibers induced by the peptides...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} for the neural crest origin of mammalian <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells.</b> Together with nerve terminals, <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> form slowly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors that transduce steady indentation in hairy and glabrous skin. We have determined the ontogenetic origin of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> in Wnt 1 -cre/R 26 R compound transgenic mice, in which neural crest cells are marked indelibly. <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> in whiskers and interfollicular locations express the transgene, β-galactosidase, identifying them as neural crest descendants.

40|$|Merkel cell-neurite {{complexes}} are somatosensory receptors that {{initiate the}} perception of gentle touch. The role of epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> within these complexes is disputed. To ask whether <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> are genetically programmed to be excitable cells that may participate in touch reception, we purified <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> from touch domes and used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression in <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> and other epidermal cells. We identified 362 Merkel-cell-enriched transcripts, including neuronal transcription factors, presynaptic molecules, and ion-channel subunits. Antibody staining of skin sections showed that <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> are immunoreactive for presynaptic proteins, including piccolo, Rab 3 C, vesicular glutamate transporter 2, and cholecystokinin 26 - 33. These data indicate that <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> are poised to release glutamate and neuropeptides. Finally, by using Ca 2 + imaging, we discovered that <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> have L- and P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, which {{have been shown to}} trigger vesicle release at synapses. These results demonstrate that <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> are excitable cells and suggest that they release neurotransmitters to shape touch sensitivity...|$|R
500|$|Viruses are an {{established}} cause {{of cancer in}} humans and other species. Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals). Cancer viruses come {{from a range of}} virus families, including both RNA and DNA viruses, and so there is no single type of [...] "oncovirus" [...] (an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses). The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host. Viruses accepted to cause human cancers include some genotypes of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein–Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human T-lymphotropic virus. The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus (<b>Merkel</b> <b>cell</b> polyomavirus) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called <b>Merkel</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> {{is still a}} matter of debate, {{specifically}} {{the question of whether}} they are derived from epithelial cells of the epidermis or from immigrated neural crest cells. As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17 -week-old fetus, 17 % of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14 -week-old fetus only 3. 9 % of the <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells.</b> Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7 - to 9 -week embryos, no <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> arise, between weeks 8 - 12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves...|$|R

40|$|Human scalp skins {{were treated}} with 20 mM ethylendiamine-tetraacetic acid and {{terminal}} hair follicles were extracted with the epidermis. Some terminal hair follicles were morphologically preserved well and provided opportunity to examine three-dimensional distribution of CAM 5. 2 (K 8, 52. 5 kD) reactive <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells.</b> In anagen terminal hair of the scalp numerous immunoreactive <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were distributed in the presumptive bulge area. Distinct swelling as in the bulge of human vellus hair was usually absent; however, in rare instances anagen terminal hair demonstrated unilateral prominent swelling with dense aggregation of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells.</b> In telogen hair the bulge becomes indistinguishable from the regressed end of the club hair follicle but <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> continued to be abundant. We found morphologic variation of the bulge such as formation of knoblike swellings and villous projections. Interestingly, <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were also located in these structures. Palisading stockade-like nerve endings were observed surrounding the follicular epithelium at the sebaceous gland level. <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were sparse in this follicular segment.

40|$|An {{experimental}} transplantation model using human fetal {{skin was}} applied to approach {{the question of the}} embryologic origin of human <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells.</b> Palmar and plantar skin from five fetuses, between 8 and 11 weeks of estimated gestational age (EGA), was xenografted to subcutaneous beds of nude mice. After 4 or 8 weeks of growth, biopsies were taken from these xenografts and examined for the presence of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells,</b> using immunocytochemistry with antibodies specific for simple epithelial-type cytokeratins and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as well as using electron microscopy. Skin from the same fetuses at the time of transplantation was screened in the same way. In all fetuses, no (or very scarce) epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> were detected at the transplantation time, but in all cases abundant epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> of apparent human origin were found after 4 or 8 weeks in xenograft culture. Dermal nerve fibers, as recognized by neurofilament antibodies, were scarce or essentially absent in the xenografts. These results indicate that <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> regularly develop in epidermis dissected and xenografted in an early fetal stage, although the dissection implies the interruption of the dermal nerves. The results strongly support the notion of the origin of <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> from epidermal precursor cells. The apparent absence of dermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> and dermal nerve fibers in the xenografts suggests that the presence of dermal sensory nerve fibers may be required for the dropping off of epidermal <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> into the upper dermis, which occurs in normal fetal development...|$|R

However, it has been shown that they are widely distributed in both the nervous system and peripheral tissues, including endocrine organs such as the pituitary and adrenal glands. <b>Merkel</b> <b>cells</b> are neuroendocrine cells situated in the epidermis, tactile hairs and oral mucosa, and act as mechanoreceptors.
