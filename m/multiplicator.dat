If the bilinear map A&times;A→A is reinterpreted as a linear map (i. e., morphism in the category of K-vector spaces) A&otimes;A→A (by the universal property of the tensor product), then we can view an associative algebra over K as a K-vector space A endowed with two morphisms (one of the form A&otimes;A→A and one of the form K→A) satisfying certain conditions which boil down to the algebra axioms. These two morphisms can be dualized using categorial duality by reversing all arrows in the commutative diagrams which describe the algebra axioms; this defines the structure of a coalgebra.|$|E
50|$|The {{telegraph}} {{invented by}} Baron Schilling von Canstatt in 1832 had a transmitting device {{which consisted of}} a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current. The receiving instrument consisted of six galvanometers with magnetic needles, suspended from silk threads. Both stations of Shilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the galvanometers, one served for the return current and one - for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions {{of black and white}} flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Shilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two. On 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836 the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from Nicholas I of Russia. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a 5 km experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at Peterhof and the naval base at Kronstadt. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837. Schilling {{was also one of the}} first to put into practice the idea of the binary system of signal transmission. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss, together with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber in Göttingen installed a 1200 m wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the Poggendorff-Schweigger <b>multiplicator</b> with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the galvanometer. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a commutator of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.|$|E

In the years to follow he cooperated closely with {{mathematics}} and physics professors Andreas von Baumgartner (German Wikipedia) and Andreas von Ettingshausen of the University of Vienna. He produced artificial magnets on behalf of Baumgartner {{and one of the first}} photographic apparatuses in Austria (1839) following instructions by Ettingshausen, who had worked with Daguerre. By 1844 he is referred to as a [...] "university mechanic". An announcement in a paper describes his range of products as follows: [...] "Ekling makes all sorts mathematical and physical instruments and apparatuses, air pumps with glass barrel chambers, travel barometers, goniometers, chemical and mineralogical apparatuses". His <b>multiplicator</b> was used for the analysis of mineral waters among other things and praised for its sensitivity. Ekling was granted patents for induction machines, cameras and improvements to the Bain telegraph, which were taken over by the Austrian railway. Ekling’s last invention was a [...] "Galvanic Induction Machine for Medical Purposes".His reputation as a mechanic is documented in the Austrian Law Gazette for 1850: [...] "The most recommendable mechanic in Vienna, and as regards more sophisticated optical equipment, the only one to be recommended, is Eckling." [...] Among these instruments we find the heliostat in the picture alongside. Young mechanics from Germany like Rudolph Carl Adolph Dolberg (1817-1863) and Adolph Hermann Friedrich Petri (1819-1895) were apprenticed to Ekling. Johann Leopolder, who later ran his own large Telegraph and Telephone Company was also one of his apprentices and later his foreman, until he started his own establishment in 1850.In 1860 Ekling sold his premises at 25 Erdbergstrasse to his neighbour Rudolf Ditmar who owned a rapidly expanding kerosine lamp factory.

40|$|Cellular automata (CAs) are massively {{parallel}} machines where many simple cells {{work together to}} solve a larger problem. Each cell is very simple and only interacts with its neighbouring cells. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often used to evolve them because they {{are very difficult to}} program by conventional methods. In evolvable hardware (EHW), EAs are used to evolve computer hardware designs. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are often used as a platform for implementing EHW because of their massive reconfigurability. Previous research at IDI NTNU have resulted in the construction of a virtual FPGA, better suited for EHW, implemented on an actual FPGA. The virtual FPGA is called an sblock matrix and is designed as a reconfigurable non-uniform two dimensional (2 D) CA. Each cell in the CA is called an sblock. Also implemented on the physical FPGA is a developmental system based on cellular development. This system is used to develop the sblock matrix based on a set of development rules that activate new sblocks or changes the sblocks' behaviour based on neighbouring sblocks' attributes. The implementation also supports on chip fitness evaluation, which evaluates how well the current CA is performing its intended task. The fitness evaluation is based on some transform of the CA's output data. EAs need such a fitness value for their operations, so this is useful when evolving the CA. This thesis' focus is on improving and extending the system for implementation on a newer and bigger FPGA chip with more features. There are three focus areas explored in the thesis, improving the performance of the system, extending the sblock matrix to be three dimensional (3 D), and implementing a new transform for interpreting output data from the sblock matrix as part of the fitness evaluation. The results show that the new FPGA allows for making many parts of the system at least 4 times faster, {{depending on the size of}} the sblock matrix. In the case of running the sblock matrix with fitness evaluation, the performance has been increased by at least an order of magnitude. The 3 D sblock matrix is much more expensive to implement than the 2 D one, so for implementing larger ones, the performance is scaled back down to that of the original design. The new transform of the CA's output implemented is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which require a lot of multiplication to be done. Implementing <b>multiplicators</b> on an FPGA is traditionally very expensive, however some newer FPGAs have dedicated <b>multiplicators</b> that can be taken advantage of. Implementing a highly parallel DFT using many such <b>multiplicators</b> lets the DFT be as fast as most other parts of the design without using too many additional resources...|$|R

30|$|We {{assume a}} state of {{saturation}} between 25 and 50 % for the surficial some cm of the boundary wall stone {{at the time of}} sampling. This assumption is backed e.g. by simulation results from building physics that consistently show higher pore water levels inside a wall and strongly decreasing saturation towards the surface [30, 31]. Near the surface, moisture levels strongly fluctuate in reaction to changing weather conditions [32] and as we sampled in a phase of rather dry weather, rather low saturation appears to be highly probable. Under the reasonable assumption of 50 % saturation, the PPP concentrations would have to be multiplied by the factor 8 – 25 to calculate pore water concentration (cf. Table  1). When higher or lower saturation levels are considered, the range of possible <b>multiplicators</b> is even larger. This means that the PPP method can provide semi-quantitative information on salt distribution, but no absolute amounts. In future work it would be beneficial to obtain additional information on the pore size distribution of the samples.|$|R

40|$|We give {{a survey}} of several models of {{irreducible}} complementary series representations and their limits, special representations, for the groups SU(n, 1) and SO(n, 1), including new ones. These groups, whose geometrical meaning is well known, exhaust the list of simple Lie groups for which the identity representation is not isolated {{in the space of}} irreducible unitary representations (i. e., which do not have the Kazhdan property) and hence there exist irreducible unitary representations of these groups [...] so-called "special representations" [...] for which the first cohomology of the group with coefficients in these representations is nontrivial. By technical reasons, it is more convenient to consider the groups O(n, 1) and U(n, 1). Most part of the paper is devoted to the group U(n, 1). The main emphasis is on the so-called commutative models of special and complementary series representations: in these models, the maximal unipotent subgroup is represented by <b>multiplicators</b> in the case of O(n, 1), and by the canonical model of the Heisenberg representations in the case of U(n, 1). Earlier, these models were studied only for the group SL(2,). They are especially important for realization of nonlocal representations of current groups, which will be considered elsewhere. We substantially use the "density" of the irreducible representations under study of SO(n, 1) : their restrictions to the maximal parabolic subgroup P are equivalent irreducible representations. Conversely, in order to extend an irreducible representation of P to a representation of SO(n, 1), we must additionally define only one involution. For the group U(n, 1), the situation is similar but slightly more complicated. Comment: 80 pp, 54 Reference...|$|R
