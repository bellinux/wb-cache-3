His role was {{to be available to}} be consulted by any member or former member of the security and intelligence services who had [...] "anxieties relating to the work of his or her service" [...] that it had not been possible to allay through the ordinary processes of <b>management-staff</b> <b>relations,</b> including proposals for publications.|$|E

Early in his career Eric Duckworth had spent ten years at the Glacier Metal Company {{at the time when}} the Glacier Project - a pioneering new approach to <b>management-staff</b> <b>relations</b> - was being developed there by Wilfred (later Lord) Brown, the managing director, and Elliott Jaques of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.When he joined Fulmer Eric Duckworth introduced a style of management heavily influenced by his experience of the Glacier Project. Over time this evolved into an open style with features such as a company council with representatives from all staff, regular management briefing of staff and transparent grading and pay scales against which individual staff were appraised annually. The grading system enabled parity of career progression between managers and people who focussed on developing their technical expertise.|$|E
