5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relative {{prosperity of the}} state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; {{by the time he}} left office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven to eight months. Counties were also allowed to double their school tax rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to the state Board of Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who had been denied admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with his own <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Lasker {{wanted to}} play for $5,000 a side, and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} {{reductions}} when Lasker found it difficult to raise the <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> final figure was $2,000 each, which was less than for some of Steinitz's earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth about $114,000 at 2016 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz's part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.|$|E

5|$|Michel Roux {{was born}} in Charolles, Saône-et-Loire, in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie (a {{delicatessen}} specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shop was closed {{to prevent it from}} going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was not heard from again.|$|E
5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage. Modifications {{were made to}} improve the draughting of the locomotive, incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the condenser array by pipes. No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out of <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E
5|$|Seacole {{had joined}} the Roman Catholic Church circa 1860, and {{returned}} to a Jamaica changed in her absence as it faced economic downturn. She became a prominent figure in the country. However, by 1867 she was again running short of <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seacole fund was resurrected in London, with new patrons including the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Cambridge, and many other senior military officers.

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
