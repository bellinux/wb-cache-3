5000|$|Supply availability, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "supply capacity" [...] or [...] "kVA", if represented by its measured units, is the maximum kVA power allowed for a particular supply in a particular network and is set before the supply is energised. It is a figure agreed between the consumer and the supplier (set to a level required by the consumer in almost all cases except where power distribution may be physically limited to the supply) {{at the start of}} the contract. This supply availability is charged for every month, in effect as a standing charge, despite the fact that the maximum demand recorded in the month may be lower. If the kVA supply availability figure is exceeded (breached, in effect) by the value of the measured monthly maximum demand, also in kVA for this purpose, the higher figure of kVA from the maximum demand may be charged instead of the supply capacity. The new elevated kVA charge figure (or the supplier's nearest higher capacity band figure, if capacity is only allowed in banded levels 50 kVA apart for instance) may stay as the chargeable figure for twelve months depending on the electricity distribution area. This can cause temporary unnecessary high billing, as if a penalty, if the breach was avoidable. Alternatively, the capacity charge can just return to the original availability figure in the subsequent month's bill. Determining the correct capacity figure to allow for the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> <b>required</b> for the supply can be a fine judgement if the capacity charge is to be kept to a minimum, and vigilance of maximum demand and efforts to keep the power demand lower than the agreed capacity can be required to avoid triggering a higher capacity charge during the contract.|$|E
40|$|Large {{offshore}} wind turbines (OWTs) offer an attractive renewable energy {{option for the}} coastal United States, but their support structures’ high costs remain a concern. Current OWT designs largely ignore damping from foundation-soil interactions, although small increases in damping can significantly reduce the materials cost for OWT support structures. This study examines how incorporating foundation damping into turbine models affects structural demands in a monopile-supported OWT with yaw error. Simulations in the aeroelastic code FAST model the dynamic behavior of the monopile-supported NREL 5 MW reference turbine under wind and wave loads. Structural demand and reduction of such demand is studied for {{the full range of}} yaw errors (– 180 ° to + 180 °), three levels of foundation damping, and four wind-wave combinations. Including foundation damping reduces structural demands regardless of yaw angle and wind-wave combination, although percent reductions are lowest at yaw angles with high initial demand. However, for scenarios important to the design process, incorporating foundation damping reduces structural demands by 0. 3 % to 18. 6 % (with most reductions at a few percent), depending on the scenario. This suggests that incorporating foundation damping into OWT design guidelines could moderately reduce the <b>maximum</b> structural <b>demands</b> <b>required</b> of designs, consequently lowering the cost of OWTs...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{method of}} <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> {{determination}} of a multi category bulk electrical installation at planning stage {{is done by}} using several rules of thumb, in which <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> and time at which <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> occurs cannot be estimated accurately. This incorrect <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> estimation caused for wrong transformer and backup power capacity estimation, wrong cable and switchgear selection, inefficient performance of transformer, incorrect statistics, etc. In this research, a methodology is proposed to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of multi category bulk electrical installation using its entire kVA profile. This entire kVA profile of multi category bulk electrical installation is generated through a database of kVA profiles in which averaged normalized kVA profile for each installation categories have been defined along with their electrical power loading characteristics. Multi category bulk electrical installation {{can be considered as}} a combination of several single category bulk electrical installations. Hence, to determine the entire kVA profile of a multi category bulk electrical installation, averaged normalized common kVA profiles which represent each category will be added together with multiplying them by their individual calculated <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> To compile the database of averaged normalized common kVA profiles, kVA profiles (each contains kVA values of one month logging period with 15 minute intervals) of 500 numbers of single category bulk electrical installations have been considered as the sample. The sample is preprocessed, normalized and then clustered using Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. By using square sum of error of each clusters and Knee point criterion, seventeen numbers of unique kVA pattern classes were identified. Then averaged normalized kVA profiles were derived for each pattern class and map them up with example single category bulk electrical installations and their characteristics to compile above said averaged normalized kVA profile database. Visual basic programming and Matlab software is used to execute above said research work. This proposed methodology has been verified considering a multi category electrical installation and proposed methodology can be considered as an acceptable one to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of multi category bulk electrical installations. This methodology can be further improved by compiling averaged normalized kVA profile database for each installation categories separately. Additionally, this research can be further improved as a required tool for load forecasting, demand-side management, system planning, distribution system loss estimation and better tariff design, etc...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In South Africa, {{electrical}} energy is taken for granted. The low electricity price has helped electricity intensive industries to be competitive. Unfortunately {{it has also}} prevented industries to become energy efficient. During the National Electrification Programme, more than 3. 1 million homes were supplied with electricity. This has mainly increased the peak demand for electricity supplied by Eskom. Projections show that peak demand will be higher than Eskom's current generating capacity by as early as 2007. In order to curb this growth in electricity demand, Eskom launched a Demand Side Management programme in accordance with regulations drawn up by the Department of Minerals and Energy and the National Energy Regulator. The main purpose for this programme is to reduce {{electrical energy}} usage during evening peak demand times, {{as well as to}} encourage an energy efficient society. One way of implementing this evening peak reduction is to shift the load to other times of the day. An inherent problem with this method is the possible increase of an electrical energy user's <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> Such an increase could incur additional costs to an electricity user. In order to limit this <b>maximum</b> <b>demand,</b> certain systems could be shut down when the electrical energy use {{is on the verge of}} reaching peak levels. It will be shown that rock winders are the most suitable of all the systems used on a mine to manage the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> All underground mines make use of winders to extract excavated ore. Winder motors are usually large electrical energy consumers. As such, they provide an efficient and fast means of limiting the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> It is intended to switch off winder motors whenever the overall electricity demand of the mine reaches a peak level - as long as production is not influenced. This system was successfully implemented at AngloGold Ashanti's Kopanang gold mine in South Africa. During the first month of installation, the system managed the mine's <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> at a level of 88 MVA. A calculated annual saving of R 137 000 was achieved, with a maximum potential saving of R 349 000. This research showed that rock winders can be successfully used to manage a mine's <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> It can be implemented on most deep level mines that use rock winders. Suitable sites include gold, platinum and diamond mines. Master...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{increasing}} of energy demand and its escalating cost has forced many companies and institutions looking solution for this problem. Electric customers {{have to pay}} a <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> charge in addition to the usual kWh consumption charge. The peak demand charge frequently stands {{a large portion of the}} total bill and it is based on only a period of 15 or 30 minutes registered during month/billing period. The increase of <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> due to the world economic development has created high concern from electric supply companies the need to supply that growth in the short period through the existing facilities. The aim of this research is to optimize <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of electrical energy system using distributed generation technology. The selected case study is Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. In this research on-grid Distributed Generation system (DG) has been used to achieve optimum and minimum peak demand and power cost targets. The on-grid DG was based on Hybrid Power System (HPS) which combines power generated from renewable energy sources such as (PV arrays, wind turbine) and power purchased from grid utility. Micro power optimizer software (HOMER) has been used for the optimization and simulation processes. The results indicate that the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> was reduced 16. 5 % while a potential cost savings of 14 % has been achieved.
