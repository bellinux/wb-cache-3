2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{education}} on the Tsing Yi Island was mostly private. The first public school on the island is Tsing Yi Public School, a primary school founded by villagers and businessmen on the island. In the post-World War II era, Hong Kong Government provides 9-year free education to all children from primary one to secondary three. The public school is then mainly funded by the government. Another school {{for the children of}} fishermen, Tsing Yi Fishermen's Children's Primary School, was founded by Fish <b>Marketing</b> <b>Organisation.</b> In 1977, Cheung Ching Estate, the first public housing estates on the island, {{marked the beginning of the}} new town on the island. To accommodate new schooling children, three primary schools and Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College, the first secondary school on the island, were built with the estate. [...] More schools were erected when new estates were completed. In 1999, a post-secondary college, Hong Kong Technical College (Tsing Yi), was completed and provides vocational training for all adults in Hong Kong. In the 2000s, the number of schooling children began to drop and the several schools are facing the fatal fate.|$|E

40|$|A new Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation</b> (CMO) for {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} is in place from 1 January 2008. First debate about reform was lunched in 2004 by European Commission and its publication about simplification of the Fruit and Vegetable Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation.</b> The last extensive reform in 1996 introduced modifications like {{a plan for the}} progressive reduction of support for short-term market intervention and the strengthening of structural aid to improve competitiveness in order to help producers to develop their capacity and to adapt to market demand. The most important reasons for the new reform of CMO for {{fruit and vegetables}} are imbalance in the supply and distributions chain, limited influence of the producers’ organisations, coherence with rural development aid and the questions of standards. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the regulatory framework of the European Common <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> for fruit and vegetables, reasons and aims of the reform and to compare the Croatian legislation regarding fruit and vegetables sector with the EU CMO for fruit and vegetables. The qualitative research strategy which emphasizes words rather than quantification in the collection and analysis of data and has an inductive approach to the relationship between theory and research is used to make conclusions in this paper. The conclusions about the objectives are made by studying the reference literature related to the topic of the EU Fruit and Vegetables Common <b>market</b> <b>organisation,</b> assumptions derived from the research and professional knowledge related to the topic...|$|R

40|$|Most tourism {{activities}} {{take place}} at destinations. Travellers are also spoilt by choice of available destinations. Competition for their attention is intense. The success of most tourism businesses is reliant on the competitiveness of the destination. Destination <b>Marketing</b> <b>Organisations</b> is essential reading for anyone considering a career in tourism. While it has been written primarily for students undertaking studies in tourism, travel and hospitality, the text will also {{be of interest to}} those already woking with, or within DMOs. Two themes underpin Destination <b>Marketing</b> <b>Organisations.</b> The first is the challenges of promoting multi-attributed destinations in dynamic and heterogeneous markets, and the second is the divide between tourism ‘practitioners’ and academics. Written by a former ‘practitioner’, Destination <b>Marketing</b> <b>Organisations</b> bridges industry and academia by synthesising a wealth of academic literature of practical value to DMOs. The key learning outcomes of the text are to aid the development of an understanding of the fundamental issues relating to: •	The rationale for the establishment of DMOs •	The structure, roles, goals and functions of DMOs •	The key opportunities, challenges and constraints facing DMOs •	The complexities of marketing destinations as tourism brand...|$|R
