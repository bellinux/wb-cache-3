They were families...there was a cliquish component also, {{but there}} was a real sense of belonging. If you were having problems in your personal life or if you couldn't make your rent....people would really rally together. If someone had, ie. breast cancer or something, people would set up funds.” [...] "For gay men and lesbians", wrote LGBT historians Johnson and Summers, [...] "the centrality of bars to community life has probably been truer than it has for any other community group." [...] Other San Francisco lesbian bars of the 1970s, included Peg's Place, which initially had a dress code and drew a more conservative crowd, Scott's Pitt, home to [...] "leather clad <b>motorcyle</b> women and old school dykes", Wild Side West, which started in the bohemian era of North Beach, Leonarda's, with a strong butch-femme culture, Amelia's, and A Little More, both dance clubs which drew a varied crowd.|$|E

On 11 December 1935 {{he took over the}} management of the Staatliche Museen für Tier- und Völkerkunde Dresden and from 1937 he headed the zoology department at the University of Dresden. In 1939 he worked on Anthropological Surveys on Polish War Prisoners. He published his politically motivated research in Der Biologe which was taken over by the SS-Ahnenerbe. After the war, Kummerlöwe changed his name to Kumerloeve, possibly to hide his wartime activities. His publications in the journal [...] "Papers and Reports from the State Museums for Animal Science and Ethnology in Dresden" [...] have been removed from copies in many libraries across Europe. It is thought that in these papers in 1939 and 1940, he expressed his political ideas and it is believed that, after the war, Kummerlöwe personally visited libraries and purged them of his writings. Even libraries in Moscow and Leningrad have been found to have the pages missing.|$|E

40|$|Motorcycle {{visibility}} is a {{major road}} traffic accident concern, and many road traffic collisions (RTCs) involving motorcycles are caused by a “right of way” violation. The aim of this thesis is to investigate drivers’ ability to detect and identify motorcycles when the visual scene at T-junctions is manipulated and the driver is experiencing in-car distractors. Experiments 1 - 3 investigated the effects of distracting stimuli on participants’ ability to detect motorcycles (and cars) in static visual scenes depicting T-junctions. The distractions involved speaking, listening or being asked to engage in spatial imagery. Experiments 4 and 5 used {{the same type of}} images, but increased the amount of traffic in the static visual scenes of T-junctions, and changed the task demands from detection (of any vehicle) to identification (car or motorcycle). Finally, Experiment 6 examined the role of experience in identifying vehicles by examining the performance of novice and experienced drivers in the types of task developed in Experiments 1 - 5. The accuracy and speed with which motorcycles were detected was affected by the distance at which they were depicted, this effect was exacerbated when drivers are being distracted by interactive spatial and verbal tasks (Experiments 1 - 3), and by the presence on non-target cars at the junction (Experiments 4 and 5). These manipulations had less impact when cars were the targets. Experiment 6 showed that novice drivers were especially inaccurate in detecting <b>motorcyles</b> in the distance These results may help to improve driver awareness of the conditions under which they {{are most likely to be}} prone to cause accidents involving motorcycles. They highlight some of the determinants of whether motorcycles will be identified at T-junctions, which could inform policy...|$|R

Fourty five senior high school students mentioned above were subjected to (1) Rorschach Test, (2) P-F Study, (3) Speed Anticipation Test, (4) <b>Motorcyle</b> Aptitude Test, (5) Sentence Completion Test, and (6) Group Interview. As the result of those tests, the undermentioned discoveries have been obtained. Those students who gave rise to an accident, compared {{with those who have}} never caused a motor cycle trouble, were, (1) in general, they were immature in their growth mentally and socially; (2) they were excessively sensitive to stimulations, and their frames of mind were easily changeable; (3) they were nerveless and lacking in their concentration power; (4) their physical conditions were not quite satisfactory; (5) they were the children of a family where they were excessively protected {{under the supervision of the}} mother, or they were brought up in the family where a noninterference policy was adopted...|$|E
40|$|The {{social cost}} of delinquency, {{drug use and}} injury among {{adolescents}} is extensive and highlights the need for interventions aimed at preventing such behaviour among children and adolescents. The potential benefits associated with saving one high-risk youth have been estimated {{to be a large}} as $ 2. 7 million (Cohen, 1998). High-risk adolescents engage in a number of risky traffic-related behaviours such as underage driving and <b>motorcyle</b> riding on public roads, driving or motorcycle riding after drinking, and bicycle riding after drinking or without a helmet. This paper examines whether a school-based injury prevention program implemented in several South East Queensland high schools and delivered to Grade 9 students, successfully reached adolescents classified as high-risk. Results suggest that of 391 students in intervention schools who provided baseline or follow-up data 24. 9 % (n = 88) were classified as high-risk adolescents and a further 22. 9 % (n = 81) as medium-high-risk. Of these youth, 64. 8 % of high-risk and 75. 3 % of medium-high-risk adolescents received the program and were retained to one-month follow-up. Preliminary results provide evidence that high-risk adolescent youth can be effectively engaged as participants in an injury prevention program implemented in high-schools. ...|$|E
