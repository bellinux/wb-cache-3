The methodology {{is based on}} replacing the output diode in the existing flyback converter with a controlled switch, acting as either a synchronous rectifier or a <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> switch in the corresponding power flow operation. By adding an auxiliary winding in the coupled inductor, a bi-directional switch, and a capacitor, the hard-switched design can be converted into a soft-switched one. The technique utilizes the leakage inductance in the flyback coupled inductor to achieve the ZCS of all switches in both power flow directions, leading to reduced switching losses, stresses, and electromagnetic interference. No extra active or passive voltage clamp circuits are required to suppress the voltage stress on the switches.

The <b>Main</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Control</b> Unit (MPCU) of the rudder has been a subject of intense debate and discussions and has undergone mandatory modifications {{as a result of}} some previous accident investigations.

The rudder locked up in a particular direction, and reversal of rudder to that of the commanded position (anomalous rudder movements such as un-commanded movements). These have been attributed to the secondary slide jamming with the primary slide due to contamination or adverse buildup of tolerances during manufacture.

They cover the selection and installation anti-restart devices on machine tools. They apply to workers, supervisors, and machine and shop custodians. 1. 1 Background Equipment that is dependent upon electricity for its power source will stop working when the electrical power is interrupted. Once power is restored, some equipment may restart automatically, which could present a significant hazard to workers. Equipment may likely restart automatically if The switch is left in the on or closed position. It can be restarted through a computer. It has instrumentation, such as a level switch, that will re-set itself, allowing the machine to restart once power has been restored.

The <b>main</b> idea of <b>power</b> <b>control</b> is to transmit packets {{at the appropriate}} power levels that guarantee their successful reception, {{with the objective of}} improving the network throughput or lowering the energy consumed by the transmissions. In this thesis, we focus on the study and design of <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithms for IEEE 802. 11 -based wireless ad hoc networks to reduce energy consumption per carried byte, without degrading the network throughput.

We notably show that there cannot exist a universal <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithm to improve the network performance without access to global network information which is inappropriate in ad hoc networks. We thus focus on the MAC layer point of view, where we study the correlations that exist between the required transmission power of RTS, CTS, DATA and ACK frames to guarantee a successful 4 -way handshake and propose novel <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithms that take such correlations into consideration in order to reduce energy consumption per carried byte...|$|R

The performance of the multi-objective strategy is examined for a range of wind and network conditions, and it is shown that {{for the majority of the}} scenarios, more than 92 % of the main control objective can be achieved while introducing the integrated flicker control scheme with the <b>main</b> reactive <b>power</b> <b>control</b> scheme.

To improve performance of MPS, we developed a new compact MPS with 16 -bit resolution and 20 ppm stability using four-quadrant switching schemes with 50 kHz MOSFET device. Bipolar MPS for a corrector magnet consists of one <b>main</b> <b>power</b> board, <b>control</b> <b>power</b> board, regulator board and CPU board.

A unipolar MPS for quadrupoles and solenoid magnets is composed of 4 -parallel operation of two <b>main</b> <b>power</b> boards, doubling the current output. Output of the MPS is 10 V, ± 10 A for the bipolar and 50 V, 50 A for the unipolar magnet. Beam transport line (BTL) of PAL Linac has 22 solenoid magnets, 48 quadrupole magnets, and 28 corrector magnets. MPS have been operated twelve years since {{the completion}} of PLS in 1994. Power conversion scheme of these magnet power supplies is linear regulator of SCR phase rectifier. The resolution of output current is less than 12 bit. Stability is over ± 1000 ppm(± 0. 1 %).
