25|$|It {{is thought}} that the greater rights afforded to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire {{motivated}} Christians to convert to Islam. However, {{the extent to which}} Muslims were privileged is often overestimated. The primary discrimination faced by non-Muslims was of a legal nature, as Christians and Jews were not allowed to file lawsuits or testify against Muslims in court. There were also rules of conduct imposed upon them, but there were many to whom these rules did not apply. Though <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the fact that Christian and Jewish subjects of the sultan paid a poll tax from which Muslims were exempt, Muslims were also faced with the religious zakat tax, whereas Catholics made donations to their church only on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Do Not Adjust Your Set, a tea-time children's programme, ITV offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been {{impressed}} by their work on The Frost Report and At Last the 1948 Show. Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on How To Irritate People and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at ITV until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. <b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that the}} Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.|$|E
25|$|In the 1660s Newton {{studied the}} motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's {{interest}} in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center. After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis. Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.|$|E

25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had absolutely no idea where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. <b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|From what {{is known}} of Edward's character, he could be {{impulsive}} and temperamental, as was seen by his actions against Stratford and the ministers in 1340/41. At the same time, he was well known for his clemency; Mortimer's grandson was not only absolved, but came {{to play an important}} part in the French wars, and was eventually made a Knight of the Garter. Both in his religious views and his interests, Edward was a conventional man. His favourite pursuit was the art of war and, in this, he conformed to the medieval notion of good kingship. [...] As a warrior he was so successful that one modern military historian has described him as the greatest general in English history. He seems to have been unusually devoted to his wife, Queen Philippa. <b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> Edward's sexual licentiousness, but {{there is no evidence of}} any infidelity on the king's part before Alice Perrers became his lover, and by that time the queen was already terminally ill.

500|$|<b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time {{is presented}} as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of}} the film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes. At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E

Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will [...] "greatly enjoy this disc", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: [...] "It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] music video. He concluded by stating that: [...] "Although I'm not really {{a big fan of}} her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout." [...] Beierle compared Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good to the video releases of Mariah Carey. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as [...] "very slick and promotional". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez [...] "comes through energetically" [...] and without [...] "much star-ego". In the United States, Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 50,000 units.|$|E
500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} {{evidence}} that still survives {{of the earlier}} history, manuscripts written by Newton in the 1660s show that Newton himself had, by 1669, arrived at proofs that in a circular case of planetary motion, [...] "endeavour to recede" [...] (what was later called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.

The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional gender roles, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone {{has the power to}} save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed gay love at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like choreography given to the swan corps re-interprets the archetype of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, [...] "The idea of a male swan makes complete sense to me.
