5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|The first scenes {{depicting}} Tyrion descending with Bronn {{from the}} Mountains of the Moon and encountering the clansmen were not written by Martin. Since {{they were originally}} intended {{to be part of}} episode seven, they were written by that episode's authors, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. As often happens in TV production, the scene was <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> episode to another during editing.|$|E
5|$|The {{plots of}} the unmade serials also vary. A theme of a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E

As this kind of dislocation (Unlike edge and mixed dislocations) doesn't have a unique glide plane, a pure screw segment is free to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> slip plane to another if it contains the direction of burgers vector. In face centered cubic metals dislocation can <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> {111} type plane to another and In body centered cubic metals as the slip plane is less well defined, a dislocation with b=0.5<111> can glide on {110} planes or {112} planes.

5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> to the other depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet leaves were old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with the leaves of the spindle, whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the spindle.|$|E
5|$|Carney {{was born}} in St. Joseph, Missouri and was raised and educated at {{military}} posts in the U.S. as well as abroad where his parents were stationed, including in Bad Tolz, Germany, Fort Bliss, Texas and Taipei, Taiwan. His father served in the United States Army in the early 1940s before being assigned to the Judge Advocate Generals Corps in 1948. His mother, daughter of a surgeon in St. Joseph, raised Carney and his two siblings as the family <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> military posting to another. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 and the U.S. Foreign Service sent him on a brief sabbatical to study at Cornell University from 1975 until 1976, focusing on Southeast Asian studies {{as part of his}} career.

5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{started in}} Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread {{to a number}} of cities {{throughout}} Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands had sprung up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan politics to build alliances both with the middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> area to another. They normally launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.|$|E
5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> {{house to the}} next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E
5|$|The force {{tasked with}} assaulting the fort and {{capturing}} the three bridges was formed from {{elements of the}} 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, and was named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch) after {{the leader of the}} force, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force, which had been assembled in November 1939, was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots. Although the force was composed primarily of parachutists, it was decided that the first landings by the force should be by glider. Adolf Hitler, who had taken a personal interest in the arrangements for the assault force, had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot, Hanna Reitsch, that gliders in flight were nearly silent; it was believed that, since Belgian anti-aircraft defences used sound-location arrays and not radar, {{it would be possible to}} tow gliders near to the Dutch border and then release them, achieving a surprise attack as the Belgian defenders would not be able to detect them. Fifty DFS 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by the assault force, and then a period of intensive training began. A detailed study of the fort, the bridges and the local area was made, and a replica of the area was constructed for the airborne troops to train in. Joint exercises between the parachutists and the glider pilots were carried out in the early spring of 1940, and a number of refinements made to the equipment and tactics to be used, such as barbed wire being added to the nose-skids of the gliders to reduce their landing run, and the airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives, the latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in Germany and not on fortifications in Czechoslovakia similar to Fort Eben Emael. Secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways. When exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans, the sub-units of the force were frequently renamed and <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> location to another, unit badges and insignia were removed, and the airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks or to take leave.|$|E
