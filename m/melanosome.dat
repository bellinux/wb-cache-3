5|$|Longrich's {{conclusions}} {{were supported}} {{in a paper}} first published online in the journal Nature in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized feathers of several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved melanosomes, the cells that give the feathers of modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of Sinosauropteryx, IVPPV14202. By examining <b>melanosome</b> structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence {{of light and dark}} bands of colour in the tail feathers of Sinosauropteryx. Furthermore, the team was able to compare <b>melanosome</b> types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker feathers of Sinosauropteryx were chestnut or reddish brown in colour. More research on the coloration of Sinosauropteryx reveals that it had a raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic {{examination}} of {{retinal pigment epithelium}} and skin pigment cells (melanocytes) of people affected by ocular albinism type 1 reveal the presence of characteristic macromelanosomes, even though skin appears normal. Studies from Oa1 knock-out mice reveal that these giant melanosomes appear due to abnormal growth of a single <b>melanosome</b> and not due to aggregation or fusion of many melanosomes. These melanin macroglobules are probably formed due to failure of melanosomes to separate from the ER-golgi system with the accumulation of enzymes and other secretory proteins leading to an increase organelle size. However, Incerti, et al. contradict the above theory.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{a second}} Anchiornis fossil at the Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park was {{subjected}} to a similar study that included a survey of <b>melanosome</b> shapes across all the feathers. Interestingly, {{in contrast to the}} 2010 study, only gray-black type melanosomes were found. Even when the crown feathers were examined, none of the rounder, rufous type melanosomes were seen. The scientists who conducted this second study suggested several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the different preservation of melanosomes or different investigative techniques might have influenced the results of the original study. Second, because the Beijing Museum specimen was smaller, {{it is possible that the}} rufous color was replaced as these animals aged. Third, it is possible that there were regional differences or even different species of Anchiornis which had different color patterns in their plumage.|$|E
40|$|Rab GTPases {{have been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of specific microtubule- and actin-based motor proteins. We devised an in vitro motility assay reconstituting the movement of <b>melanosomes</b> on actin bundles {{in the presence of}} ATP to investigate the role of Rab proteins in the actin-dependent movement of <b>melanosomes.</b> Using this assay, we confirmed that Rab 27 is required for the actin-dependent movement of <b>melanosomes,</b> and we showed that a second Rab protein, Rab 8, also regulates this movement. Rab 8 was partially associated with mature <b>melanosomes.</b> Expression of Rab 8 Q 67 L perturbed the cellular distribution and increased the frequency of microtubule-independent movement of <b>melanosomes</b> in vivo. Furthermore, anti-Rab 8 antibodies decreased the number of <b>melanosomes</b> moving in vitro on actin bundles, whereas <b>melanosomes</b> isolated from cells expressing Rab 8 Q 67 L exhibited 70 % more movements than wild-type <b>melanosomes.</b> Together, our observations suggest that Rab 8 is involved in regulating the actin-dependent movement of <b>melanosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>melanosomes</b> by the lysosomes {{of the mouse}} liver was studied in vitro. Mice with melanoma received intraperitoneal injections of a 14 C-amino acid mixture and 14 C-dopa separately. Radioactive mitochondria and <b>melanosomes</b> were isolated from these mouse melanomas. Digestion of the 14 C-amino acid labeled <b>melanosomes</b> and mitochondria was carried out with lysosomes isolated from the mouse liver. The progressive {{degradation of}} the protein moiety of the mitochondria was observed and also the slow but steady degradation of <b>melanosomes.</b> Digestion of 14 C-dopa labeled <b>melanosomes</b> was attempted with liver lysosomes. There was no significant amount of degradation. Melanin appears to be very resistant to lysosomal digestion in vitro. It is assumed, therefore, that in the compound <b>melanosomes,</b> the <b>melanosomes</b> can be degraded by lysosomes at the protein moiety {{but not at the}} melanin moiety...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Melanosomes</b> {{found in}} certain fish species contain {{pigments}} {{that control the}} color of the fish's scales. Molecular motors, when signaled, will either carry <b>melanosomes</b> containing pigments out to the periphery of the cell, or concentrate them at the center. The motor protein dynein is responsible for concentrating the <b>melanosomes</b> {{toward the center of the}} cell, or the [...] "minus end" [...] of microtubules. Conversely, the protein kinesin is responsible for dispersing the <b>melanosomes</b> to the periphery of the cell, and are plus end directed motors. Because the plus ends of microtubules are oriented towards the periphery, kinesin will carry <b>melanosomes</b> to the periphery. Dispersing <b>melanosomes</b> to the periphery causes the cell to appear darker; concentrating <b>melanosomes</b> towards the center will cause the cell to appear lighter color. This is how a photoprotective system works for the fish on a molecular level.|$|R
25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a <b>melanosome</b> distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} view on {{the evolution}} of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are claimed to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also {{played a role in the}} evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the Parave Anchiornis huxleyi, the features are so well preserved that the <b>melanosome</b> (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on Anchiornis could be determined. Anchiornis was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to retina and melanoma, OA1 protein product was also detected in human pigment cells like melanosomal membrane glycoprotein.

Moreover, since OA1 is an organellar GPCR, it may represent an unidentified pathway in the <b>melanosome.</b> Until recently, {{it was believed that}} the probable ligand for OA1 might be within the melanosomal lumen, maybe one of the components of the melanogenic pathway since it is so closely related to <b>melanosome</b> biogenesis.

Electron microscopic, cytochemical, genetic, and biochemical evidence all support {{the contention that}} <b>melanosomes</b> are specialized lysosomes. The relationship of <b>melanosomes</b> and lysosomes provides a framework in which to understand the pathogenesis of disorders such as the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, allows the testing of hypotheses for the trafficking of proteins to <b>melanosomes,</b> and {{has important implications for}} the chemistry of melanization and the potential pharmacologic manipulation of that process.

40|$|<b>Melanosomes</b> are {{specialized}} intracellular membrane bound organelles {{that produce}} and store melanin pigment. The composition of melanin {{and distribution of}} <b>melanosomes</b> determine the color of many mammalian tissues, including the hair, skin, and iris. However, the presence of <b>melanosomes</b> within a tissue carries potentially detrimental risks related to the cytotoxic indole–quinone intermediates produced during melanin synthesis. In order to study melanosomal molecules, including melanin and melanin-related intermediates, we have refined methods allowing spectromicroscopic analysis of purified <b>melanosomes</b> using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. Here, we present {{for the first time}} absorption data for <b>melanosomes</b> at the carbon absorption edge ranging from 284 to 290 eV. High-resolution images of <b>melanosomes</b> at discrete energies demonstrate that fully melanized mature <b>melanosomes</b> are internally non-homogeneous, suggesting the presence of an organized internal sub-structure. Spectra of purified <b>melanosomes</b> are complex, partially described by a predominating absorption band at 288. 4 eV with additional contributions from several minor bands. Differences in these spectra were detectable between samples from two strains of inbred mice known to harbor genetically determined melanosomal differences, DBA/ 2 J and C 57 BL/ 6 J, and are likely to represent signatures arising from biologically relevant and tractable phenomena...|$|R

5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of type II Griscelli syndrome {{have shown that}} Rab27 is involved in <b>melanosome</b> transport in melanocytes and in cytotoxic killing activity in cytotoxic T lymphoblasts. In melanocytes Rab27 binds the <b>melanosome.</b> The <b>melanosome</b> is transported along the microtubule. Rab27 then recruits Slac2A and myosin Va, these enzymes are essential for {{the transfer of the}} melanosomes from the microtubules to actin filaments. The melanosomes can now continue on their path towards the cell periphery. If either Rab27, Slac2A or myosin Va are absent then the melansomes remain in the perinuclear region of the cell. This disruption in pigmentation results in the hypopigmentation seen in the silvery hair colour of patients with Griscelli syndrome.|$|E
30|$|Recently {{a number}} of papers have focused on the {{modulation}} of tyrosinase activity and expressions of melanogenic enzymes to control the skin and hair pigmentation.

Several proteins, involved in the transportation of <b>melanosomes,</b> have been identified {{and a lot of the}} mechanism of the transportation has been already clarified. Therefore, the investigation of regulators on transportation of <b>melanosomes</b> is desired.|$|R
50|$|The pseudopodial process (aka the tanning process) happens {{slowly in}} dermal melanocytes in {{response}} to ultraviolet light and to production of new <b>melanosomes</b> and increased donation of <b>melanosomes</b> to adjacent keratinocytes, which are typical skin surface cells. Donation occurs when some keratinocytes engulf {{the end of the}} melanocyte pseudopodia, which contain many <b>melanosomes.</b> Cytoplasmic dynein will carry the vesicles containing the melanin {{to the center of the}} cell, which causes <b>melanosomes</b> to sequester the keratinocyte's nucleus, providing optimal protection from UV rays. These changes are responsible for tanning of human skin after exposure to UV light or sunlight.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the effects of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell pigment granules on photosensitized and iron ion-mediated oxidation and the effect of the photodegradation of <b>melanosomes</b> on their antioxidant properties. Methods. RPE cells were isolated from human and bovine eyes; pigmented and nonpigmented bovine retinal pigment epithelia were isolated separately. <b>Melanosomes,</b> melanolipofuscin, and lipofuscin granules were isolated from human RPE donors older than 60. <b>Melanosomes</b> were photodegraded by exposure to blue light. Oxidation of RPE cells or of linoleate was induced by iron/ascorbate in the presence and absence of pigment granules. The photosensitized oxidation of histidine was induced by blue light irradiation of cationic porphyrin. The progress of oxidation was monitored by electron spin resonance oximetry. Results. Iron/ascorbate induced rapid oxidation in suspensions of nonpigmented bovine RPE cells. The rates of oxidation were diminished approximately four times in suspensions of pigmented bovine RPE cells. Adding bovine <b>melanosomes</b> or synthetic melanin to nonpigmented bovine RPE cells resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of oxidation to levels similar to those of pigmented bovine retinal pigment epithelium. Human <b>melanosomes</b> exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on photosensitized and iron-mediated oxidation. Photodegradation of human <b>melanosomes</b> led to loss of the inhibitory effect on iron-mediated oxidation, whereas their ability to inhibit photosensitized oxidation was enhanced. Conclusions. Human <b>melanosomes</b> act as effective antioxidants by preventing iron ion-induced oxidation. Photodegradation of <b>melanosomes</b> results in the loss of these antioxidant properties while it preserves their ability to deactivate cationic photosensitizers...|$|R

40|$|Melanocytes {{present in}} skin and other organs {{synthesize}} and store melanin pigment within membrane-delimited organelles called <b>melanosomes.</b> Exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation (UV) stimulates melanin production in <b>melanosomes,</b> followed by transfer of <b>melanosomes</b> from melanocytes to neighboring keratinocytes. Melanosomal function {{is critical for}} protecting skin against UV radiation, but the mechanisms underlying melanosomal movement and transfer are not well understood. Here we report a novel fluorescent melanosomal marker, which we used to measure real-time melanosomal dynamics in live human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs) and transfer in melanocyte-keratinocyte co-cultures. A fluorescent fusion protein of Ocular Albinism 1 (OA 1) localized to <b>melanosomes</b> in both B 16 -F 1 cells and HEMs, and its expression did not significantly alter melanosomal distribution. Live-cell tracking of OA 1 -GFP-tagged <b>melanosomes</b> revealed a bimodal kinetic profile, with <b>melanosomes</b> exhibiting combinations of slow and fast movement. We also found that exposure to UV radiation increased the fraction of <b>melanosomes</b> exhibiting fast versus slow movement. In addition, using OA 1 -GFP in live co-cultures, we monitored melanosomal transfer using time-lapse microscopy. These results highlight OA 1 -GFP as a specific and effective melanosomal marker for live-cell studies, reveal new aspects of melanosomal dynamics and transfer, and are relevant to understanding the skin’s physiological response to UV radiation...|$|R
40|$|Melanoma cells, in {{comparison}} to normal melanocytes, contain higher concentrations of redox active species and yet are inefficient in mediating oxidative stress. We attribute these features to changes of intracellular <b>melanosomes</b> and melanin reactivity during the pathogenic process. Eumelanins are redox active pigments containing hydroquinone, semiquinone, quinone and quinone-imine functionalities within their structure. We have previously shown that pro-oxidant properties of synthetic melanin are enhanced by stabilization of the oxidized form of melanin {{as a result of}} metal chelation. Chemical studies using DNA clipping activity of isolated <b>melanosomes</b> from different sources indicated enhanced pro-oxidant properties of <b>melanosomes</b> from melanoma origin compared to melanin from normal melanocytes and sepia origin. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping studies confirm these results both in electrochemically polymerized dihydroquinones and in intact human melanoma cells and suggested generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Ultrastructural investigations of <b>melanosomes</b> by electron microscopy revealed abnormalities in melanin deposition and membrane of the melanoma <b>melanosomes</b> compared to melanocyte <b>melanosomes,</b> which may play a part in higher reactivity of melanoma <b>melanosomes.</b> in related experiments exposure of normal human melanocytes to ultraviolet light radiation –B plus copper and cadmium (but not zinc) salts led to cells that phenotypically resembled dysplastic nevus cells in culture...|$|R
40|$|Melanin within <b>melanosomes</b> {{exists as}} eumelanin or pheomelanin.

The study allows a discovery-based characterization of melanosomal metals, and, because Cu is specifically associated with eumelanin, a hypothesis-based test of the 'casing model' predicting that <b>melanosomes</b> contain a pheomelanin core surrounded by a eumelanin shell. Analysis of Cu, Ca, and Zn shows variable concentrations and distributions, with Ca/Zn highly correlated, and at least three discrete patterns for the distribution of Cu vs. Ca/Zn in different <b>melanosomes</b> - including one with a Cu-rich shell surrounding a Ca/Zn-rich core. Thus, the results support predictions of the casing model, but also suggest that {{in at least some}} tissues and genetic contexts, other arrangements of melanin may co-exist...|$|R
