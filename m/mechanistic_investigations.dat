By exploiting chemical, biophysical, enymological and molecular biology techniques, he has made contributions towards understanding enzymatic mechanisms.

Allemann's work on hydrogen transfer catalysing enzymes including dihydrofolate reductase has led to deep new insights into the contributions from quantum mechanical tunnelling and protein dynamics to the enormous rate accelerations typical of Nature’s catalysts. Allemann’s laboratory has been among the pioneers in synthetic biology and has developed innovative applications such as the first generation of designer enzymes, intracellular biophotonic nanoswitches (photoactivated peptides) and optogenetic tools for the control of biological processes in cell culture and in live organisms, as well as pioneering new methodology in synthetic biology for generating novel unnatural terpene-like non-natural natural products with applications in agriculture and healthcare.|$|E

Despite the recent identification of several factors regulating browning of white fat, {{there is a lack of}} physiological cell models for the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>investigation</b> of progenitor-mediated beige/brite differentiation. We have previously revealed prostacyclin (PGI 2) as one of the few known endogenous extracellular mediators promoting de novo beige/brite formation by relaying beta-adrenergic stimulation to the progenitor level.

We demonstrate the specific and broad induction of thermogenic gene expression by PGI 2 signaling in the absence of lineage conversion, and reveal the previously unidentified nuclear relocalization of the Ucp 1 gene locus in association with transcriptional activation. By profiling the time course of the progenitor response we show that PGI 2 signaling promoted progenitor cell activation through cell cycle and adhesion pathways prior to metabolic maturation towards an oxidative cell phenotype.
