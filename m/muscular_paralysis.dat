5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, <b>muscular</b> <b>paralysis</b> and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
2500|$|Botulinum Toxin (BTX) is a {{group of}} {{neurotoxins}} consisting of eight distinct compounds, referred to as BTX-A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, which are produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and lead to <b>muscular</b> <b>paralysis.</b> A notably unique feature of BTX is its relatively common therapeutic use in treating dystonia and spasticity disorders, as well as in inducing muscular atrophy despite being the most poisonous substance known. BTX functions peripherally to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction through degradation of the SNARE proteins required for ACh vesicle-membrane fusion. As the toxin is highly biologically active, an estimated dose of 1Î¼g/kg body weight is sufficient to induce an insufficient tidal volume and resultant death by asphyxiation. Due to its high toxicity, BTX antitoxins have been an active area of research. It has been shown that capsaicin (active compound responsible for heat in chili peppers) can bind the TRPV1 receptor expressed on cholinergic neurons and inhibit the toxic effects of BTX.|$|E

40|$|Gitelman {{syndrome}} (GS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} renal tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia. GS clinical symptoms range from mild weakness to <b>muscular</b> cramps, <b>paralysis</b> or even sudden {{death as a}} result of cardiac arrhythmia. GS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the solute carrier family 12 member 3 (SLC 12 A 3) gene, but molecular mechanisms underlying such a wide range of symptoms are poorly understood. Here we report cryptic exon activation in SLC 12 A 3 intron 12 in a clinically asymptomatic GS, resulting from an intronic mutation c. 1669 + 297 ?T>G that created a new acceptor splice site. The cryptic exon was sandwiched between the L 3 transposon upstream and a mammalian interspersed repeat downstream, possibly contributing to inclusion of the cryptic exon in mature transcripts. The mutation was identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes in GS patients with missing pathogenic SLC 12 A 3 alleles. Taken together, this work illustrates the power of next-generation sequencing to identify causal mutations in intronic regions in asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing potentially fatal disease complications, improving clinical management of these case...|$|R

40|$|The Anterior Compartment Syndrome is a {{relatively}} rare affection with {{a wide spectrum of}} etiologies. Like every compartment syndrome, it is a condition in which high pressure in a rigid osteofascial space reduces capillary blood perfusion so that tissue viability is threatened. When pressure remains sufficiently high for a number of hours, normal muscle and nerve functions become disturbed which may lead to myoneural necrosis. Therefore, an early decompression by means of fasciotomy is essential. Clinical examination is of critical importance in reaching a diagnosis: first of all a painful swelling occurs, followed by <b>muscular</b> paresis or <b>paralysis,</b> and finally loss of sensation and a "silent" electromyogram (EMG).

2500|$|Symptoms of a {{herniated disc}} can vary {{depending}} on the location of the herniation and the types of soft tissue that become involved. They can range from little or no pain if the disc is the only tissue injured, to severe and unrelenting neck or lower back pain that will radiate into the regions served by affected nerve roots that are irritated or impinged by the herniated material. Often, herniated discs are not diagnosed immediately, as the patients come with undefined pains in the thighs, knees, or feet. Other symptoms may include sensory changes such as numbness, tingling, [...] paresthesia, and motor changes such as <b>muscular</b> weakness, <b>paralysis</b> and affection of reflexes. If the herniated disc is in the lumbar region the patient may also experience sciatica due to irritation of one of the nerve roots of the sciatic nerve. Unlike a pulsating pain or pain that comes and goes, which can be caused by muscle spasm, pain from a herniated disc is usually continuous or at least is continuous in a specific position of the body. It is possible to have a herniated disc without any pain or noticeable symptoms, depending on its location. If the extruded nucleus pulposus material doesn't press on soft tissues or nerves, it may not cause any symptoms. A small-sample study examining the cervical spine in symptom-free volunteers has found focal disc protrusions in 50% of participants, which suggests that a considerable part of the population can have focal herniated discs in their cervical region that do not cause noticeable symptoms.|$|R
40|$|Abnormal humoral {{responses}} toward {{motor end}} plate constituents in muscle induce myasthenia gravis (MG). To study the etiology of this disease, and whether it could be induced by host defense molecules, we examined the consequences of interferon (IFN) "y production within the neuromuscular junction of transgenic mice. The transgenic mice exhibited gradually increasing <b>muscular</b> weakness, flaccid <b>paralysis,</b> and functional disruption of the neuromuscular junction that was reversed after administration of an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, features which are strikingly similar to human MG.

Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that a previously unidentified 87 -kD target antigen was recognized by sera from transgenic mice and also by sera from the majority of human MG patients studied.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by extreme muscular weakness and flaccid paralysis. Many lines of evidence indicate that this condition arises {{as a consequence of}} an autoimmune response directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) l of the neuromuscular junction (1 - 3). Mice immunized with AChR purified from the electrogenic organ of Torpedo californica form anti-AChR antibodies and often develop muscular weakness and flaccid paralysis which closely resembles human myasthenia gravis. This condition, termed experimental myasthenia gravis (EMG), is strain dependent in that the frequency of weakness and paralysis is much greater in some strains than in others (4, 5). Mice of the C 57 BL/ 6, SJL, and AKR strains exhibit high susceptibility with 50 - 70 % of the animals immunized developing <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>paralysis.</b> Other strains such as BALB/c, C 3 H/He, and SWR display low susceptibility with 0 - 15 % of the animals immunized developing muscular weakness.

40|$|Afdeling Fysiologie. Many {{important}} aspects of our life are regulated by the free cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. The intracellular Ca 2 + signal is regulated both in space, frequency and amplitude. Each cell chooses {{a unique set of}} Ca 2 + signals to control its function. Ca 2 + signal transduction is based on rises in free cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. Ca 2 + can come from the extracellular space or be released from intracellular stores. Extracellular Ca 2 + enters the cell through various types of plasma-membrane Ca 2 + channels and leaves the cell using Ca 2 + pumps and Na+/Ca(2 +) -exchangers. Ca 2 + is accumulated in intracellular stores by means of Ca 2 + pumps and is released via inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) and ryanodine receptors. Mutations or abnormalities in one of the above mentioned Ca(2 +) -transporting proteins can lead to disease. Skeletal-muscle pathology can be caused by abnormal ryanodine receptors (malignant hyperthermia, porcine stress syndrome, central core disease), plasma-membrane Ca 2 + channels (hypokalemic periodic <b>paralysis,</b> <b>muscular</b> dysgenesis mice, paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome) or Ca 2 + pumps (Brody disease).

40|$|Acute {{organophosphate}} (OP) intoxication {{is associated}} with many symptoms and clinical signs, including potentially life-threatening seizures and status epilepticus. Instead of being linked to the direct cholinergic toxidrome, OP-related seizures are more probably linked to the interaction of OPs with acetylcholineindependent neuromodulation pathways, such as GABA and NMDA. The importance of preventing, or recognizing and treating OP-related seizures lies in that, {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) damage from OP poisoning is thought to be due to the excitotoxicity of the seizure activity itself rather than a direct toxic effect. <b>Muscular</b> weakness and <b>paralysis</b> occurring 1 - 4 days after the resolution of an acute cholinergic toxidrome, the intermediate syndrome is usually not diagnosed until significant respiratory insufficiency has occurred; it is nevertheless a major cause of OP-induced morbidity and mortality and requires aggressive supportive treatment. The condition usually resolves spontaneously in 1 - 2 weeks. Treatment of OP intoxication relies on prompt diagnosis, and specific and immediate treatment of the lifethreatening symptoms. Since patients suffering from OP poisoning can secondarily expose care providers via contaminated skin, clothing, hair, or body fluids. EMS and hospital caregivers should be prepared to protect themselves with appropriate protective equipment, isolate such patients, and decontaminate them. After prompt decontamination, the initial priority of patient management is an immediate ABCDE (A : airway, B : breathing, C : circulation, D : dysfunction or disability of the central nervous system, and E : exposure) resuscitation approach, including aggressive respiratory support, since respiratory failure is the usual ultimate cause of death. The subsequent priority is initiating atropine therapy to oppose the muscarinic symptoms and diazepam to prevent or control seizures, with oximes added to enhance acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity recovery. Large doses of atropine and oximes may be necessary for poisoning due to suicidal ingestions of OP pesticides...|$|R
