40|$|The {{methods used}} in geology to {{determine}} colour and colour coverage are expensive, time consuming, and/ or subjective. Estimates of colour coverage {{can only be}} approximate since {{they are based on}} rough comparison- based measuring etalons and subjective estimation, which is dependent upon the skill and experience of the person performing the estimation. We present a method which accelerates, simpli es, and objecti es these tasks using a computer application.

Colour identi cation is based on the <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> <b>system.</b> For the purposes of colour calibration we use the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport colour chart placed onto the photographed scene. Our computer application detects the ColorChecker colour chart, and nds a colour space transformation to calibrate the colour in the photo.

The results of the computerised colour calibration were compared to the reference values of the ColorChecker chart. The values slightly deviate from the exact values, but the deviation is around the limit of human capability for visual comparison. We have devised an experiment, which compares the precision of the computerised colour analysis and manual colour analysis performed on a variety of rock samples with the help of geology students using Munsell Rock-color Chart. The analysis showed that the precision of manual comparative identi cation on multi- coloured samples is somewhat problematic, since the choice of representative colours and observation points for a certain part of a sample are subjective.

40|$|Colour names behave quite {{differently}} in different languages. In fact, each language, or language group, sets its own colour naming system. Romance languages (along with some Germanic languages) inherited the central name for red from an Indo-European root h 1 reudh (see ruber / rubeus (Latin) and rosso (Italian), rouge (French), rojo (Spanish), roig (Catalan), red (English), rot (German), rood (Dutch) or rød (Danish)). The cognate noun both in Galician and in Portuguese (i. e. roxo), {{even though it}} may have been used as a name for red, it is now the colour name that can be translated into English by the noun purple. These two eastern peripheral romance languages, along with Catalan, favoured the Latin noun vermiculus (cf. vermello (Galician), vermelho (Portuguese) and vermell (Catalan)) as the unmarked designation for red. Counter wise, it is also possible to find cognate words in the above-mentioned first set of languages, but these words refer less central red hues (cf. vermiglione (Italian), bermejo (Spanish), vermilion (English), vermiljoen (Dutch), vermilion (Danish)) or even a non-colour term, like the French vermeil. In this paper, we discuss the variation that the spectrum of red colour names exhibits in a small set of languages, somehow related to Portuguese, which is set at the centre stage. This discussion takes their etymological relationships, their chronological nexus and their contemporary reinterpretations in numeric encodings, such as RGB or CMY into consideration. The analysis of these data allows inferring that the large array of colour and hues, shades and tints, as described, for instance by the <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> <b>system,</b> has no linguistic equivalence: colour names reflect a limited amount of colour distinctions, fulfilled by an unstable set of nouns. Colour names change within and across languages, they frequently change in time and their meaning also often changes. Probably, all this instability is set for independent linguistic reasons, related to the effects of language contact situations and to strict lexical principles, such as economy. Portuguese will again be invoked to demonstrate that derived or compound names used to refer to those chromatic narrow distinctions may keep their stylistic or literary pertinence, but are unable to maintain any unambiguous meaning. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{the health of}} the Belizean barrier reef through economic growth, Watershed Reef Interconnectlvity Scientific Study (WRIScS) have been investigating the application of satellite colour imagery for water quality monitoring. Waters in the region are optically shallow (< 25 m) in that seabed colouration influences water colour. Before water quality information can be gained, seabed optical properties need to be identified for satellite colour validation. Typical instrumentation (e. g. reflectance radiometer) used in seabed ground truthing are prohibitively expensive for developing countries as Belize. In conjunction with WRIScS, this study investigated the application of <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> charts and underwater digital photography as alternative low-cost approaches, during a ground truthing program of the Belizean coast. <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> charts were matched to seabed colour and their reflectance information gained from a database. Reflectance information was derived from seabed digital imagery by the ratio of seabed RGB pixel values to pixel values of a white surface, photographed on the seabed. A compact digital camera was used in the study. Data of each approach was evaluated against reflectance radiometer data, collected during the program. Study finding showed consistent correlation of radiometer and Munsell data. Although accuracy decreased slightly with an increase in wavelength, believed to be linked to greater light penetration of shorter wavelengths. Consequently, a cautious approach is recommended in the use of Munsell values for red light. The approach was concluded reliable, though best suited to measuring sediment colour than other mediums. Light values measured from digital imagery varied significantly within an image and were inconsistent with image depth, casting doubt in data validity. In addition, correlation of digital data was found subjective. A laboratory study found probable cause of the chromatic aberrations to be camera autoexposure and white balance functions, and their degree of influence dependent upon prevailing conditions and subject matter, therefore unpredictable. The study concluded, at current, the potential of this grade of digital camera in underwater studies is limited. WATERSHED REEF INTERCONNECTIVITY SCIENTIFIC STUDY (WRISCS) BELAMA, BELIZE C.

40|$|Fire is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} with important implications on soil properties. The degree of this impact depends upon fire severity, the ecosystem affected, topography of the burned area and post-fire meteorological conditions. The study of fire effects on soil properties is fundamental to understand the impacts of this disturbance on ecosystems. The aim of this work was to study the short-term effects immediately after the fire (IAF), 2, 5, 7 and 9 months after a low-severity spring boreal grassland fire on soil colour value (assessed with the <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> chart), soil organic matter content (SOM) and soil water repellency (SWR) in Lithuania. Four days after the fire a 400 m 2 plot was delineated in an unburned and burned area with the same topographical characteristics. Soil samples were collected at 0 - 5 cm depth in a 20 m × 20 m grid, with 5 m space between sampling points. In each plot 25 samples were collected (50 each sampling date) {{for a total of}} 250 samples for the whole study. SWR was assessed in fine earth (< 2 mm) and sieve fractions of 2 - 1, 1 - 0. 5, 0. 5 - 0. 25 and < 0. 25 mm from the 250 soil samples using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) method. The results showed that significant differences were only identified in the burned area. Fire darkened the soil significantly during the entire study period due to the incorporation of ash/charcoal into the topsoil (significant differences were found among plots for all sampling dates). SOM was only significantly different among samples from the unburned area. The comparison between plots revealed that SOM was significantly higher in the first 2 months after the fire in the burned plot, compared to the unburned plot. SWR of the fine earth was significantly different in the burned and unburned plot among all sampling dates. SWR was significantly more severe only IAF and 2 months after the fire. In the unburned area SWR was significantly higher IAF, 2, 5 and 7 months later after than 9 months later. The comparison between plots showed that SWR was more severe in the burned plot during the first 2 months after the fire in relation to the unburned plot. Considering the different sieve fractions studied, in the burned plot SWR was significantly more severe in the first 7 months after the fire in the coarser fractions (2 - 1 and 1 - 0. 5 mm) and 9 months after in the finer fractions (0. 5 - 0. 25 and < 0. 25 mm). In relation to the unburned plot, SWR was significantly more severe in the size fractions 2 - 1 and < 0. 25 mm, IAF, 5 and 7 months after the fire than 2 and 9 months later. In the 1 - 0. 5 - and 0. 5 - 0. 25 mm-size fractions, SWR was significantly higher IAF, 2, 5 and 7 months after the fire than in the last sampling date. Significant differences in SWR were observed among the different sieve fractions in each plot, with exception of 2 and 9 months after the fire in the unburned plot. In most cases the finer fraction (< 0. 25 mm) was more water repellent than the others. The comparison between plots for each sieve fraction showed significant differences in all cases IAF, 2 and 5 months after the fire. Seven months after the fire significant differences were only observed in the finer fractions (0. 5 - 0. 25 and < 0. 25 mm) and after 9 months no significant differences were identified. The correlations between soil <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> value and SOM were negatively significant in the burned and unburned areas. The correlations between <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> value and SWR were only significant in the burned plot IAF, 2 and 7 months after the fire. In the case of the correlations between SOM and SWR, significant differences were only identified IAF and 2 months after the fire. The partial correlations (controlling for the effect of SOM) revealed that SOM had an important influence on the correlation between soil <b>Munsell</b> <b>colour</b> value and SWR in the burned plot IAF, 2 and 7 months after the fire. © Author(s) 2014. & Author(s) 2014...|$|R
