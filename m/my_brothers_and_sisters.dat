500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> who were in her charge." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{reaching}} Philadelphia, Tubman {{thought of}} her family. [...] "I was a stranger in a strange land," [...] she said later. [...] "y father, my mother, <b>my</b> <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> and friends were [...] But I was free, {{and they should be}} free." [...] She worked odd jobs and saved money. The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, as part of the British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps custom {{here was}} so entrenched that Jesus simply {{stopped short of}} fully {{implementing}} a principle that he made explicit and emphatic: [...] "Whoever does the will of God is <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> mother." ...|$|R

5000|$|Bailey {{argues that}} {{according}} to Middle Eastern customs, Jesus could not properly have gestured to a crowd of men and said, [...] "Here are <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> mother." [...] He could only have said that to a crowd of both men and women. Therefore, the disciples standing before him were composed of men and women.|$|R
2500|$|A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, 2 January 1850' tells one family's sad story: [...] "I am now, I may say, {{alone in}} the world. All <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> are dead and {{children}} but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all Ireland {{in such a state}} of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as I said before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post." ...|$|E
2500|$|The burs: In the caverns {{above the}} mouth area {{there are several}} spiky burs; when Kurelek was young he had the {{sensation}} that these were stuffing up his throat. One has been dissected, cutting through many layers, only to find a worm in the center. This was {{a reference to the}} doctors' effort of analysis and diagnosis turning out to be [...] "not worth the trouble." [...] Another of the burs is inverted with spikes pointed inward, piercing through a small child. On either side of the bur is a smiling face and an angry face, representing two sides to Kurelek's father. His father is referenced as another bur behind, [...] "the hard domineering blue bur, opening up the mushy yellow bur, my mother, to release a common lot of burs, <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> and one unique orange one - myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{described}} her upbringing as [...] "very quiet and happy." [...] At age three, she {{took part in}} her first singing competition at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival. She took part in pantomimes at Gweedore Theatre and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's church in Derrybeg. She learned English at primary school and began piano lessons at age four. [...] "I had to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I ... remember <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> playing outside ... and I would be inside playing the piano. This one big book of scales, practising them over and over." [...] At eleven, Enya's grandfather paid for her education at a strict convent boarding school in Milford run by nuns of the Loreto order, where she developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin and watercolour painting. [...] "It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family, but {{it was good for}} my music." [...] Enya left the school at 17 and studied classical music in college for one year with the aim of becoming [...] "a piano teacher sort of person. I never thought of myself composing or being on stage." ...|$|E
