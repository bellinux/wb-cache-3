40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present article is to critically evaluate efforts undertaken by the Govt. to abolishthe <b>manual</b> <b>scavengers</b> and to study {{the reasons for the}} failure of such programs: Secondary data such as articles,Books, legislations related to <b>manual</b> <b>scavengers</b> were used to meet the study objectives. The Scavenger and sewageworkers suffer mainly from chemical and biological hazards. This can be prevented through engineering, medicaland legislative measures. The engineering measure should focus on making the process more mechanistic. Theseworkers should also be benefited from occupational health services, which should include pre-placement andperiodic health monitoring. Further effective implementation of the Employment of <b>Manual</b> <b>Scavengers</b> andConstruction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, will help in the abolition of manual scavenging. Also, regularawareness programs should be conducted to impart education regarding safer work procedures and use of personalprotective devices.
