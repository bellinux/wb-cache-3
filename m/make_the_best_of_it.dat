5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> working within the existing framework.|$|E
25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would help build a great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{themes of}} the lyrics include contrast, contradictions and urgency. According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, [...] "Martin seems to address the {{helplessness}} {{of being in a}} dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape." [...] The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion: [...] "Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?" [...] The song's title also [...] "metaphorically alludes" [...] to its lyrics, [...] "pushing one to wonder about the world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> when we’re here, present and alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was ignored}} by college recruiters {{and did not}} receive a single letter of {{interest}} until recruiter Hal DeJulio from the University of San Francisco (USF) watched him {{in a high school}} game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and [...] "atrocious fundamentals", but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in the clutch. When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted. Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism; as a consequence, Russell swore to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just try to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher.

2500|$|The airport {{designator}} [...] "SUX" [...] {{has been}} contentious. [...] Sioux City Mayor Craig Berenstein in 2002 described SUX as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] to the city. [...] After petitioning the FAA for a changed airport identifier in 1998 and 2002, authorities found the alternatives offered - GWU, GYO, GYT, SGV, and GAY - to be unappealing, and elected {{to stay with}} SUX. In October 2007, airport board member Dave Bernstein proposed embracing the identifier, saying [...] "Let's <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I {{think we have the}} opportunity {{to turn it into a}} positive," [...] and noting [...] "I've got buddies that I went to college with in different cities that can't even remember their own birthdays, but they all know the Sioux City designator — SUX." [...] The airport now sells merchandise with the words [...] "Fly SUX".|$|E
2500|$|Father de la Colombière {{directed}} Sister Margaret Mary {{to write}} {{an account of the}} apparition, which he discreetly circulated in France and England. After his death on 15 February 1682, his journal of spiritual retreats was found to contain a copy in his handwriting of the account that he had requested of Margaret Mary, together with a few reflections on the usefulness of the devotion. This journal, including the account – an [...] "offering" [...] to the Sacred Heart in which the devotion was explained – was published at Lyon in 1684. The little book was widely read, especially at Paray le Monial. Margaret Mary reported feeling [...] "dreadful confusion" [...] over the book's contents, but resolved to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> approving of the book for the spreading of her cherished devotion. Along with the Visitandines, priests, religious, and laymen espoused the devotion, particularly the Capuchins. The reported apparitions served as a catalyst for the promotion of the devotion to the Sacred Heart. Jesuit Father Croiset wrote a book called , and Fr. Joseph de Gallifet, SJ, promoted the devotion. The mission of propagating the new devotion was especially confided to the religious of the Visitation and to the priests of the Society of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
