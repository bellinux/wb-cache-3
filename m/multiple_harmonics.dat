Most of these data, which are observed using DNA microarrays, consist of few sampling points in time, but most periodicity detection methods require a relatively large number of sampling points.

We show that this method has higher sensitivity for data consisting of <b>multiple</b> <b>harmonics,</b> and is more robust against noise than other methods.

While numerous studies have focused on the evaluation of the optimal training parameters using sEMG recordings during WBV, its validity is still debated.

Starting with the noncommutative polynomial algebraQ〈x,y〉, we define a second multiplication which is commutative and associative, and call the resulting structure the harmonic algebra h.
