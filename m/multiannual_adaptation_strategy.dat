40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{difficulty}} and thus effort and expenses involved in creating them, personalization strategies in learning environments have to demonstrate a higher returnon-investment (ROI), {{if they are to}} be a viable component of the learning setting of the future. One feature that can increase this ROI is the reusability of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> in Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems. This research looks into various ways of enhancing this reusability. Using multiple modular <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> (MAS) with a controlling metastrategy is proposed as a more efficient way of authoring <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies.</b> This renders the reuse of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> faster and easier for course authors. A method for semi-automatically breaking down complex <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> into smaller modular <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> is described. Potential problems with using multiple strategies are described and ways to solve them are discussed. Finally, some evaluation points are illustrated, conclusions are drawn and further research areas are identified...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} rice farmers' {{selection of}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> {{to cope with}} and offset the {{effects of climate change}} and the determinants of those selections in Rajshahi, a severely drought-prone district of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - Farm level micro-data was obtained from 550 rice growers in the 2010 - 2011 farming season. A multinomial logit (MNL) model was utilised to assess the determinants of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> practised by farmers in response to climate change. Findings - Results from the MNL model indicate that gender, age, education of household heads, household assets, annual farm income, farm size, tenure status, farmer-to-farmer extension, access to credit, access to subsidy, and access to electricity, all affect farmers' selection of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> for climate change. Originality/value - This is the first study of its kind to analyse the determinants of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> for climate change by farmers in drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. This study provides direction for policy makers in order to strengthen the <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> of farmers and guide policies accordingly.

40|$|This study {{examined}} smallholder farmers' level of perception about climate change, {{source of information}} on climate change, types of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies,</b> factors influencing <b>adaptation</b> choices and barriers to adaptation in Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. The surveyed farm households {{in the study area}} perceived at least one aspect of climate change primarily through their life experience. Planting trees is the major adaptation measure and 89. 1 percent of the farmers took this <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy.</b> Most farmers (96 percent) believe that deforestation is the main cause of climate change and the choice of farmers to plant trees as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> may be partly a mitigation strategy.

The main source of information for these <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> for 58. 4 percent of the respondents is from extension advice.

40|$|Both in {{academic}} literature and political practice, resilience {{is becoming a}} central evaluative concept for assessing climate adaptation policies. This makes sense because society&# 039;s main challenge in an altering the environment is {{to adapt to the}} inevitable changes. However, applying the concept of resilience to devise <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> reveals that social-ecological resilience acquires different meanings depending on the social context. There is no straightforward application of resilience. In this contribution, it will be argued that giving meaning to the concept of resilience in <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> requires making normative choices. These choices concern whether there is a public interest in adaptation, the distribution of private and public responsibilities, and striking a balance between individual rights and general interests. Because these normative choices can be questioned and revised, it is important that they are made explicit to enable a democratic debate on the direction that <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> should take. Simply referring to the concept of resilience in an <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> does not suffice, but occludes this discussion. Through formulating and applying a condensed scheme of politico-theoretical approaches that underpin diverging adaptation approaches, this contribution reveals the various underlying normative assumptions and explicates the relevant political choices. Three Dutch <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> serve as empirical examples. They illustrate the importance of the societal context in giving meaning to resilience in the development of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} allocation {{system is}} capable of dynamically reallocating functions between different agents. In adaptive allocation, the need for reallocation can be determined using different parameters (trigger mechanisms) such as fluctuation in workload or changes in physiology of the human agent. The <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> can {{determine the amount of}} reallocation and set the new level of the automated agent. The first experiment evaluated the effects of trigger type (performance or heart rate) and <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> (complete reallocation or partial transformation) on the number of errors made. The presence of adaptive allocation reduced the number of errors. The ANOVA results indicate interaction effect between the trigger type and <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy.</b> Due to the presence of an interaction effect, interpretations of the main effects of trigger type or <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> type are difficult. The combination of a partial transformation strategy and heart rate trigger mechanism resulted in substantially more (nearly 114 %) errors than other combinations. The errors made in the other combinations were not significantly different. The second experiment monitored the level of automation over time for presence of stabilization. There is no strong evidence to indicate that the time to stabilization is less than 30 minutes. As the time to stabilization is more than 30 minutes, inferences about main effect of trigger type or <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> could not be made. Based on the contingency table analyses, there appears to be an effect of <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> on the mean level of automation and the effect of trigger type on the time of onset of stabilization. Based on the post-hoc ANOVA analyses, there appears to be an interaction effect between the trigger types and <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategy</b> type on the number of reallocations and the probability of a change in level of automation being observed. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{the benefits of}} framing {{adaptation to climate change}} as an issue of climate risk management and describes a number of methods and approaches that may be applied {{in the process of developing}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies.</b> A key consideration when developing <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> is to have a sound understanding of how a given system functions in response to changes in both climate and non-climate factors, and thus the need for a causal model which represents this understanding. There are a range of methods and tools that may be applied to assist with developing this system understanding in a climate risk assessment, and a number of these are described here. Moreover, given that adaptation planning is to a large degree about forward planning, all <b>adaptation</b> <b>strategies</b> will need to appropriately consider the implications of uncertainty on their likely effectiveness.
