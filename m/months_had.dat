He departed for overseas service in October 1915 having been promoted to lieutenant and posted to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. He saw brief service during the Senussi Campaign in the Middle East with the 2nd Battalion of the brigade.|$|E

5|$|There {{remained}} {{the men of}} the Ross Sea Party, who were stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound, after Aurora had been blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. The ship, after a drift of many <b>months,</b> <b>had</b> returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join Aurora, and sailed with her to the rescue of the Ross Sea party. This group, despite many hardships, had carried out its depot-laying mission to the full, but three lives had been lost, including that of its commander, Aeneas Mackintosh.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Morris {{returned}} to England, {{the setting for}} his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series. In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes. After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris warmed up in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70. However, his performances {{in the first two}} drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70. The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling. However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands. Denis Compton pulled Morris' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets. This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes {{for the first time in}} two decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career. It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50. Morris' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the Invincibles tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of Alec Bedser, in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come until almost four <b>months</b> <b>had</b> elapsed on tour, against the Gentlemen of England. Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages. He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.|$|E
5000|$|Trewartha's {{modifications}} to the 1899 Koppen climate system sought to reclass the middle latitudes into three groups: C (subtropical)—8 or more <b>months</b> <b>have</b> a mean temperature of 10 C or higher; D temperate—4 to 7 <b>months</b> <b>have</b> a mean temperature of 10 °C or higher; and E boreal climate—1 to 3 <b>months</b> <b>have</b> a mean temperature of 10 °C or higher.

25|$|Time {{began to}} press on the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses. More than six years had elapsed since the {{monument}} was first proposed, and donations were only trickling in. Eighteen <b>months</b> <b>had</b> passed since the Secretary of War gave his consent to erect a monument, and there seemed little {{reason to believe that}} more time would allow the order to construct a grander memorial. In early 1905, the order contracted with Barclay Bros., a granite company in Barre, Vermont, to produce the memorial.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review {{published by the}} Cochrane Collaboration, compared Rifamycins (monotheraphy and combination therapy) to INH monotheraphy as an alternative in preventing active TB in HIV negative populations. The evidence suggested that shorter Rifampicin regimes (3 or 4 <b>months)</b> <b>had</b> higher treatment completion rates and fewer adverse events when compared to INH. However, {{the overall quality of}} evidence as per GRADE criteria was low to moderate. Another meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion, namely that rifamycin-containing regimens taken for 3 months or longer had a better profile in preventing TB reactivation.|$|E
25|$|George W.

The result forecast a tough two-man race for the GOP nomination, which would carry on until Super Tuesday in March. Al Gore helped himself with a narrow win in the Democratic primary, which somewhat assuaged his supporters' concerns about Bill Bradley's insurgent campaign.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three <b>months</b> <b>had</b> passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E
25|$|At 10:00pm on Saturday, the King and Queen Sirikit, {{with the}} help of a {{hydraulic}} tappet, set light to a 40m (130ft) high funeral pyre. The $5.7m (£3.8m) temporary royal crematorium, a complex of pavilions constructed on the Sanam Luang parade ground over seven <b>months,</b> <b>had</b> been lavishly decorated with flowers, garlands and carved banana stalks. After the cremation, the funeral buildings will be torn down, as they are sombre reminders of a royal death. According to Hindu belief, it is said that the spirit of the princess will then return home to Mount Meru, where all deities eternally live.|$|E

When he finally returned to Taiwan, five <b>months</b> <b>had</b> passed. The trip took a heavy toll on his health. He barely {{had the strength to}} eat or talk.

25|$|Where many {{calculations}} {{are done}} in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very {{significant effect on the}} result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 <b>months</b> <b>had</b> fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, {{in such a way that}} the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{his friend}} Lorenzo Perrone's {{physical}} and psychological health declined and died. Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six <b>months</b> <b>had</b> given part of his ration {{and a piece of}} bread to Levi without asking for anything in return. The gesture constant actions saved Levi's life. In his memoir, Levi contrasted Lorenzo with everyone else in the camp, prisoners and guards alike, as someone who managed to preserve his humanity. After the war, Lorenzo could not cope with the memories of what he had seen, and descended into alcoholism. Levi made several trips to rescue his old friend from the streets, but in 1952 Lorenzo died.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{merchant}} ships calling at Finnish ports and requiring icebreaker assistance {{during the winter}} <b>months</b> <b>had</b> increased steadily since the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers, Murtaja and Sampo, {{were built in the}} 1890s. In 1902 General Nikolai Sjöman, the director of the Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority, made a proposal to the Senate of Finland for the construction of the third state-owned icebreaker. While reluctant at first, in May 1906 the Senate announced that the old Murtaja could be replaced with a new icebreaker and a call for bids was sent to a number of suitable shipyards. On 4 September 1906 a decision was made to order a new icebreaker even though no buyer had been found for the old Murtaja.|$|E
