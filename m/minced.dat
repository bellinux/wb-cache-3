5|$|Kubba is a dish made of rice/semolina/burghul (cracked wheat), <b>minced</b> {{onions and}} finely ground lean beef, lamb or chicken. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with <b>minced</b> beef, chicken or lamb. It {{was brought to}} Israel by Jews of Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian origin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often <b>minced</b> meat and tomatoes, sometimes {{a layer of}} egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and <b>minced</b> meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely <b>minced</b> parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
5|$|Chopped {{herbs are}} often {{sprinkled}} {{on the surface}} of the soup; dill is most common, but parsley, chives or scallion are often added as well. Individual helpings may be spiced up with <b>minced</b> hot peppers or garlic. Many kinds of borscht are served over halves or quarters of hard-boiled chicken or quail eggs. Navy beans, broad beans or string beans are also a common addition.|$|E
5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or <b>minced</b> clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then <b>minced</b> afterward.|$|E

5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are <b>minced</b> and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} grilled, {{but they can}} be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled in an attempt to {{replicate}} the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of <b>minced</b> hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of <b>minced</b> meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} recipe for clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were <b>minced</b> canned clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets.

5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (<b>Minced</b> Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E

40|$|Formaldehyde {{formation}} and reaction with muscle proteins in lean fish species during frozen storage {{is considered to}} be a major factor affecting texture and functionality deterioration. Formaldehyde {{formation and}} reaction with muscle compounds was reduced in lean fish <b>minces</b> and model systems when lipids with different degrees of oxidation were added. In order to increase the lipid content and slow down functional and textural changes, hake (Merluccius merluccius) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) <b>minces</b> mixed in the ratios 3 : 1; 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 (w/w) were stored at - 20 °C and studied for 1 year. Dimethylamine formation and, by deduction, formaldehyde formation increased. However, less free formaldehyde was detected, probably owing to reaction with muscle compounds in the mixed <b>minces.</b> Nevertheless, addition of sardine <b>minces</b> improved the texture, protein solubility and viscosity of the mixed <b>minces</b> compared with the hake <b>minces.</b> In the mixed lots, formation of large protein aggregates was delayed or prevented. This suggests that in the mixed <b>minces</b> formaldehyde reacted with proteins in a different way from that in lean fish or reacted with other muscle components not directly involved in textural changes. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Cryoprotection in {{stabilized}} <b>mince</b> from Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) {{was investigated}} by monitoring changes in {{physical and chemical}} properties during 32 weeks of frozen storage. The effects of 4 different cryoprotectants were evaluated by torsion test, color analysis, extractability of salt soluble proteins, and formation of dimethylamine (DMA) and 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The quality of the stabilized <b>mince</b> was significantly higher than the control (<b>mince</b> without cryoprotectants) when compared by shear strain, salt soluble proteins, and DMA.
