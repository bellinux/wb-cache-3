A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range is associated with subjectve hyperacusis. Normal hearing threshold is generally defined as 020 decibels (dB).

The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for V. mandarinia. Another <b>measured</b> <b>parameter</b> was attempted patch entry.

Lastly, fights between these hornets, Pseudotorynorrhina japonica, Neopegoschkevitschii species, and Lethe sicelis were observed, and once more V. mandarinia was the most dominant species. In 57 separate fights, one loss was observed to Neopegoschkevitschii, giving V. mandarinia a win rate of 98.3%. Based on interaction-mediated departures, attempted patch entry, and interspecific fights, V. mandarinia is the most dominant species.|$|E

50|$|Photoconductive {{detection}} {{is similar}} to photoconductive generation. Here, the voltage bias across the antenna leads is generated by the electric field of the THz pulse focused onto the antenna, rather than some external generation. The THz electric field drives current across the antenna leads, which is usually amplified with a low-bandwidth amplifier. This amplified current is the <b>measured</b> <b>parameter</b> which corresponds to the THz field strength. Again, the carriers in the semiconductor substrate have an extremely short lifetime. Thus, the THz electric field strength is only sampled for an extremely narrow slice (femtoseconds) of the entire electric field waveform.|$|E

50|$|Dispersed Particle Resistance (DPR) is a <b>measured</b> <b>parameter</b> to {{characterize}} battery active materials. It {{is seen as}} an indicator of lithium-ion battery active material rate capability. It is the slope of voltage-current linear fit for active material samples in suspensions. It can be obtained by applying different voltages on a suspension and measure the currents, after which the data points are plotted. The slope of the plot is referred to as Dispersed Particle Resistance. It can also be done in the opposite way where different currents are applied and voltages are measured. The key advantage of this Dispersed Particle Resistance technique is fast and accurate comparing with the conventional characterization method for which batteries need to be fabricated and tested for a long time.|$|E

50|$|Ternary Tree Shape Plots. A {{methodology}} for plotting different tree shapes graphically {{was developed by}} Frank using ternary plot diagrams. Ternary plots {{can be used to}} graphically display any set of data that includes three terms which total to some constant. Generally this constant is 1 or 100%. This is ideal for plotting the three most commonly measured tree dimensions. The first step in the analysis is to determine what an average shape for trees is in general. These three basic parameters can be expressed as a ratio of height to girth to average crown spread. Some trees are tall and narrow, while others are low and broadly spreading. The data used to determine the average tree shape is derived from a tabulation of the largest trees of each of 192 different species in the NTS 2009 dataset. The average girth, height, and crown spread values were calculated for the measurements included in the listing. For the dataset the average height was 87.6 feet, the average girth was 100.1 inches, and the average spread was 54.9 feet. It is not critical that these values be exact for analysis purposes. The next step is to standardize each <b>measured</b> <b>parameter.</b> The quantity measured for a particular tree is divided by the standard value as determined above. The next step is to normalize the data set so that the sum of the three parameters expressed as a percentage will equal one. This enables the shapes of different trees of different sizes to be compared. The final step is to plot these results as a ternary graph to better compare the results. As an example, the measurement data for 140 live oaks measured as part of the NTS Live Oak Project were graphically plotted using this process.|$|E
