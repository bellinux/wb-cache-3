5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{movement}} is opened by the orchestra and {{it consists of}} a number of variations around a single lush, heavily romantic melody following one another without a rigid scheme. The melody soon moves to the tonic major which is the second theme. After the first theme development and recapitulation of the second theme, the main melody from the first movement reappears, before the {{movement is}} closed by the orchestra {{in a manner similar to}} the introduction. Then the piano gets the last word with a short [...] "cadenza-esque" [...] passage which moves into the last movement [...] Many melodic thoughts of this movement allude to Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto, third movement, noticeably the Russian-like E <b>major</b> <b>melody.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{next three}} Pat Metheny Group {{releases}} {{would be based}} around a further intensification of the Brazilian rhythms first heard in the early '80s. Additional South American musicians appear as guests, notably Brazilian percussion player Armando Marcal. Still Life (Talking), (1987) was the Group's first release on new label, Geffen Records, and featured several tracks which have long been popular with the group's followers, and which are still in their setlist. In particular, the album's first tune, [...] "Minuano (Six Eight)", represents {{a good example of}} the Pat Metheny group compositional style from this period: the track starts with a haunting minor section from Mays, lifts off in a typical Methenian jubilant <b>major</b> <b>melody,</b> leading to a Maysian metric and harmonically-modulated interlude, creating suspense which is finally resolved in the Methenian major theme. Another popular highlight was [...] "Last Train Home", a rhythmically relentless piece evoking the American Midwest. The 1989 release Letter from Home continued this approach, with the South American influence becoming even more prevalent in its bossa nova and samba rhythms.|$|E

50|$|Geraldine’s lament is {{set with}} a G <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> with hints of modal mixture, over a B flat major accompaniment. The only stable {{moment in the}} arietta occurs {{on the subject of}} Geraldine’s ill mother, where the music solidifies on B flat major and the meter changes from 3/2 to 4/2, before {{returning}} to the G <b>major</b> <b>melody.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{the second}} movement, Newbould {{repeated}} the F <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> (this {{time in the}} tonic, B) {{at the end of}} the recapitulation, in analogy to the exposition. He also used the coda that Schubert had discarded, since in his view, it had been crossed out in order to restate the melody before.|$|E
50|$|The oldest txistu melodies are {{characterized}} by a Mixolydian mode in G, {{which is the same}} as the seventh mode in Gregorian chanting. More recently composed songs are still in G major, but in either natural or sharp F or, more rarely, C. There are exceptions, however, in <b>major</b> F <b>melodies</b> with natural B.|$|R
50|$|This {{brooding}} opening {{gives way}} to one of Scriabin's most beautiful melodies, a second subject in D <b>major.</b> The <b>melody</b> is treated canonically, with multiple voices echoing above an extremely widespread left-hand accompaniment. The closing groups, also in D major, are grand and confident with rhythmic obsessiveness and directional gestures characteristic of Scriabin's heroic writing.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{view that}} perceived emotion in music is derived mainly from auditory signals {{has led to}} neglect of the contribution of visual image. In this study, we manipulated mode (major vs. minor) and examined {{the influence of a}} video image on emotional judgment in music. <b>Melodies</b> in either <b>major</b> or minor mode were controlled for tempo and rhythm and played to the participants. We found that Taiwanese participants, like Westerners, judged <b>major</b> <b>melodies</b> as expressing positive, and minor melodies negative, emotions. The <b>major</b> or minor <b>melodies</b> were then paired with video images of the singers, which were either emotionally congruent or incongruent with their modes. Results showed that participants perceived stronger positive or negative emotions with congruent audio-visual stimuli. Compared to listening to music alone, stronger emotions were perceived when an emotionally congruent video image was added and weaker emotions were perceived when an incongruent image was added. We therefore demonstrate that mode is important to perceive the emotional valence in music and that treating musical art as a purely auditory event might lose the enhanced emotional strength perceived in music, since going to a concert may lead to stronger perceived emotion than listening to the CD at home...|$|R
5000|$|Newbould {{claims that}} the F <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> was [...] "too beautiful" [...] to be heard only once, and that Schubert's {{intention}} was to repeat it in the recapitulation (in the tonic major, B major) before the coda (as expected in sonata form), but that he left those details aside and he began the third movement instead.|$|E
50|$|Sally’s arietta has {{a rounded}} binary form, {{with the first}} section {{characterized}} by a repetitive eighth note pattern on the words “I want to buy that hat of peacock feathers!” The line is sung over pulsating E flat and B flat major triads.

50|$|The second movement, whose lyricism is {{reminiscent}} of the composer's Winterreise, as well as foreshadowing Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, is also laid out in sonata form. In the sketch, Schubert crossed out the coda, despite no apparent falling-off quality. Also, a haunting (in Newbould's words) F <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> {{at the end of the}} second subject group of the exposition does not reappear later in the movement (it had been added as an afterthought in another page, apparently after discarding the coda).|$|E

Unlike the scherzo of the B-flat minor sonata (and, indeed, the rest of Chopin's contributions to the genre outside of the sonatas), it is exceptionally short, typically lasting barely two minutes in performance.|$|E
5000|$|It {{opens in}} sonata form, softly in the strings, {{followed}} by a theme shared by the solo oboe and clarinet. A typically laconic Schubertian transition consists of just four measures for the two horns, effectively modulating to the subdominant parallel key of G major (measures 38-41). The second subject begins with a celebrated lyrical melody in that key, stated first by the celli {{and then by the}} violins (sometimes drolly sung to Sigmund Spaeths words as [...] "This is ... the sym-phoneee ... that Schubert wrote but never fin-ished") to a gentle syncopated accompaniment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect Of vibrotactile stimulation (via the SOMATRON™), instrumen tation (flute versus belIs), and precomposed melodies (pan tatonic versus major) on physiological and behavioral re sponses of profoundly retarded children/adults. Fifteen profound/y handicapped clients ages 6 - 46 served as subjects for this study. Subjects received four music therapy treat ments; two with vibrotactile stimulation and two without. Each treatment consisted of four prerecorded music condi tions composed, recorded, and performed by the researcher. These were: pentatonic mode and bells, pentatonic mode and flute, major mode and be//s, and major mode and flute. Respirations and pulse rate served as physiological mea sures, while observations of eye movement, facial expres sion, vocalizations. and motor movement served as behav ioral measures. Deep inhalations were shown to increase significantly during musical stimulation. The type of musical stimulation did not affect these results. Statistically significant increases in vocalizations occurred during the <b>major</b> flute <b>melody</b> as compared with the <b>major</b> bells <b>melody.</b> The <b>major</b> flute <b>melody</b> was a/so significant/y more effective in eliciting vocalizations when not accompanied with vibrotactile stim ulation.

50|$|The {{first section}} is, as mentioned, very mysterious, as Scriabin employs many tritones and seventh {{intervals}} {{which do not}} fall into the key of C minor. The first 8 bars feature modulations to D-sharp minor and F minor. The ninth bar, marked con anima, introduces an E <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> using more conventional harmonies, but the piece only delves yet again deeper {{into the depths of}} the mystery four bars later. Here, marked fortississimo, the initial melody comes out in full force using the broad tessitura scope of the piano. At the seventeenth bar, the piece calms to quiet block chords of F minor, C minor-7, and B major-9 (without the bass B), finally resolving to an arpeggiated final C minor chord, reminiscent of the ninth prelude immediately preceding this one. This shows Scriabin's ability to find commonality in his most diverse works.|$|E

This lyrical, passionate, tender and romantic melody, played {{at a relatively}} dainty tempo, paints a picture of peace {{and a sense of}} harmony between the piano and the orchestra, and has also inspired its title 'Romanze'. Halfway through, the piece moves on to the second episode (part C), where the beautiful melody is replaced with a turbulent, agitated and ominous theme in the relative minor key of G minor, which greatly contrasts the peaceful mood at the starting of the movement. Finally, we are greeted once again with the aforeheard melody which returns as the movement is nearing the end. The piece ends with an ascending arpeggio that is light and delicate, gradually until it becomes a faint whisper.|$|E

40|$|On average, melodies in minor keys have smaller {{intervals}} between successive tones than melodies {{in major}} keys—consistent {{with the emotional}} difference between major and minor (Huron, 2008). Huron and Davis (2012) additionally showed that {{a part of this}} difference is inherent in the structure of major and minor scales, in combination with typical patterns of transition between scale steps: if one takes a typical <b>major</b> <b>melody</b> and lowers scale steps 3 and 6 by a semitone, then the average interval size is optimally reduced. I present an alternative theory of the origin of major and minor scales/keys and their emotional connotations. Huron's (2006) data on scale-step transitions in typical melodies is consistent with Schenker's (1922, 1935) idea that a piece of tonal music can be interpreted as a prolongation of its tonic triad (mediated by the Ursatz). The emotional difference between major and minor may ultimately and primarily depend on the third of the tonic triad in the psychological background. Major music may tend toward positive valence simply because emotionally positive music is more common than emotionally negative music, and major triads and keys are more common than minor. Minor music may tend toward negative valence simply because scale degrees 3 and 6 sound lower than expected, consistent with emotional cues in speech (Huron, 2008) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{subject of}} this movement is 7 bars long, consisting mainly of bass broken chord accompaniment and a melody. The subject, however, sub-divides itself into regular one-bar sections, which is very unusual. At bar 8, the melody modulates immediately to the key of B major, where a new melody is introduced. This carries on until the prolonged cadential extension from b. 13 to b. 16. The rest of b. 16 consist of a link on the dominant of E to the next section, so that the music can modulate back and repeat the original 7-bar melody again, with extra ornaments and decorations added to the melody. The second section, or the episode, begins in A <b>major.</b> Interestingly, this <b>melody</b> starts off {{exactly the same as}} Beethoven’s 2nd movt. Pathétique sonata. This first part of the episode modulates to a B major cadence, which gives way to the second section of the episode, commencing in G <b>major.</b> The same <b>melody</b> is repeated, followed by a sequential passage going through A minor, B minor, and C minor, ending on a half-cadence. Two more bars modulate back to E major, where the original melody returns, embellished with decorations and ornaments to the maximum possible.
