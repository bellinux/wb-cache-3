Job references, certifications and similar from the time before the change of name may be reissued with the new name, so effectively there is no way for a new employer to learn about the change of name and/or legal gender. Also, people with only a name change do not have to divulge their legal gender to employers.|$|R
50|$|The Freshman Cake Race is a foot {{race from}} the Russ Chandler Stadium to Bobby Dodd Stadium {{that takes place}} before sunrise (about 6:00 am) {{on the morning of}} the {{homecoming}} game. This distance is about a one-half mile, so the crowd of several hundred participants engages in a mad sprint over the relatively short distance. The race runs through the middle of the campus's Greek sector and is often subject to tampering by fraternity students. The competitors are supposed to be freshmen (students with less than 30 hours of credit), and the race is split up by gender. The winners receive cakes baked by faculty, alumni, or students, and all participants receive cupcakes. The winners also receive a kiss from <b>Mr.</b> <b>or</b> <b>Ms.</b> Georgia Tech at the homecoming half-time show.|$|R
5000|$|The {{correct way}} to address a member or fellow of The Royal College of Surgeons {{is to use the}} title <b>Mr,</b> Miss, <b>Mrs,</b> <b>or</b> <b>Ms</b> (not Dr). This system (which applies only to {{surgeons}}, not physicians) has its origins in the 16th century, when surgeons were barber-surgeons and did not have a medical degree (or indeed any formal qualification), unlike physicians, who held a University medical degree.When the College of Surgeons received its royal charter, the Royal College of Physicians insisted that candidates must have a medical degree first. Therefore, an aspiring surgeon had to study medicine first and received the title Doctor. Thereafter, having obtained the diploma of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons he would revert to the title [...] "Mr" [...] as a snub to the RCP. Nowadays the title [...] "Mr" [...] is used by Members of the College who have passed the diploma MRCS examination and the College addresses Members as [...] "Mr" [...] or [...] "Ms".|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland {{and in some}} Commonwealth {{countries}} (such as South Africa, New Zealand {{and some}} states of Australia), many surgeons use the title <b>Mr</b> (<b>or</b> Miss, <b>Ms,</b> <b>Mrs,</b> as appropriate), rather than Dr (Doctor). Until the 19th century, earning a medical degree was not required to become a qualified surgeon. Hence the modern practice of reverting from Dr back to Mr after successfully completing qualifying exams in surgery (e.g., Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons) is a historical reference to the origins of surgery in the United Kingdom as non-medically qualified barber surgeons.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) in London {{began to}} offer {{surgeons}} a formal status via RCS membership. The title Mister became {{a badge of}} honour, and today, in many Commonwealth countries, a qualified doctor who, after at least four years' training, obtains a surgical qualification (formerly Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, but now also Member of the Royal College of Surgeons or {{a number of other}} diplomas) is given the honour of being allowed to revert to calling themselves <b>Mr,</b> Miss, <b>Mrs</b> <b>or</b> <b>Ms</b> {{in the course of their}} professional practice, but this time the meaning is different. It is sometimes assumed that the change of title implies consultant status (and some mistakenly think non-surgical consultants are Mr too), but the length of postgraduate medical training outside North America is such that a qualified surgeon may be years away from obtaining such a post: many doctors used to obtain these qualifications in the senior house officer grade, and remain in that grade when they began sub-specialty training. The distinction of Mr (etc.) is also used by surgeons in the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Barbados, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and some other Commonwealth countries.|$|R

5000|$|Pochi/Ponpokoriichitchoriina III (Pochi/Ponpokoriichicchoriina San Se) : A tanuki who {{can speak}} the human language. It speaks about {{himself in the}} first person in the Japanese manga. Its gender is unknown, and when it met with Utsuho, it was around eight months old. Pochi puts [...] "san" [...] (a rough {{equivalent}} of <b>Mr.</b> <b>or</b> <b>Ms.)</b> at the end of everyone's name he meets, and speaks in polite speech. Its mother was killed by a cruel trapper, and was saved by Utsuho when it seemed Pochi was going to be captured as well. It then becomes [...] "family" [...] with Utsuho, and goes on his journey to save 1,000 people with him as the first member of his party. It has a very strong bond with Utsuho, and likely has the most amount of trust with him. It is very polite and has very good manners, but has some faults in its thinking, and is quite an optimistic airhead. Because of this, Pochi often causes trouble for {{the other members of the}} party. When Pochi's heart is moved by something, it has a habit of clapping its hands in applause. Pochi is the opposite of Utsho, as it has no skills in lying in the least, and is quite simple. However, thanks to that simpleness, Pochi was able to obtain one of the 9 Treasures, the [...] "Seven-Colored Rainbow" [...] very easily, which the others could not do. At the beginning of the series, Pochi was very weak-willed, but in later developments Pochi has gained the courage to draw on the enemy's faces or try to save Utsuho from danger. As Pochi has been [...] "raised" [...] by Utsuho, Pochi has come to not know fear. Pochi has a tendency to draw out his sentences, adding [...] "～" [...] marks to the end of his speech to show his slow-speaking personality.|$|R

5000|$|In {{this area}} of Southern Illinois, it is not {{unreasonable}} to assume <b>Mr.</b> <b>M</b> <b>or</b> the radio news team had actually seen an animal. People we interviewed framed the recent events in these terms. Their accounts admitted the possibility that large dogs, calves, bears, deer, and wildcats had been sighted. Some frames suggested that an exotic pet, such as an ape or a kangaroo, was the catalyst for the monster reports. Finally, some people tactfully suggested that Mr. M. had a notoriously overactive imagination and had probably been shooting at shadows. In any event, we interviewed only one person who agreed with Mr. M's claim that he had indeed seen [...] "a monster from outer space." ...|$|R

The appearances came in a vague, casual, aimless way, just as the living and healthy clergyman appeared to the diplomatist. On St. Augustine's theory the dead persons who appeared may have known no more about the matter than did the living clergyman. It is not even necessary to suppose that the dead man was dreaming about the living person to whom, or about the place in which, he appeared. But on the analogy of the tales in which a dream or thought of the living seems to produce a hallucination of their presence in the minds of other and distant living people, so a dream of the dead may (it is urged) have a similar effect if [...] "in that sleep of death such dreams may come". The idea occurred to Shakespeare! In any case the ghosts of our stories hitherto have been so aimless and purposeless as to resemble what we might imagine a dead man's dream to be.|$|R

There is something highly maddening in the circumstance that when modern people attack an institution that really does demand reform, they always attack it for the wrong reasons. Thus many opponents of our public schools, imagining themselves to be very democratic, have exhausted themselves in an unmeaning attack upon the study of Greek. I can understand how Greek may be regarded as useless, especially by those thirsting to throw themselves into the cut throat commerce which is the negation of citizenship; but I do not understand how it can be considered undemocratic. I quite understand why Mr. Carnegie has a hatred of Greek. It is obscurely founded on the firm and sound impression that in any self-governing Greek city he would have been killed. But I cannot comprehend why any chance democrat, say <b>Mr.</b> Quelch, <b>or</b> <b>Mr.</b> Will Crooks, I <b>or</b> <b>Mr.</b> John <b>M.</b> Robertson, should be opposed to people learning the Greek alphabet, which was the alphabet of liberty.
