5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, an injured Borg drone (Jonathan Del Arco) is found amid a crashed scout ship. As they restore him to health, the crew <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not to develop him as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} against the Borg, but when he demonstrates free will, they must question that decision.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target {{for the time being}} by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the player}} {{and the newly}} {{assembled}} army of Ferelden fight their way through Denerim, which has been overrun by the Darkspawn. After fighting {{their way through the}} Darkspawn horde and conquering the Archdemon atop Denerim's highest tower, the player <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> they or Alistair/Loghain delivers the killing blow. The Archdemon killed, the leaderless Darkspawn army retreats from Denerim, marking the end of the Fifth Blight. However, if the ritual with Morrigan was not performed, whoever slays the Archdemon also perishes. The story ends with a ceremony attended by the people of Ferelden during which the player and their companions are honored for saving the kingdom. Lastly, an epilogue details in text and pictures the ramifications of the player's in-game choices, including the future of Ferelden and the fates of his or her companions.|$|E

5|$|With Alden on {{a murderous}} rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him {{once and for}} all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no {{connection}} to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.|$|E
5|$|In Act III, {{the player}} meets the Founder of the Academy, and Safiya realizes that she, Lienna, and Nefris are all {{splinters}} of the Founder’s soul, {{and that the}} Founder was once Akachi’s lover. The Founder explains that, while Lienna and Nefris understood their identities, the truth was hidden from Safiya for her own safety. The Founder also admits that she {{is responsible for the}} player's plight – she wanted to use the player to end the spirit-eater curse (and Akachi’s suffering, as well). She returns the silver sword of Gith to the player, which allows him to open the Betrayer's Gate and travel to the realm of the dead. There the player finds the City of Judgment, ruled by the current God of the Dead, Kelemvor Lyonsbane. As the player arrives, an army is assembling outside the walls, led by Akachi’s captains from his First Crusade – Zoab, a fallen solar, Rammaq, a demilich, and Sey'ryu, a blue dragon. The captains recognize the player as Akachi’s heir, and the player <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to lead their crusade against the City of Judgment or to oppose them.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John Blow and even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible as regards the original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, a criticism levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz Päetow, with the libretto becoming unstuck in time.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, another {{citizenship}} {{reform law}} was soon introduced after Helmut Kohl finished his last term as Chancellor. The Citizenship Law of 1999, which was officially taken into effect on January 1, 2000, has facilitated {{the acquisition of}} German citizenship for people born outside of Germany, making it available to Turkish immigrants {{after eight years of}} legal residence in the country. The law’s most innovative provision granted dual citizenship to Turkish-origin children born in Germany; however, by age twenty-three German-born Turks can no longer be dual citizens and <b>must</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to keep their German citizenship or the citizenship of their parent’s country of birth.|$|E

Regardless of {{the fate of the}} Inquisition, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, and plans to gather allies in Tevinter, noting that given Solas's familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition, they need to recruit people he has not encountered before.|$|E

The responses highlighted great variation in practice medication management, reflecting a lack of firm evidence favoring any one approach.|$|R
