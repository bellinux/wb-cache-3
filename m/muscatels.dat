In his present employment Mr. Gladstone was called upon to handle a mass of questions that were both of extreme complexity in themselves, and also involved collision with trade interests always easily alarmed, irritated, and even exasperated. With merchants and manufacturers, importers and exporters, brokers and bankers, with all the serried hosts of British trade, with the laws and circumstances of international commerce, he was every day brought into close, detailed, and responsible contact:--Whether the duty on straw bonnets should go by weight or by number; what was the difference between boot-fronts at six shillings per dozen pairs and a 15 per cent. duty ad valorem; how to distinguish the regulus of tin from mere ore, and how to fix the duty on copper ore so as not to injure the smelter; how to find an adjustment between the liquorice manufacturers of London and the liquorice growers of Pontefract; what was the special case for <b>muscatels</b> as distinct from other raisins; whether 110 pounds of ship biscuits would be a fair deposit for taking out of bond 100 pounds of wheat if not kiln-dried, or 96 pounds if kiln-dried; whether there ought to be uniformity between hides and skins. He applies to Cornewall Lewis, then a poor-law commissioner, not on the astronomy of the ancients or the truth of early Roman history, but to find out for a certain series of years past the contract price of meat in workhouses. He listens to the grievances of the lath-renders; of the coopers who complain that casks will come in too cheap; of the coal-whippers, and the frame-work knitters; and he examines the hard predicament of the sawyers, who hold government answerable both for the fatal competition of machinery and the displacement of wood by iron. 'These deputations,' he says, 'were invaluable to me, for by constant close questioning I learned the nature of their trades, and armed with this admission to their interior, made careful notes and became able to defend in debate the propositions of the tariff and to show that the respective businesses would be carried on and not ruined as they said. I have ever since said that deputations are most admirable aids for the transaction of public business, provided the receiver of them is allowed to fix the occasion and the stage at which they appear.' ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Muscatel</b> {{is a type}} of wine {{made from}} muscat grapes. The term is now {{normally}} used in the United States to refer to a fortified wine made from these grapes rather than just any wine made from these grapes. This fortified <b>muscatel</b> became popular in the United States when, at the end of prohibition, {{in order to meet the}} large demand for wine, some poor strains of muscat grapes (used normally for table grapes or raisins) mixed with sugar and cheap brandy were used to produce what has since become infamous as a wino wine. This kind of fortified wine has, in the United States, damaged the reputation of all muscat-based wines and the term <b>muscatel</b> tends no longer to be used for these [...] "better" [...] wines in the United States. In other markets the term <b>Muscatel,</b> or Moscatel, refers to a wide range of sweet wines based on these grapes.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the influence of variety, clarification type, fermentation tempera-ture, and the addition of selected yeast on wines to obtain dry wines from grape must of <b>Muscatel</b> and Malvasia varieties. An experimental design was tried, based on 74 white wine samples identified through 19 analytical variables and submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and principal component analysis (PCA). The study is carried out with two varieties of white Vitis vinifera grapes (<b>Muscatel</b> and Malvasia) which are used in the production of Spanish white wine. The must was clarified following two different procedures (static decantation and membrane filtration) and later fermented at laboratory scale at three temperatures (15 °C, 18 °C, and 21 °C) and two yeast types (D 47 and K 1 M) were inoculated into the must. Significant differences were found according to grape variety, clarifica-tion, temperature, and yeast type when ANOVA and MANOVA were performed. The application of PCA to the data showed that differences between organic acids and higher alcohols are mainly due to the grape variety and the yeast type used for fermentations. With the results found, we propose the best conditions to obtain dry wines from <b>Muscatel</b> and Malvasia varieties.

Some phenolic acids. stilbenes as resveratrol and piceid, and flavonols as quercetin and quercetin glycosides were identified in these <b>Muscatel</b> wines.
