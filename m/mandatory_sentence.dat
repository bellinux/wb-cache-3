5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder: death by hanging.|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises {{the debate}} about <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing,</b> {{outlines}} various measures adopted in New South Wales to place limits on judicial discretion in <b>sentencing,</b> and reviews <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws in other Australian jurisdictions. Introduction: <b>Mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws became a very controversial issue in Australia in the late 1990 s when they were introduced for repeat home burglary offenders in Western Australia and for property offences in the Northern Territory. In recent years, NSW and other States, including Queensland and Victoria, have introduced <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws for other types of offences. The NSW Government is now proposing to adopt further <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws, {{as a part of}} a range of measures to deal with alcohol-related violence. On 21 January 2014, the NSW Premier, Barry O’Farrell announced that the Government intended to introduce: Eight year <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>sentence</b> for those convicted under new one punch laws where the offender is intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol, plus new <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>sentences</b> for violent assaults where intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol. In NSW, <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws have also been raised in debates about child sex offenders; and also in response to the spate of drive-by shootings involving bikie gangs in Western Sydney. A media report on 7 November 2013 suggested that the Government was considering introducing minimum five-year sentences for gang members illegally in possession of firearms. This e-brief summarises {{the debate about}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing.</b> It further outlines various measures adopted in NSW to place limits on judicial discretion in sentencing, and it reviews <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws in other Australian jurisdictions...|$|R
25|$|During the 2011 {{legislative}} session, Anderson was {{the sponsor}} of House Bill 241. Aimed at public safety, this bill added shotguns and rifles {{to the list}} of weapons for which a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> is required. The bill also increased the sentencing to 15 years in prison. Anderson's House Bill 302, which also became law in 2011, changed Maryland's practice of parole approval. Maryland {{was one of the few}} states that left parole decisions, in life sentence cases, up to the Governor. Anderson's bill shifted those decisions to the parole board if the governor did not act on parole board recommendations.|$|E
25|$|In Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} such a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> for a crime {{committed}} as a juvenile was unconstitutional, even for a person who committed murder, as it did not allow for what is scientifically known about juvenile brains, nor for mitigating factors, and cut off the possibility of reform {{that might lead to}} freedom. It directed state courts to review sentences for all persons covered under this ruling, an estimated 1200 to 1800 nationwide. Draper and Adamcik are among the inmates whose sentences will be reviewed by state courts under this ruling.|$|E
25|$|At the trial, the {{prosecution}} revealed that Brian {{had said he}} was impressed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre. Later Adamcik {{was said to have}} been inspired by the Scream horror film franchise. On April 17, 2007, Draper was found guilty. Adamcik's trial started on May 31, 2007; he was convicted on June 8, 2007. On August 21, 2007, based on being convicted of first-degree murder, each received a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of life in prison without the possibility for parole, and 30 years-to-life for being convicted of conspiracy to commit murder.|$|E
40|$|A {{shift in}} public mood and declining incarceration {{rates in the}} US signal a {{potential}} change {{in the politics of}} punishment. This research considers whether the public continues to support <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing.</b> The study expands upon existing knowledge by testing theoretical predictions about how instrumentalism, political beliefs and political participation affect public support for <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences.</b> Drawing on a state-wide survey of 1, 569 adults from Oregon the study found that belief in the effectiveness of prosecutors, judges, and prisons significantly influenced support for <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing.</b> Although 67 % of those surveyed favored judicial discretion, a firm belief that “prisons work” may limit efforts to reduce incarceration and roll back <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences...</b>|$|R

The three strikes and out policy raised incarceration rates of indigenous women by 223% in the first year. The incarceration rate for men rose by 57% and 67% for indigenous men. The <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> laws sparked debate of the laws being discriminative (indirectly) as indigenous people are overrepresented in the crime statistics in the Northern Territory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> is at {{the heart}} of the problem on Jayadev's view. By {{removing}} judicial discretion with <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences,</b> judges are not allowed to look at each case individually and make judgements about sentences that take into consideration the circumstances of the offense and future prospects for the person convicted. In Anderson's May 5, 2014 hearing, the judge was able to and did consider questions of circumstance, behavior, and future prospects. However, because of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing,</b> these questions could not be considered when Anderson was originally sentenced to prison.|$|R
25|$|Baddour {{subsequently}} sentenced Lovette to life {{in prison}} without the possibility of parole. Neither Lovette nor Carson's parents spoke before the sentence was handed down. On February 5, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated Lovette's life sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing. The decision relied on Miller v. Alabama, where the Supreme Court ruled that a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of life in prison without parole for defendants under 18 at the time of a crime is cruel and unusual punishment. On June 3, a re-sentencing hearing was held. After Baddour considered mitigating circumstances, Lovette was again sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, {{the court}} reconvened {{to hear the}} verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not {{suffering}} from a mental disorder {{at the time of}} each of the 15 murders for which he was tried, although in each count, two of the 12 jurors signified their dissent. On the first two counts, Dahmer was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years, with the remaining 13 counts carrying a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment plus 70 years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase as the State of Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.|$|E
25|$|The Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 {{suspended}} {{the death penalty}} in Great Britain (but not in Northern Ireland) for murder for a period of five years, and substituted a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment; it further provided that if, before the expiry of the five-year suspension, each House of Parliament passed a resolution to make the effect of the Act permanent, then it would become permanent. In 1969 the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, proposed a motion to make the Act permanent, which was carried in the Commons on 16 December 1969, and a similar motion was carried in the Lords on 18 December. The death penalty for murder was abolished in Northern Ireland on 25 July 1973 under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{not guilty}} verdict, the two Inuit men {{were taken to}} Calgary in late August, where they were found guilty {{of the murder of}} Le Roux. This was the first time Inuit had been found guilty of murder in a Canadian court. The law at that time had a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of death for the crime of murder, yet the jury and the judge did not wish for the pair to die for their crimes owing to the provocative nature of the priests' actions before their deaths. To avoid the death penalty, the judge sentenced the pair to death by hanging, with the {{execution}} date set as October 15. The sentence was immediately commuted to life imprisonment at a Fort Resolution police station. In 1919, the pair assisted police in establishing a new police contingent at Tree River, and in 1922 were released.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} give a ‘criminological perspective’ on <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing.</b> It will however largely avoid {{the issues of the}} effect of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> {{provisions}} on the judicial process and judicial independence, as this has already been covered by Sir Anthony Mason. It will also avoid the legal issues concerning the constitutional, human rights and international law aspects of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> which will be covered by later speakers. The aim will be to give a brief overview of research which evaluates the effects of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> provisions in terms of the available evidence of whether they meet their stated aims of deterrence, selective incapacitation and the reduction of crime rates. This will be done in two parts, first in relation to the more extensive experiment in <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> in the USA which has provided some of the impetus and metaphors ("three strikes") for recent Australian developments; and second the recent <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> provisions in Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT). Evidence from both the US and WA (NT is hard to assess {{because of the lack of}} proper monitoring and criminal statistics) indicates that <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> does not produce the effects of deterrence, selective incapacitation and crime reduction which are its stated justifications and does produce a range of damaging side effects in terms of distortion of the judicial process, wildly disproportionate sentencing, additional financial and social cost and deepening social exclusion of individuals and particular communities. So what is left are the less acknowledged underpinnings of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentencing</b> in the form of the symbolic politics of law and order, the politics of social exclusion and a displacement of racial anxieties and hostilities onto the terrain of the legal. In fashioning this necessarily brief overview a number of sources have been heavily drawn upon, in particular the excellent work by Neil Morgan from UWA (Morgan, 1995; 1999; 2000); Dianne Johnson and George Zdenkowski in their detailed report to the Senate Inquiry (2000); and a number of articles appearing in 1999 in an excellent special issue of the UNSW Law Journal, all of which are highly recommended for further reading...|$|R

While he was rescued soon after, the prison officials had him modified on spurious grounds: he'd survived on the moon surface and they wanted to discourage other prisoners from believing this could be done to escape. For the rest of his sentence, he received 'personal' treatment from the guards: the lack of crooked judges in the early days meant any caught were put through hell.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Maione and Frank Abbandando {{were the}} first members of the Brooklyn [...] "Combination" [...] {{to be put on}} trial for murder. In May 1940, the trial started for the May 25, 1937 ice-pick murder of George [...] "Whitey" [...] Rudnick in a Brooklyn parking garage. Harry Strauss was also indicted for the murder, and, after {{initially}} agreeing to cooperate with the District Attorney's office, he was severed from the trial. On May 15, 1940, Abe Reles testified that Rudnick was marked for death after Strauss claimed he had obtained information that Rudnick was a [...] "stool pigeon for the police." [...] Reles also testified that he waited outside the garage while Maione, Abbandando and Strauss were inside with Rudnick. After Rudnick was believed to have been murdered, Abbandando called for Reles and summoned Angelo [...] "Julie" [...] Catalano to the garage to assist with moving the body. Since Rudnick was still alive, Strauss resumed his assault with an ice pick, and Maione used a meat cleaver to complete the murder. The next day, Catalano, who drove the automobile with Rudnick's body, corroborated Reles' account of the murder. [...] "Dukey" [...] Maffetore and Abe [...] "Pretty" [...] Levine testified that they stole the automobile that was used to dispose of the body. Maione and 14 witnesses testified that he was at his grandmother's wake when Rudnick was murdered. The funeral home undertaker and embalmer testified that Maione was not at the wake. Also, one of Maione's chief witnesses admitted that he committed perjury as ordered by Maione's brother, whom he feared. On May 23, 1940, Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder, which meant a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentence</b> of death in the electric chair. New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned the conviction on a 4–3 vote in December 1940. The second trial started on March 10, 1941. At one point during the trial, Maione lost his temper and threw a glass of water at Reles. Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder for a second time on April 3, 1941. Maione and Abbandando were formally sentenced to death for a second time on April 14, 1941. The Court of Appeals upheld the second conviction on January 8, 1942. Maione and Abbandando were executed at Sing Sing prison on February 19, 1942.|$|E

40|$|The Safe Streets and Communities Act, {{like many}} other parts of the government’s crime agenda, relies on both prosecutorial {{discretion}} and a general judicial reluctance to strike down <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences.</b> Successful Charter challenges to <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences</b> are not impossible, as seen by Molloy J. ’s recent decision in Smickle, but they will be difficult. In particular, the use of reasonable hypotheticals in section 12 analysis may be precluded by reliance on the assumption that longer <b>mandatory</b> <b>sentences</b> will not be applied when the Crown has the power to avoid such sentences by electing to prosecute the relevant crime by way of more lenient summary conviction procedures.
