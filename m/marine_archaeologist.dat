5|$|After a British spy boat sinks, a <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist,</b> Sir Timothy Havelock, is tasked to {{retrieve}} its Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) communication system before the Russians do. After Havelock is murdered by Gonzales, a Cuban hit-man, Bond is ordered {{to find out}} who hired Gonzales. While investigating, Bond is captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of those present with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist</b> and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
25|$|All {{the above}} offers great {{challenges}} to the <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist</b> when attempting to bind the pieces of a certain shipwreck together. Despite these challenges, if the information retrieved {{does not appear to}} be sufficient, or a poor preservation is achieved, authors like J.A. Parker claim that it is the historical value of the shipwreck that counts, as well as any slight piece of information and/or evidence that is acquired.|$|E
50|$|In {{a series}} of expeditions, a team of <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologists</b> led by Robert Ballard {{identified}} {{what appeared to be}} ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet (100 m) of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey.|$|R

25|$|At {{a private}} drinks {{reception}} in the Painted Hall which followed this Arctic service, Chief <b>Marine</b> <b>Archaeologist</b> for Parks Canada Robert Grenier {{spoke of his}} ongoing search for the missing expedition ships. The following day a group of polar authors went to London's Kensal Green Cemetery {{to pay their respects}} to the Arctic explorers buried there. After some difficulty, McClure's gravestone was located. It is hoped that his memorial, in particular, may be conserved in the future. Many other veterans of the searches for Franklin are buried there, including Admiral Sir Horatio Thomas Austin, Admiral Sir George Back, Admiral Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield, Admiral Bedford Clapperton Trevelyan Pim, and Admiral Sir John Ross.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} details {{from the story}} {{are used in the}} film For Your Eyes Only, {{released}} in 1981 and starring Roger Moore as James Bond. The film shows the murder of the Havelocks - a <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist</b> and his wife - by a hit man, although it names the hitman as Gonzalez, rather than Gonzales. The film also changes the name of the Havelock's daughter, Judy, to Melina. For Your Eyes Only also uses much of the plot of [...] "Risico", including the characters of Colombo and Kristatos.|$|E
500|$|The Sackler Gallery, {{part of the}} Smithsonian Institution, was due to {{host the}} US premiere {{exhibition}} of the Belitung cargo in early 2012—a date set {{to coincide with the}} Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration. On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, [...] "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences — including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" [...] wrote {{to the head of the}} Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that [...] "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution." [...] Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that further comments were made by [...] "the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History" [...] all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist</b> and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, [...] "by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian — which is a research institution as well as a network of museums — would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites." ...|$|E

50|$|During the 1961 recovery, {{thousands}} of artefacts and {{the remains of}} at least 15 people were found in and around the Vasas hull by <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologists.</b> Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artefacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden.|$|R
2500|$|Studies {{and site}} visits made in 1999 by a Puerto Rican <b>marine</b> <b>archaeologist</b> and the University of Georgia {{discovered}} nearly two hundred steel barrels of unknown origin and contents among {{the wreckage of}} the Killen. Based on government descriptions of the nuclear tests in the Pacific, some scientists and Vieques environmental activists have been concerned that nuclear-fallout cleaning materials were stored inside those barrels and improperly disposed, possibly entering the local environment prior to sinking or exposing contaminants to the animals and habitat of Bahia Salina del Sur in Vieques after sinking.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{more than}} 140 years after Dr. Rae's report, his account was finally vindicated; blade-cut {{marks on the}} bones {{of some of the}} crew found on King William Island {{strongly}} suggested that conditions had become so dire that some crew members resorted to cannibalism. It appeared from these studies that a combination of bad weather, years locked in ice, poisoned food, botulism, starvation, and disease including scurvy, had killed everyone in the Franklin party. In October 2009, Robert Grenier (a Senior <b>Marine</b> <b>Archaeologist</b> at Parks Canada) outlined recent discoveries of sheet metal and copper which have been recovered from 19th-century Inuit hunting sites. [...] Grenier firmly believes these pieces of metal once belonged to the Terror and formed the protective plating of the ship's hull.|$|E
