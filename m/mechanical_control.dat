25|$|In {{conjunction}} with Parker Hannifin, MPC Products of Skokie, Illinois designed a fly-by-wire technology <b>mechanical</b> <b>control</b> suite for the 717 flight deck. The modules replaced much cumbersome rigging {{that had occurred}} in previous DC-9/MD-80 aircraft. The Rolls-Royce BR715 engines are completely controlled by an electronic engine system (FADEC— Full Authority Digital Engine Control) developed by BAE Systems, offering improved controllability and optimization. The engine has significantly lower fuel consumption compared to other engines of the equivalent amount of thrust.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>control</b> from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the testing}} at Yuma, {{prototype}} #9 received the improved T64-GE-716 engine producing 4,275shp (3,188kW) and the planned production {{version of the}} ICS system. With these upgrades, the helicopter surpassed its performance requirements. However, under certain conditions stability and control did not completely satisfy the test pilots. Lockheed had studied ways to prevent unstable feedback from the gyro. The solution was to relocate the gyro {{from the top of}} the rotor head to below the transmission with flexible connections to the rotor. The pilot's controls were connected to hydraulic servomotors then connected through springs to the gyro. This system prevented rotor vibration forces from transmitting back into the flight controls. It was called the [...] "advanced <b>mechanical</b> <b>control</b> system" [...] (AMCS) and was installed on Cheyenne #7 in 1972 to improve handling and rotor stability.|$|E

2500|$|Common <b>mechanical</b> <b>controls</b> {{generally}} rely on {{disruption of}} {{some aspect of}} the mites' lifecycle. [...] These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. [...] Examples of <b>mechanical</b> <b>controls</b> include drone brood sacrifice (varroa mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), screened bottom boards (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size. A device called the varroa mite control entrance (VMCE) is under development as of 2008. The VMCE works in conjunction with a screened bottom board, by dislodging varroa mites from bees as they enter and exit a hive.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: <b>Controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{ventilation}} {{results in}} diaphragmatic dysfunction, and oxidative stress {{has been shown}} to be an important contributor to ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. We hypothesized that the administration of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, would restore the redox balance in the diaphragm and prevent against the deleterious effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation. DESIGN:: Randomized, controlled experiment. SETTINGS:: Basic science animal laboratory. SUBJECTS:: Male Wistar rats, 14 wks old. INTERVENTIONS:: Anesthetized rats were submitted for 24 hrs to either spontaneous breathing receiving 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (SBNAC) or saline (SBSAL) or to <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation receiving 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (MVNAC) or saline (MVSAL). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: After 24 hrs of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation, diaphragmatic force production was significantly lower in MVSAL compared with all groups. Importantly, administration of N-acetylcysteine completely abolished this <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. Diaphragmatic protein oxidation was significantly increased after 24 hrs of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation (+ 53 %, p <. 01) in MVSAL animals, whereas administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented this <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation-induced oxidative stress. Diaphragmatic 20 S proteasome activity was increased in MVSAL (+ 62 %, p <. 05). Further, compared with SBSAL, diaphragm caspase- 3 activity was significantly increased in MVSAL (+ 279 %, p <. 001), and N-acetylcysteine treatment provided partial protection against caspase- 3 activation (MVNAC = + 158. 5 %, p <. 01). Diaphragmatic calpain activity was significantly increased after <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation (+ 137 %, p <. 001) in MVSAL animals, but N-acetylcysteine treatment protected against this event. Finally, significant negative correlations existed between calpain activity and diaphragm force production (r from - 0. 56 to - 0. 49, p <. 05). CONCLUSIONS:: These data show that the administration of N-acetylcysteine protects the diaphragm from the deleterious effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation. Specifically, N-acetylcysteine prevents against <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation-induced diaphragmatic oxidative stress and proteolysis and abolishes <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilation-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. status: publishe...|$|R

We use forensic analysis of rockfall detachment surfaces (scars) which display fractured surfaces broken through intact rock, termed rock bridges as well as pre-existing discontinuities, to understand failure mechanisms. The relative significance of intact rock fracture versus release along pre-existing surfaces in stability has not been thoroughly investigated using field data. The relative role {{of each of these}} components determines where weakening, is important in controlling the nature and timing of rockfall. This is vital for defining mechanically accurate models of failure.
