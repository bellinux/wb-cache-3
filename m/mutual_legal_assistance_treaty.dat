40|$|Motivated by the {{effectiveness}} of correlation attacks against Tor, the censorship arms race, and observations of malicious relays in Tor, we propose that Tor users capture their trust in network elements using probability distributions over the sets of elements observed by network adversaries.

To illustrate this system, we present two novel types of adversaries. First, we study a powerful, pervasive adversary that can compromise an unknown number of Autonomous System organizations, Internet Exchange Point organizations, and Tor relay families. Second, we initiate the study of how an adversary might use <b>Mutual</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Treaties</b> (MLATs) to enact surveillance. As part of this, we identify submarine cables as a potential subject of trust and incorporate data about these into our MLAT analysis by using them as a proxy for adversary power.

40|$|The {{adjudication}} {{of transnational}} criminal cases is burdened {{by a very}} narrow compulsory process mechanism known as <b>Mutual</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Treaties.</b> These treaties regularize foreign evidence gathering for prosecutors and explicitly prevent their use by criminal defendants. The danger of inaccurate verdicts and wrongful convictions that may result from unequal access to evidence highlights the need to resolve this flawed transnational adjudication process, and specifically, its evidentiary method. Building on the works of Neil Komesar, Ronald Coase, and Mancur Nelson, the author utilizes a comparative institutional analysis approach to consider {{the question of how}} to obtain parity between the prosecution and the defense in the ability to compel foreign evidence in transnational criminal cases. The issue is of great importance in a post- 9 / 11 world where the fairness and accuracy norms that underpin criminal prosecutions are increasingly ephemeral and illusory. The comparative framework illumes the important considerations for identifying the institution best suited to achieve the norm of parity. Criminal process scholars have not explicitly utilized the comparative institutional analysis framework. This oversight is a mistake. The comparative framework provides an ideal theory to dissect criminal process questions. Explicit institutional comparison, rather than simplistic single institutional considerations, should underlie criminal process scholarship addressing fairness and equity norms...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{adjudication}} of transnational criminal cases in the United States raises troubling questions about the government 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to principled criminal process standards. Concern over global crime {{has resulted in a}} criminal process that inadequately protects fairness and legitimacy norms. Over 40 years ago, in his seminal work on the domestic criminal process, Herbert Packer described two models of criminal procedure: the crime control model and the due process model. The crime control model posits that the most important function {{of the criminal justice system}} is to suppress crime. The due process model focuses on the fallibility of the process. Its primary concern is with fairness and reliability. Balancing the norms of the two models is challenging, but necessary. No such balancing exists in the global crime era. Instead, crime control norms usurp due process values as a result of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Treaties</b> (MLATs) which regularize foreign evidence gathering for prosecutors while explicitly preventing defendants from using them. This article breaks new ground by constructing a framework that will both protect due process norms and simultaneously preserve effective crime control. Under the framework, U. S. prosecutors must obtain important foreign evidence needed by defendants in domestic prosecutions. The framework is consistent with existing doctrine, is familiar to the courts and the parties, and will leave MLATs intact so that their benefits can inure to both prosecutors and defendants...|$|R

40|$|As the new {{information}} age develops and grows {{in all areas of}} communication technologies, it imposes new challenges to the legal system in protecting individuals and companies. These new challenges are the result of the Internet increase in scope and complexity. While society is receiving great benefits from the Internet, they are also confronting a new type of crime, cyber crime. Cyber crime includes a wide variety of illegal acts committed using the computer, and because of the continuous technology developments is impossible to create an exhaustive list of all actions considered a cyber crime. In order to facilitate the investigation of cyber crime the U. S. Department of Justice has classified them in three broad categories: when the computer is used as a target or the medium or its use is incidental to other criminal offenses. Crimes using a computer as a target or victim of an offense include actions that intrude the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information or services. The second category includes actions where the computer is used as the tool to commit traditional criminal conduct. This category includes those crimes that have been occurring in the physical world, but now we are seeing with increasing frequency on the Internet. Examples of this type include child pornography, fraud and intellectual property violations. In the third category, the computer is used to store data, which contains evidence of fraud, white collar crimes and viruses for example, and therefore its use is considered to be incidental to the criminal act. In this thesis, I will study primarily the intellectual property crimes committed using the Internet as a tool or medium. This classification includes criminal activity that can be performed by other means, but the criminal has chosen to use the computer as the mechanism. I will also discuss the international dimensions and dilemmas of this crime and as Janet Reno said, “how critical is to create treaties for international cooperation to reduce the threat”. “One of the biggest challenges has been to implement an effective matrix of bilateral <b>mutual</b> <b>legal</b> <b>assistance</b> and extradition <b>treaties.</b> ” Janet Reno, Conference held on September 2000. Chapter 2 discusses the impact of cybercrime against Intellectual Property Rights in the evolution and creation of new intellectual property legislation. Specifically, the absence of a legal scheme that can effectively address the prosecution of cybercriminals. The second part of this chapter contains some of the most significant legislation to prosecute cybercrime, follow by a brief discussion and application of each one. Further, Chapter 3 focus in the challenges this crime create in the conduction of the criminal investigation, how the FBI surveillance works and it impact on private citizens and businesses. The controversies Carnivore has created. Including a discussion on how this type of crime endangers citizens and legitimate businesses causing them multi-millionaire losses. And what Congress should do to combat the crime as well as {{what we can do to}} cooperate.
