5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> their own.

5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, {{but not in the}} westernised sense. The Quran teaches that the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> males and females work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to the husband and wife. One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being head of the household.|$|E

5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century. Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, {{on the grounds that}} they might corrupt the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> youth.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the review panel.|$|E
5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} future {{research}} {{will fail to}} find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but other philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often {{necessary in order to}} open the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> thinkers to new evidence and better explanations.|$|E

Believing she wouldn't be discriminated in Edward's world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward's memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers.

5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{disaster}} King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. This prophecy was again present in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> many people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E

According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E

Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph.

They are said to fight like Indra in battles, invoking terror in <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> enemies; speak different foreign tongues and lives in inaccessible places away from human settlements like crossroads, caves, mountains, springs, forests, riverbanks and cremation grounds. Notable among these lists of Matrikas is Putana, a goddess who tried to kill the infant Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) by suckling him with poisoned breast milk and consequently killed by Krishna.|$|E
