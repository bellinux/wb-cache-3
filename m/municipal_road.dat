5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Municipal</b> <b>Road</b> 35, however, {{has been}} widened {{by the city}} to {{accommodate}} traffic between downtown and the Highway 144 route. A section of <b>Municipal</b> <b>Road</b> 35 between the eastern intersection of Notre Dame Street (<b>Municipal</b> <b>Road</b> 21) in Azilda to Highway 144 in Chelmsford is currently a two-lane highway. There are plans to widen that section of roadway, although no date has been announced.|$|E

25|$|Secondary Highway 610, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 610, was a provincially maintained secondary highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connected Highway101 at Hoyle, east of Timmins, with former Highway67 (now <b>Municipal</b> <b>Road)</b> near Barbers Bay, passing through the village of Connaught en route. Highway610 was assumed by the Department of Highways, predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, in 1956, along with many of the secondary highways in Ontario. It remained unchanged between then and 1997, when it was decommissioned and transferred to the CIty of Timmins. The entire route is now known as Frederick House Lake Road.|$|E
25|$|Highway536 {{followed}} {{what is now}} Sudbury Municipal Road24, travelling {{north from}} Highway17 (now Sudbury <b>Municipal</b> <b>Road</b> 55) near Lively to the mines in Creighton. The former highway has been supplanted by the Northwest Bypass, which is designated as Highway144. Highway536 travelled north from Highway17, passing through the community of Lively, where it was known as Main Street. As it left Lively, it began making a very gradual curve towards the northeast, passing through Dog Patch and skirting {{the southern edge of}} the Creighton Mine. It eventually curved east briefly before making a quick 90degree curve north into the mining town of Creighton. This curve was located at the modern interection with Wellington Street, and was replaced with an intersection upon the completion of the Northwest Bypass (Highway144) in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|The city's <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> {{network is}} centred around {{a series of}} {{high-capacity}} boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts. The main axes, which run north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast, {{as well as one}} internal and one external ring road, support the bulk of the traffic. The city's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. In 2013, the number of cars registered in Bucharest amounted to 1,125,591. This results in wear and potholes appearing on busy roads, particularly secondary roads, this being identified as one of Bucharest's main infrastructural problems. A comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure was made, and according to the general development plan, 2,000 roads have been repaired by 2008. On 17 June 2011, the Basarab Overpass was inaugurated and opened to traffic, thus completing the inner city traffic ring. The overpass took five years to build and is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Romania and the widest such bridge in Europe; upon completion, traffic on the Grant Bridge and in the Gara de Nord area became noticeably more fluid.|$|E

2500|$|Greater Sudbury is {{the only}} census {{division}} in Northern Ontario that maintains a system of numbered municipal roads, similar to the county road system {{in the southern part}} of the province.

An approximately [...] segment of Highway 17, from Mikkola to Whitefish, is freeway. The highway bypasses the city via two separately-constructed roads, the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses, that form a partial ring road around the southern end of the city's urban core for traffic travelling through Highway 17. [...] The former alignment of Highway 17 through the city is now <b>Municipal</b> <b>Road</b> 55. Highway 69, also a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, leads south to Parry Sound, where it connects to the Highway 400 freeway to Toronto; Highway 400 is being extended to Greater Sudbury and is scheduled for completion in 2021.
