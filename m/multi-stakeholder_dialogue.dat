50|$|Closing session: One speaker {{commented that}} while the IGF {{provides}} a forum for dialogue, {{it has not yet}} begun to make recommendations to the organizations involved in Internet governance, as had been the expectation by some {{at the time of the}} Tunis Agenda. Before closing the meeting, Mr. Rimvydas Vaštakas, Vice Minister of Transport and Communications of Lithuania said that the Government of Lithuania would make its voice heard in the forthcoming debate of the United Nations General Assembly, adding that it was important to renew the IGF mandate as a platform for non-binding <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Closing session: Several speakers, {{representing}} all stakeholder groups, {{addressed the}} closing session. Common {{to all the}} speeches was the recognition that Internet governance needed {{to be based on}} multi-stakeholder cooperation. As one speaker pointed out, the lack of multi-stakeholder involvement in the past had often led to ill-informed decision-making. Mr. Sha Zukang, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, in his concluding remarks stressed the centrality of the principle of inclusiveness and the need for continued discussions on public policy issues related to the Internet. He recalled that he would present a report to the Secretary-General on the consultation on the desirability of the continuation of the Forum, as mandated by the Tunis Agenda. The Secretary-General would then communicate his recommendations to the UN Membership. All other speakers expressed their support for an extension of the mandate and emphasized the value of the IGF as a platform for <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In his concluding address, the Chairman of the Fourth IGF Meeting, Mr. Tarek Kamel, said that he was confident that this message, representing the views of all stakeholders, would be conveyed to the Secretary-General.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{stock of}} Internet {{governance}} {{and the way}} forward: While speakers acknowledged that there was still much work to be done, the discussions had matured and moved from basic explanations to good practices and deployment issues. On some issues like internationalization of critical Internet resources speakers felt that progress had been made. While several speakers talked {{about the need for}} a more results oriented IGF, others saw in the IGF practice of not negotiating outcomes one of its strengths, as it allowed for open discussions free from the pressure of negotiations. Several people used the example of the <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue</b> and sharing of information and good practices as proof for the IGF’s viability. Papers such as the Inventory of Good Practices that was posted on the IGF Web site shortly before the Vilnius meeting were mentioned as examples of more tangible results. The increased participation of young people in the 2010 IGF meeting was seen as a positive development. In his closing remarks the Session Chair concluded by observing that power is devolving from governments to other actors through interconnected networks and that the IGF is part of this trend.|$|E

50|$|Closing session: A {{common thread}} {{throughout}} all the speeches at the closing session was {{the recognition that}} the Hyderabad meeting had been a success and that the IGF had proved its usefulness as a space for <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Mr. Jainder Singh, Secretary of the Department of Information Technology in the Ministry for Communications and Information Technology of the Government of India, in his closing remarks expressed the gratitude {{of the people and}} the Government of India to all participants for coming to Hyderabad and for participating in the Third Meeting of the Internet Governance Forum. By being in Hyderabad in spite of the terrorist acts in Mumbai, participants had demonstrated their solidarity with the people of India in facing this menace. He made the point that the Internet today was standing at a threshold, where both limitless opportunities and daunting threats lied ahead. The challenge was to grab the opportunities and exploit them to the fullest while containing, if not eliminating, the threats. It was clear that achieving these objectives would be possible only by concerted and collaborative action by governments, businesses, civil society organizations and academia. The IGF as a forum held great promise as a platform to forge precisely such a grand coalition for universal good.|$|E

Policy advocacy is an important tool to democratise the policy making process.

The protocol should serve as guidance for all relevant actors, such as representatives of affected people, governments, project developers, financers, donors and civil society organisation in cases where a fair compensation needs to be assessed.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that sustainable development encompasses four distinct perspectives: (a) economic, (b) ecological, (c) social, and (d) institutional, which are highly interrelated and complementary. Their interrelatedness {{is even more}} intense {{in the developing world}} where the effects of job creation, entrepreneurship, resource-use, networking, and building good governance are all systemically intertwined. This builds a logical nexus between business profits and social good whereby entrepreneurs doing business in developing countries not only can enhance their own productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency to improve their financial position, but also contribute to the wellbeing of their (host) countries. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present how a systemic outlook can enhance research and practical implementation of sustainable development in developing countries.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{multiple}} crises and change, a range of practices discussed under the umbrella term of collaborative (or sharing) economy have been gaining considerable attention. Supporters build an idealistic vision of collaborative societies. Critics have been stripping the concept of its visionary potential, questioning its revolutionary nature. In the study, these debates are brought down to the local level in search for common perceptions among the co-creators of the concept in Vienna, Austria. Towards this aim a Q study is conducted, i. e. a mixed method enabling analyses of subjective perceptions on socially contested topics. Four framings are identified: Visionary Supporters, Market Optimists, Visionary Critics, and Skeptics, each bringing their values, visions, and practical goals characteristic of different understanding of the collaborative economy. The study questions the need for building a globally-applicable definition of the concept, calls for more context-sensitivity, exploratory studies, and city-level <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} already {{affecting}} ecosystems in protected forest areas. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted its impacts will accelerate rapidly {{over the coming}} decades. The components of vulnerability have been defined as exposure, sensitivity {{and the capacity to}} adapt to climate change. Vulnerability, however, is not an easy concept for policy makers, local communities and other affected stakeholders to understand. This paper illustrates the use of participatory processes in understanding climate change adaptation and defines indicators for assessing the vulnerability of the Javan rhino's national park habitat in Indonesia. The processes generated local vulnerability indicators, organised hierarchically as principles, criteria and indicators (PCIs). While vulnerability principles and criteria were pre-determined and globally defined, the indicators were designed to address the local context. We found the PCIs to be practical tools for communicating vulnerability and for <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogues</b> on vulnerability to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Item 9 of the {{provisional}} agenda* <b>Multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>Multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue</b> Discussion paper on community forestry program in Nepal: {{an example of}} excellence in community-based forest management Summary There is growing evidence that transferring authority and responsibility for sustainable forest management to communities leads to both a significant reduction of poverty and improved forest conditions. The Community Forestry Program of Nepal is a leading example of the achievements and continuing challenges of community-based forest management. By 2009, one third of Nepal’s population was directly participating {{in the management of}} over one quarter of Nepal’s forest area. Significant benefits have flowed from this large-scale mobilization of Nepal’s rural population, including improvements in livelihoods, expanded forest area, conservation of biodiversity, and participation of women. New issues are emerging, such as the need to develop appropriate support services for the development of forest-based community enterprises and to strengthen tenure arrangements to ensure effective implementation of REDD. As interest in community-based forest management grows {{in many parts of the}} world, the experience of the Government and rural communities of Nepal provides a valuable guide. *E/CN. 18 / 2011 / 1 E/CN. 18 / 2011 / 9 /Add. ...|$|E
40|$|The Chainsaw Milling Project {{is using}} <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue</b> (MSD) as its key {{strategy}} for achieving its objectives. In Guyana the dialogue process aims {{to achieve a}} shared understanding of chainsaw milling practices and associated opportunities for economic development at local level. It aims to build consensus among stakeholders to reduce the level of conflict and illegality related to chainsaw milling by local communities; and review regulatory frameworks in order to strengthen governance in the forestry sector. So far the MSD in Guyana has focused largely on addressing chainsaw milling opportunities and challenges at local and regional level. To maximize its effectiveness the dialogue {{is in the process}} of being upscaled to a national level. Narratives, personal experiences and lessons from the MSD at the local level were felt to be useful in support of this endeavour. To that effect project staff and other stakeholders have written “stories” that show the different dimensions of their work but with a common message: this <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogue</b> is of key importance for those who make a living out of the forest, for now and in the future.

40|$|Multi-stakeholder {{support is}} crucial to chain parties {{delivering}} against the (latent) demand and consumption of animal-friendly products. Actors take an ambiguous position {{in dealing with the}} issue of animal welfare improvements, partly because such improvements deviate from the dominant business model aimed at efficient delivery to export markets. This makes <b>multi-stakeholder</b> <b>dialogues</b> an important factor in channelling the issue of animal welfare and, ultimately, in migrating towards more animal-friendly production systems. This paper studies the dynamics in the chain - including lock-ins and barriers - through which the Dutch livestock sector searches for a new equilibrium with society; in this case, through the development of an in-between segment. This analysis improves our understanding of how transitions work on sustainability issues in the agriculture sector.
