5|$|Beginning in 1549, Vermigli became {{involved}} in controversy regarding the Eucharist. He published his disputation with Catholics at Oxford University along with a tract on the subject. He later wrote treatises on the Eucharist against Catholics as well as Lutherans. After Vermigli's death, Robert <b>Masson</b> collected the doctrinal passages scattered throughout these commentaries into a systematic theology called the Loci Communes, which became Vermigli's most well-known work. Several of Vermigli's letters and shorter treatises were also published during and after his life. Beginning in 1994, scholars began translating his works into modern English in a series called the Peter Martyr Library.|$|E

Police later released a statement revealing that one passenger, 84-year-old Margaret <b>Masson</b> from Glasgow, had died in hospital. Her funeral took place on 31 March 2007 at Craigton crematorium in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{was similar to}} the qualification for the 1978 World Cup, when Scotland and Wales were drawn together in the same group. On that occasion, the two played each other in the penultimate group game at Anfield, with Scotland knowing a point would be enough to guarantee qualification for the final tournament in Argentina, while Wales needed a victory to keep their hopes alive for their final game. In the event, a controversial penalty from Don <b>Masson</b> and a late header by Kenny Dalglish gave Scotland the victory.|$|E
5|$|He was in Marseille in late 1940-early 1941, {{joining the}} group of anti-fascist and Jewish {{refugees}} who, protected by American diplomat Varian Fry, were seeking to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Among the people present there were the anti-totalitarian socialist Victor Serge, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, playwright Arthur Adamov, philosopher and poet René Daumal, and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and Benjamin Péret, as well as artists Max Ernst, André <b>Masson,</b> Wifredo Lam, Jacques Hérold, Victor Brauner and Óscar Domínguez. During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new card game, on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{museum in}} Skopje is the Museum of Macedonia which details {{the history of}} the country. Its icons and {{lapidary}} collections are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps some of the best archeological finds in Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former Turkish baths of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign art, with works by Fernand Léger, André <b>Masson,</b> Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's <b>Masson</b> Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E

25|$|At Brunton's urging, <b>Masson</b> went to Harvard University {{to study}} Sanskrit. While at Harvard, <b>Masson</b> became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his {{influence}} on the <b>Masson</b> family form the subject of Masson's autobiographical book My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion. Harvard University granted <b>Masson</b> a B.A. in 1964 and a Ph.D. with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in Sanskrit and Indian Studies.

25|$|Jeffrey Moussaieff <b>Masson</b> (born March 28, 1941 as Jeffrey Lloyd <b>Masson)</b> is an American author. <b>Masson</b> is {{best known}} for his {{conclusions}} about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. In his The Assault on Truth (1984), <b>Masson</b> argues that Freud may have abandoned his seduction theory because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been sexually abused) would hinder the acceptance of his psychoanalytic methods. <b>Masson</b> is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights. Most of his books since 1997 are about animals.|$|E
25|$|Jeffrey <b>Masson</b> {{is the son}} of Jacques <b>Masson,</b> a French Mizrahi Sephardic Jew of Bukharian ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an Ashkenazi strict Orthodox Jewish family. Both of {{his parents}} were {{followers}} of the guru Paul Brunton. Masson's mother later became a follower of mystic John Levy. During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating <b>Masson</b> as his heir apparent. In 1956, Diana and Jacques <b>Masson</b> moved to Uruguay because Brunton believed that a third world war was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Masson's {{great-grandfather}} Shlomo Moussaieff was a kabbalist {{and founder}} of the Bukharian Quarter in Jerusalem. His grandfather Henry Mousaieff changed his family name from Moussaieff to <b>Masson.</b> <b>Masson</b> changed his middle name from Lloyd to Moussaieff.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, <b>Masson</b> began {{studying}} {{to become a}} psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 <b>Masson</b> published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing and being late for sessions. Schiffer denied it and debated <b>Masson</b> on the Canadian television program The Fifth Estate.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, <b>Masson</b> {{edited and}} {{translated}} Freud's complete correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess after having convinced Anna Freud {{to make it}} available in full. He also looked up the original places and documents in La Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, where Freud had studied with Charcot. <b>Masson</b> writes that the scientific community has been largely silent about his views. Several Freud scholars have disputed the traditional story that Freud's seduction theory patients reported having been sexually abused in early childhood, the basis on which <b>Masson</b> built his case.|$|E
