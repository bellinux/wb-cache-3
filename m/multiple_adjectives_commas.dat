50|$|Adjectives {{can be used}} {{to alter}} nouns or clauses and in most cases come after the {{statement}} it is altering. In Irarutu there is also a subclass of adjectives which differentiate the level of magnitude on which the adjective affects the subject/object. There are both clause-level and phrase-level adjectives, each of which affect the topic at hand differently. Nouns with <b>multiple</b> <b>adjectives</b> are indeed possible, but a bit uncommon. Adverbs exist but are often hard to point out in Irarutu sentence structure. Sometimes an entire phrase will be used to modify a verb or adjective. To make the meaning of a sentence clear, specific verbs, which can only be modified by certain adverbs, are used to show what part of the sentence is modifying what. The sequence and placement of the adverb also helps identify which part of the claim it is modifying.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} vague {{words and}} expressions contained in 8 Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) of over-the-counter medical products (4 {{sold in the}} U. K. and 4 in Italy). More precisely, the article focuses on qualifying adjectives describing scale of “seriousness” together with the recommended “dosage”. It also looks at epistemic modal verbs (Halliday 2004; Palmer 1986), as well as adverbial adjuncts (Halliday 2004). “Vagueness {{is a form of}} unclarity – specifically, an unclarity about the boundaries of things” (Raffman 2014, p. 2). As a consequence, a concept or word is vague if it allows borderline cases (Smith 2008, p. 1; Van Deemter 2010, p. 8). PILs (and not only) are rich in vague expressions: sometimes they are “necessary” (Encott 200), but at other times they can be omitted so as to make a text more comprehensible for the addressee. For example, is it really necessary to use <b>multiple</b> <b>adjectives</b> such as “bad”, “severe”, “serious” within the same PIL or in several PILs, instead of using only one, perhaps the most common and understandable, for example the word “bad”...|$|R

This research intends to {{provide an overview of}} the theoretical assumptions in the studies of adjective phrases and a summary of prior work on the endangered Aslian languages namely Mah Meri. In this dissertation, the morphosyntactic properties of Mah Meri language are described by adopting the framework by Thorne (1993) and Chomsky (1993). It demonstrates that the adjective has grades and occurs as pre- and post- nominal modifiers of a noun phrase and becomes predicative to any subject in a sentence.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of comorbid persistent depressive and anxious symptoms in individuals with ischemic heart disease and to evaluate effects on mortality. Methods Prospective, longitudinal cohort design in the context of a randomized trial to decrease patient delay in seeking treatment for ischemic heart symptoms (PROMOTION trial) was used, with twelve-month follow-up of 2325 individuals with stable ischemic heart disease. Participants were assessed on enrollment and at 3 months using the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Adjective</b> Affect Checklist and the Brief Symptom Inventory for depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively. Results At 3 months, 608 individuals (61. 7 %) reported persistent symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both. Three hundred seventy-nine (42. 5 %) and 1056 (45. 4 %) had persistent anxious and depressive symptoms, respectively. Those with persistent, comorbid symptoms had higher mortality compared to others (p =. 029). The combined presence of anxious and depressive symptoms contributed significantly to mortality when compared to symptom-free participants (OR 2. 35, 95 % CI 1. 23 – 4. 47, p =. 010). The presence of persistent depressive symptoms only and persistent anxious symptoms only were not associated with death, when other demographic and clinical variables were considered.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{relationships between}} perceptual dimensions of percussive timbres and measurements produced by several signal analysis algorithms. The literature of psychophysical timbre experiments since 1941 is reviewed {{with respect to}} two contrasting approaches. The earliest attempts at unraveling the interdependent aspects of timbre perception employed <b>multiple</b> <b>adjective</b> scales intended to describe various sonic features. Following developments in the technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS) in the 1960 s, several researchers began to apply scaling techniques to data sets of timbre similarity judgments. At present, the majority of timbre studies are based on MDS. In spite of such advancements, the range of musical timbres has only begun to be explored from a perceptual viewpoint, and a significant gap exists in the literature for percussive instruments. The signal analysis algorithms employed in this research are introduced {{in the context of}} timbreID [...] a timbre analysis software library written by the author. The library's adaptability is illustrated with respect to several musical research applications in Pure data. This flexibility is shown to be beneficial in the case of two percussive instrument classification tests, in which the effectiveness of perceptually weighted spectral features like mel- and Bark-frequency spectrum are evaluated alongside other standard analysis techniques from the music information retrieval literature. In the final chapter, a perceptual experiment involving 30 diverse percussion timbres is carried out. The study confirms the importance of spectral centroid and attack duration as predictors of perceptual dimensions, and reveals two additional dimensions that may be unique to percussive timbres: "dryness" and "noisiness. " A predictive model is generated using multiple linear regression, and results indicate that the noisiness dimension cannot be predicted as accurately as dimensions relating to spectral center of gravity and attack time. Thus, there is a clear need for an effective measure of perceptual noisiness for accurate description of percussive timbr...|$|R
40|$|Which is more correct, the “big fat cat” or the “fat big cat?” Why is a {{particular}} order preferred? In English, established Phrase Structure rules place no limit {{on the number of}} adjectives before a noun. The adjectives, however, cannot occur in just any order, and native speakers of English have very particular intuitions about what order is more correct, even if they have never been explicitly taught ordering rules. In this study, I seek to describe the mechanics of an underlying adjective order in English and explore if the same principles operate cross-linguistically. After outlining some previous work across disciplines on the subject, I prove the existence of a preferred order using the results of searches from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and the British National Corpus. Additionally, I briefly discuss the prosodic differences between a given order and its alternative. Secondly, I develop a semantic theory that describes how pre-nominal adjectives are ordered based on their semantic properties, with adjectives that depict “intrinsic” properties closer to the noun, and adjectives that are “speaker relative” in a more distant position. In the theory, the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>adjectives</b> is described as being equivalent to a sequential series of restrictions placed on the set of properties for a given noun. This allows for a change in adjective order to affect {{the way in which we}} conceptualize of a noun, while also establishing an underlying order that is the most cognitively efficient. Lastly, I apply the theory to languages from different families, namely Italian, Sakha, Hebrew, and Welsh. My findings demonstrate that a uniquely semantic theory is successful in describing what native speakers perceive as the “proper” order of adjectives in a diverse group of languages...|$|R

In addition, {{this study examined the}} effects of confrontation on emotional arousal, emotional attributions and behavioral attributions after cheating or not cheating. The final subject pool consisted of 47 subjects who viewed cheating as a moral issue and 46 subjects who viewed cheating as a social-conventional issue. After filling out a self-report inventory of their current emotional arousal (the Emotional Assessment Inventory), all subjects were tempted to cheat on the Analogical Reasoning Task. Subjects then were given the Emotional Assessment Inventory again along with the <b>Multiple</b> Affect <b>Adjective</b> Check List (MAACL) {{to determine the effects of}} cheating or not cheating on emotional arousal. Afterwards subjects were divided into two confrontation groups, one set of subjects being told that the experimenter could identify who cheated or didn't cheat and one set being told that the experimenter could not identify their behavior. Subjects then were given the Emotional Assessment Inventory and <b>Multiple</b> Affect <b>Adjective</b> Check List again as well as the Attribution and Reasoning Questionnaire which assessed emotional and behavioral attributions for cheating or not cheating. Analysis of cheating behavior showed no difference between the two domain groups in terms of occurrence or amount of cheating or in terms of emotional reactions after cheating. However, after confrontation it was found that unidentifiable moral cheaters reported less undifferentiated arousal than any other group of subjects. This finding as well as the finding that subjects showed little affective change in terms of guilt, fear, and depression after cheating was discussed using self-deception theory. After cheaters were confronted, noncheaters showed a dramatic increase in the reported level of pride, contentedness, and self-confidence. In addition, noncheaters tended to concentrate on their behavior and claimed dispositional qualities were responsible for their actions, while cheaters tended to concentrate on situational variables. The lack of utility of domain of reasoning for predicting cheating behavior and emotional reactions after cheating may have resulted from a less than optimal assessment of domain of reasoning.

High sense of humor paticipants used humor to cope more than the low sense of humor participants in the sad video condition. The findings indicate that sense of humor is strongly related to depression, that depression levels can be reduced with a humor stimulus, and that those with a high sense of humor are more likely to use humor to cope with problems.

For example, although this patient cannot reliably recall three items in a serial recall task, he paradoxically shows exaggerated effects of proactive interference in short-term memory. However, this patient's difficulty with interference appears {{to be limited to}} tasks involving verbal stimuli [...] -other data show that patient ML performs normally on two nonverbal tasks that require resolution of interference. Experiment 2 attempted to identify ERP components related to proactive interference in one of the tasks administered in Experiment 1. This task, the recent negatives task, is a convenient measure of susceptibility to proactive interference. Moreover, Experiment 2 added an additional manipulation motivated by a unique effect discovered during the testing of patient ML (Hamilton, 2004), whereby the patient performed much better on the recent negatives task when repetition was minimized and the number of stimuli presented within the task were expanded. Two ERP components, a frontally distributed N 400 effect and parietally distributed late positive component (LPC), were found to respond to the manipulation of recency and repetition. Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 examined a language comprehension paradigm known to differentiate between patients with semantic and phonological short-term memory deficits. This task requires detection of semantic anomalies in phrases in which <b>multiple</b> <b>adjectives</b> appear before or after a noun [...] -multiple adjectives appearing before a noun are believed to place greater demands on semantic short-term memory relative to when adjectives appear after a noun. Thus, patients with semantic short-term memory deficits are especially poor at detecting anomalies in the before condition. Experiment 3 uses the parietally distributed N 400 as an indirect measure of short-term memory demands to corroborate behavioral and patient data. Relative to the "after" condition, the "before" condition did elicit smaller N 400 s, consistent with the idea that integration of adjectives in the before condition differs from integration in the after condition. Experiment 4 uses a modification of the sentence anomaly task employed in Experiment 3 to identify brain areas engaged in short-term maintenance of semantic representations. It was hypothesized that the before condition would produce greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region that has been related to short-term maintenance of semantic representations. Results from Experiment 4 are discussed in terms of the organization of maintenance and control processes important in semantic short-term memory. Finally, data from Experiments 1 [...] 4 are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of semantic short-term memory deficits and the associations of semantic short-term memory deficits with particular deficits of language comprehension and production...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{effects of}} a {{short-term}} Tai Chi exercise program for the elderly were evaluated in a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. This pilot study evaluated changes in flexibility, balance, sway, pain, and mood after a short slow-motion exer-cise. The program consisted {{of a series of}} movements involving turning, shifting weight, bending, and arm movements in combination with diaphragmatic breathing with slow movements. The measured effects included improved balance, sway, range of motion, decreased perceived pain, and lessened trait anxiety. Participants included 11 elderly females. Instruments consisted of standard goniometry, the <b>Multiple</b> Af-fect <b>Adjective</b> Check List, stopwatch measures of single-leg stance and a tandem walk (sway), and visual analog measurement of pain. Findings included significant im-provement (p =. 05) in trait anxiety and pain perception. Improvements in mood, flexibility, and balance may {{have a profound effect on}} the incidence of falls, injuries, resulting disability, and overall quality of life. As the percentage of the U. S. population grows older, holistic inter-ventions that prevent falls and their debilitating injuries are increas-ingly important. Many studies verify the age-related changes in the body that impair balance and strength as one grows older and thus place the elderly at an increased risk of falling (Green & Crouse, 1995...|$|R
