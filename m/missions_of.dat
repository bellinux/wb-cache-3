5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and fell into ruins.

40|$|A {{separation}} between the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> God and <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> the church occurred post Willingren 1952 through an introduction of the term and concept missio Dei.

A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three <b>missions</b> <b>of</b> Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education <b>missions</b> <b>of</b> Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E
