For example, {{in the white}} bear experiment, many general distractions in the environment (for instance a lamp, a light bulb, a desk etc.) might later serve as reminders of the object being suppressed (these are {{also referred to as}} [...] "free distraction").

This iterative process leaves the individual surrounded by retrieval cues, ultimately causing the rebound effect.

50|$|The domain {{specificity}} {{of these systems}} implies that the mental processes differ from the one system to the other. Compare, for instance, arithmetic operations in the quantitative system with mental rotation in the spatial system. The first require the thinker to relate quantities; the other require {{the transformation of the}} orientation of an object in space. Moreover, the different systems require different kinds of symbols to represent and operate on their objects. These differences make it difficult to equate the concepts and operations across the various systems in the <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> they impose on representational capacity, as the models above assume. Case also recognized that concepts and executive control structures differ across domains in the semantic networks that they involve. Case and Demetriou worked together to unify their analysis of domains. They suggested that Demetriou's domains may be specified in terms of Case's central conceptual structures.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} virtual {{fixtures}} {{was first introduced}} in (Rosenberg, 1992) as an overlay of virtual sensory information on a workspace {{in order to improve}} human performance in direct and remotely manipulated tasks. The virtual sensory overlays can be presented as physically realistic structures, registered in space such that they are perceived by the user to be fully present in the real workspace environment. The virtual sensory overlays can also be abstractions that have properties not possible of real physical structures. The concept of sensory overlays is difficult to visualize and talk about, as a consequence the virtual fixture metaphor was introduced. To understand what a virtual fixture is an analogy with a real physical fixture such as a ruler is often used. A simple task such as drawing a straight line {{on a piece of paper}} on free-hand is a task that most humans are unable to perform with good accuracy and high speed. However, the use of a simple device such as a ruler allows the task to be carried out fast and with good accuracy. The use of a ruler helps the user by guiding the pen along the ruler reducing the tremor and <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> of the user, thus increasing the quality of the task.|$|E
50|$|Pascual-Leone, Case, and Halford {{attempt to}} explain {{development}} along the sequence of Piagetian stages and substages. Pascual-Leone aligned this sequence with a single line of development of mental power that goes from one to seven mental units. Case suggested that each of four main stages involves different kinds of mental structures and he specified the <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> of the successive levels or substages of complexity {{within each of the}} main stages. He said that there may be different central conceptual structures within each level of executive control structures that differ between each other in reference to the concepts and semantic relations involved. Halford attempted to specify the cognitive load of the mental structure that is typical of each of the main stages. Fischer stressed the importance of skill construction processes in building stage-like constructs and he emphasized the role of the environment and social support in skill construction. Commons offered a description of the successive levels of cognitive development while allowing for the explicit reference to the particularities of concepts and operations specific to each of the domains. Demetriou integrated into his theory the constructs of speed of processing and control of processing, and he formulated the functional shift model, which unifies Pascual-Leone's notion of underlying common dimension of capacity development with the notion of qualitative changes in mental structure as development progresses along this dimension. Dynamic systems theory can model how different processes interact dynamically when developmental hierarachies are built.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} cope with mentally {{demanding}} situations and maintain cognitive functioning is a core requirement for airline pilots. Stress resistance is therefore an important selection criterion which is, however, difficult to assess. The main objective of this project was to enhance the assessment of stress resistance in pilot selection and to investigate the relationship between <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> and respiration as well as cardiac parameters. At the German Aerospace Center, the evaluation of stress resistance is currently based on observer ratings of visible strain symptoms and self-reports as well as performance measures. Since <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> has been shown to have clear effects on physiological systems, we investigated whether cardiorespiratory measures that can be obtained cheap and unobtrusively provide additional valuable information. While cardiac parameters have been studied extensively in response to <b>mental</b> <b>load,</b> little research has been devoted to the usefulness of respiratory measures – even though respiration is closely related to psychological processes under stress. Existing studies revealed that, on the one hand, respiratory reactivity might reflect <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> and, on the other hand, inappropriate changes might even cause performance decrements. However, further empirical evidence is needed to establish both findings. In a review study we integrated empirical findings on respiratory changes from baseline to mentally demanding task periods and possible effects of task difficulty and task duration. Based on the available studies, we found that mentally demanding episodes were characterized by faster breathing and higher minute ventilation, but that the respiratory amplitude was generally invariant to <b>mental</b> <b>load.</b> While total variability in respiratory rate was not systematically affected by <b>mental</b> <b>load,</b> we found that correlated variability was reduced. In addition, our analyses revealed that <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> may lead to overbreathing (decreased end-tidal carbon dioxide levels) and to higher oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Habituation effects were only reported for respiratory rate. Overall, this review showed that several respiratory measures are sensitive to <b>mental</b> <b>load.</b> Since most of the available studies were restricted to traditional time and volume parameters, we conducted an experimental study which also included variability and gas exchanges measures. The present experimental study was conducted on a sample of pilot candidates and aimed at investigating whether cardiorespiratory measures are sensitive to <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> as induced by a highly demanding multiple task that resembles the mental requirements of pilot selection and routine flight in a simplified way. We assessed heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, respiratory variability, and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide during baseline, task, and recovery periods. All measures changed clearly from baseline to task. Effects of recovery were observed for all measures besides end-tidal carbon dioxide. When analyzing associations with cognitive performance, small effects were found for respiratory measures, indicating that a more flexible system is related to higher cognitive performance. In addition, we investigated individual differences in personality and their associations with cardiorespiratory activation. While a lower cardiac reactivity was found in participants characterized by cognitive avoidant coping, respiratory rate was reduced in participants with higher levels of self-focused attention. Negative affectivity was not associated with cardiorespiratory activation but moderated the relationship of cardiac and self-reported arousal measures. Given that physiological and self-report measures of <b>mental</b> <b>load</b> are often combined when evaluating operator load, our results imply that an integration of individual differences may reduce unexplained variance. Taken together, the present experimental findings suggest that respiratory parameters would be a useful supplement to the current measures being used to assess stress resistance in pilot selection and that a consideration of trait characteristics may increase the validity of workload assessments. 1.
