This study also seeks to derive personal ecological explanations for variation in travel preference, travel intention and travel choice behavior {{of a wide range}} of destinations. Design/methodology/approach – A large representative sample of 49, 105 Australian respondents is utilized. Binary logistic regression is used to determine the impact of constraint variables.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of developing a <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> is to set the company on a specific path in marketing. The marketing goals normally aligns itself to the broader company objectives. For example, a new company looking to grow their business will generally have a <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> that emphasizes strategies to increase their customer base. Acquiring marketing share, increasing customer awareness, and building a favorable business image {{are some of the}} objectives that can be related to <b>marketing</b> <b>planning.</b> The <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> also helps layout the necessary budget and resources needed to achieve the goals stated in the <b>marketing</b> <b>plan.</b> The <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> shows what the company is intended to accomplish within the budget and also {{to make it possible for}} company executives to assess potential return on the investment of marketing dollars. Different aspects of the <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> relate to accountability. The <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> is a general responsibility from company leaders and the marketing staff to take the company in a specific direction. After the strategies are laid out and the tasks are developed, each task is assigned to a person or a team for implementation. The assigned roles allows companies to keep track of their milestones and communicate with the teams during the implementation process. Having a <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> helps company leaders to develop and keep an eye on the expectations for their functional areas. For example, if a company's <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> goal is to increase sales growth then the company leaders may have to increase their sales staff in stores to help generate more sales.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> has received considerable attention {{over the last}} decades. However, the traditional, synoptic approach predominates in the existing literature. Empirical research on behavioural aspects of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process is still scarce {{although there are some}} important theoretical achievement within the behavioural approach. This paper aims to fill in this gap by addressing the problem of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> system structure and relationships between its elements. The conceptual framework for our empirical model of firm’s <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> system is grounded on theoretical assumptions originated from both traditional, synoptic as well as behavioural perspectives. Our empirical assessment, conducted in 101 large Polish companies, reveals the existence of significant correlations between analytical dimension of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> (i. e. comprehensiveness, information and formalization) and its behavioural aspects (participation and attitudes). Our findings also prove that <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process has impact on ultimate marketing effects (firm’s market orientation and performance). This paper contributes to the field of marketing management (particularly to its effectiveness stream) and supports the notion on manageability of both analytical and behavioural dimensions of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process...|$|R
