5000|$|A famous {{example of}} the dilemma in {{defining}} music is modern composer John Cage’s composition titled 433. The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only <b>mark</b> <b>sections</b> and the <b>end</b> by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered [...] "musical" [...] and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over {{the organization of the}} sounds heard [...] Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form [...]|$|R

30|$|The {{regressive}} phase commenced {{after the}} Late Permian <b>section,</b> <b>marking</b> the <b>end</b> of the Palaeozoic tectonic activity (Mory 1991). This phase produced thick, siliciclastic–carbonate Triassic section facies {{that cover the}} Vulcan sub-basin, Londonderry High and Ashmore Platform (Cadman and Temple 2003). Beginning in the Scythian, the Mount Goodwin interval was deposited with interbedded claystones and minor siltstone–limestones. Following the Mount Goodwin intervals, shallow Anisian Pollard marine carbonate and shoreline mixed with siliciclastic–carbonates of the Carnian–Ladinian Challis interval exhibit complex shallow marine facies, and both intervals {{have the potential to}} serve as good reservoirs (Cadman and Temple 2003). Based on log reports, the Pollard interval consists of mudstones with some claystones, while the Challis interval is more sand-prone with interbedded claystones and limestone intercalations.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of trade}} marks in keyword {{advertising}} {{has been one}} of the ‘hottest’ issues in intellectual property law for several years. This entirely new way of using trade marks as a targeting tool has provoked a discussion concerning the core concepts of trade mark law. This chapter discusses the issues of ‘trade <b>mark</b> use’ (<b>section</b> 5), the likelihood of confusion test (section 6), the protected functions of a trade <b>mark</b> (<b>section</b> 7), the protection of reputable <b>marks</b> (<b>section</b> 8), and the limitations to trade <b>mark</b> rights (<b>section</b> 9) in the context of keyword advertising. First, this paper will illuminate the functioning of keyword advertising and the various interests at stake (section 2). Thereafter, the structure of Art 5 TMD, as well as the underlying rationales and policy concerns of trade mark law will be addressed (sections 3 and 4). In addition to trade mark law, unfair competition law issues will briefly be pointed out (section 10). Furthermore, a number of national court decisions applying the guidance provided by the ECJ will be analyzed (section 11). The chapter concludes by arguing an approach towards the use of trade marks in keyword advertising which takes into account the freedoms of information and competition and which focuses on the prevention of consumer confusion (section 12) ...|$|R
