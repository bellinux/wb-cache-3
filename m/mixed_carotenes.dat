40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of lycopene and beta-carotene on pneumonia among children. Forty infant and child aged 6 to 36 months suffer from pneumonia and admitted Bab El-Shaareya Hospital for treatment were selected for this study. The children divided into four equal groups; control group (CG), beta carotene group (BCG), lycopene group (LYG) and mixture (lycopene+beta-carotene) group (MG). All subjects were received hospital meal without any modification, while BCG received 15 mg/day of beta carotene; LYG received 15 mg/day of lycopene and MG received 7. 5 mg/day lycopene + 7. 5 mg/day beta carotene. All groups received hospital meal in addition to tested carotenoid that dissolved in orange juice. The intervention period continued for 14 consecutive days. The respiratory rate (RR) and temperature were measured daily till recovery. Also, WBCs, IgE and IgG were determined at admission and after intervention period. Results showed that RR of MG and LYG groups returned normal after 21. 6 ± 7. 2 and 26. 4 ± 10. 4 hours respectively at P< 0. 05, while CG recovered after 37. 2 ± 13. 6 hours. Moreover, administration of lycopene decreased RR significantly (P< 0. 05) by 37. 6 %, while administration of beta carotene or the mixture resulted in decrement of RR by 33. 4 % and 28. 4 % respectively. Also, the administration of lycopene reduced IgE significantly (P< 0. 05) by 63. 7 %, followed by the mixture that reduced it by 40. 7 % (P< 0. 05). In conclusion the administration of lycopene alone or <b>mixed</b> with beta <b>carotene</b> had a favorable affect on recovery of pneumoni...|$|R
40|$|Spinach is a {{well known}} {{vegetable}} {{as a source of}} nutrition especially for is carotene. Soinach leaves need to be dried for application in product development of food like biscuit, extruded products and analysis. One the drying method that became popular is drying using infrared wave. The aim of this research was to compare the effect of blanching and drying (far infrared dryer, oven vacuum, and freeze dryer) on the color, total carotene, beta-carotene, and vitamin C of spinach leaves. Blanching and drying of increased brightness, a value, and b value. The a value is shows spinach brightness in mix red-green color while b value shows <b>mix</b> blue-yellow. Total <b>carotene</b> of fresh spinach decreased by 10. 47 % after blanching. Drying with vacuum decreased the total carotene by 39. 31 % (with blanching) and 31. 66 (with blanching). Drying with freeze dryer decreased the beta carotene by 4. 99 % (with blanching) and 18. 60 % (with blanching). Drying with FIR dryer decreased spinach total carotene by 34. 90 % (with blanching) and 24. 86 % (with blanching). The beta-carotene of fresh spinach with balancing treatment decreased of by 16. 53 %. drying oven vacuum decreased the beta carotene by 42. 80 % (wiyh blanching) and 18. 91 % (with blanching). Drying with freeze dyer decreased the beta carotene by 29. 03 % (with blanching) the beta carotene. The decreased of beta-carotene is bigger than total carotene. Vitamin C of fresh spinach decreased by 20. 35 % after blanching. Drying with oven vacuum decreased of 55. 77 % (without blanching) and 65. 42 % (with blanching) f the vitamin C. drying with freeze dryer decreased the vitamin C by 13. 21 % (without blanching) and 30. 67 % (with blanching). Meanwhile, the vitamin C of spinach after drying with FIR dyer decreased of 60. 53 % (without blanching) and 70. 29 % (with blanching) ...|$|R
