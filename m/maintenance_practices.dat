5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} poor results of XXIBomber Command's {{precision}} bombing campaign. The {{most important of}} these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe weather fronts between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXIBomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 <b>maintenance</b> <b>practices</b> and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of launching and recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.|$|E

The Wadala depot was equipped for the maintenance of 300 buses. At this time it was the largest depot in Asia. After this, taking long maintenance experience into account, the authorities decided that no depot should be called on to look after more than 125 to 150 buses. Accordingly, small depots were built at convenient spots in the city and its suburbs. Every depot is another work center, which provides bus services effectively on every day, carries out preventive maintenance as well as repairs on buses.

Air conditioning in 22 of the city's 94 ambulances broke down in June 2013. To provide adequate coverage at events at the Verizon Center and at Nationals Park (home of Major League Baseball's Washington Nationals), DCFEMS hired two private companies (American Medical Response and Lifestar Ambulance Service). The cost of the outsourcing could not be estimated. Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Paul Quander {{said there was no}} emergency, and that the city would spend several weeks evaluating the situation first. During the weekend of July 19–21, only 37 ambulances were available—forcing DCFEMS to send 16 ambulances for repair at the District of Columbia Department of Public Works and another six to the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. DCFEMS announced on July 23, 2013, that it had hired an auditor at the cost of $180,000 to examine its fleet <b>maintenance</b> <b>practices,</b> and that the delivery of 13 new ambulances in August would alleviate the problem with breakdowns.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, State Senator John Bonacic of Mount Hope began {{drafting}} {{legislation to}} halt the planned transfer of maintenance of I-84. Bonacic asserted that the Thruway Authority had better <b>maintenance</b> <b>practices</b> than NYSDOT, most notably {{in the field of}} snow removal. He also claimed that the DOT lacked the time and money needed to match the quality of maintenance that NYSTA performed on I-84. The senator eventually prevailed as the 2007–2008 budget was modified to allocate additional funding to NYSDOT, which would then pay the Thruway Authority to maintain I-84. A formal agreement between the two agencies was reached on September19. The one-year agreement cost NYSDOT $11.5million and took effect October30, the date I-84 was to become DOT-maintained. The agreement was renewed in April 2008 at a cost of $10.3million, extending the arrangement through October31, 2009. It remained in place until October11, 2010, when NYSDOT re-assumed maintenance of the highway. The change was made in the 2010–2011 state budget in an effort to reduce the cost of maintaining I-84. Governor David Paterson—who included the change in the budget—expected that the state would save $3.9million annually on maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|Superelevation {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and <b>maintenance</b> <b>practices,</b> as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum cross slope of 6 to 8%. While steeper cross slope makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower cross slope increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed skidding is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves have the benefit of greater net safety when designers select up to 8% superelevation, instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E

Consequences of system failure can exceed mere monetary penalties to include the well being of staff. From an engineering education perspective, rapid development in technology in parallel with the evolution of traditional engineering disciplines, necessitates the utilization of innovative ways to teach non-traditional or interdisciplinary topics like maintenance. Another challenge in this context, is the ability to allocate time and physical resources in ever more condensed engineering curricula whilst making the learning process engaging for students. This paper details a recent trial to teach a short undergraduate course on maintenance within a mechanical engineering degree where students also look at some safety considerations associated with <b>maintenance</b> <b>practice.</b> A combined Problem Based Learning/Experiential Learning approach applied to machine tool maintenance was adopted using resources readily available in most engineering schools...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2012, a local {{newspaper}} Philipstown.Info revealed that the Town of Philipstown budget contained proposed expenditures for paving sections of the town's historic dirt roads [...] including 5300 feet of Old Albany Post Road in 2013-14 and an additional 7580 feet to be paved within 5 years. Until the paper revealed this information, residents of the road were unaware of the town's grand plans. The Philipstown Board cited three reasons for paving; the cost of maintaining dirt roads are too expensive, degradation of water quality in nearby streams, and safety. If this plan were undertaken the Old Albany Post Road would lose almost 2.5 miles of historic road. Sections that the town wants to pave include two important historic areas; Saunders Farm and the hill that runs north to the famous revolutionary era Bird and Bottle Inn. There is considerable opposition to paving by local residents and a contentious town board workshop was held for Philipstown residents on January 16, 2013. Those in opposition to paving cite the historic, aesthetic, cultural, and recreational importance of leaving the road untouched. Many residents and an expert engineer presented information documenting that sound dirt road <b>maintenance</b> <b>practices</b> have not been utilized by the Town of Philipstown {{and if they were}} adopted would lead to cost savings, improvement in water quality, and thus preserve the historic nature of the road. Additionally other dirt road residents pointed out that drivers on dirt roads travel at significantly lower speeds reducing mortality in pedestrian vehicle accidents. It was also pointed out that the Town of Philipstown could be in violation of state bonding laws if they were to pave as proposed with merely a thin coat of asphalt and no substructure preparation.|$|E
