After a decade playing in the First and Second Divisions, <b>Mallender</b> dropped down into non-league football to play for Hereford United; one of the leading clubs in the Southern League. In doing so, he went part-time and secured a full-time job as a sales representative for Cadbury.|$|R

5000|$|Kenneth [...] "Ken" [...] <b>Mallender</b> (born 10 December 1943) is an English retired footballer {{who played}} during the 1960s and early 1970s. He played as a {{left-sided}} defender.|$|R

25|$|<b>Mallender</b> spent ten {{consecutive}} seasons (1983-84 to 1992-93) playing for Otago in New Zealand, {{for whom he}} became something of a local. He captained the side for two years (1990–91, 1991–92) and generally revelled in the New Zealand conditions, always featuring {{near the top of}} the bowling averages. He took over 250 first-class wickets, at a touch over 20 apiece, as well as scoring his only first-class century in 1991-92 against Central Districts. His efforts helped Otago (traditionally one of New Zealand domestic cricket’s bridesmaids) win the Shell Trophy twice during his stay. As a consequence <b>Mallender</b> was awarded the rare honour, to a foreigner, of a testimonial.|$|R
5000|$|George's fresh {{legs were}} to pay {{dividends}} minutes {{later when he}} won possession on the Hereford left, turned well and found <b>Mallender.</b> <b>Mallender's</b> long ball was headed on by Billy Meadows and was not fully cleared. In the midfield Ronnie Radford challenged Tudor for the loose ball, won it and played a one-two with Brian Owen. The return pass bobbled on the muddy surface but sat up kindly for Radford who unleashed a , strike that, {{in the words of}} commentator Motson, [...] "flew into the top corner of McFaul's net". The memorable scenes that followed saw a pitch invasion by many Parka-clad spectators, to be endlessly replayed for years to come.|$|R
50|$|Four {{candidates}} were successfully {{nominated for the}} election for Deputy Leader, these being Caroline Allen, a vet from Islington, London; Will Duckworth, a Dudley local councilor; Richard <b>Mallender,</b> a Nottingham local councilor; and Alexandra Phillips, a Brighton and Hove local Councilor.|$|R

2500|$|Chief Executive Chris <b>Mallender</b> stated: [...] "The {{council is}} {{doing the right thing}} by {{reaching}} the decision in public. We will be starting the meeting at 6pm so we can give the opportunity for [...] to speak," [...] a move he said would make sure councillors' decisions reflected public opinion.|$|R
25|$|The {{overcast}} sky and seaming pitch made {{the selection of}} England's nearly-man Neil <b>Mallender</b> for his debut look inspired. England's all-seam attack rattled through the Pakistani batting, with only Salim Malik putting up any resistance, though he ended up stranded on 82 despite useful support from Mushtaq Ahmed that spared the tourists' blushes (they added 64 for the ninth wicket).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mallender</b> {{was born}} in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, but spent {{the early part of}} his {{childhood}} in Somerset, before moving to Lincolnshire, where he attended Bourne Grammar School, showing himself as a natural sportsman in cricket and football.

50|$|On April 18, 2013 it was {{announced}} that Gruber had joined the band Raven Lord. He was to replace Jamie <b>Mallender</b> for the bassist's position.

2500|$|The {{settlement}} was mediated by retired judge Sir Henry Brooke. Before settlement had been reached, Chris <b>Mallender</b> explained: [...] "We {{have reached a}} view {{that there are going}} to be no outright winners in this.

50|$|In the 1973-74 season, <b>Mallender</b> scored {{his fourth}} and final Football League goal, in his last season for Hereford.

5000|$|On April 18, 2013, it was {{announced}} that Craig Gruber was to replace Jamie <b>Mallender</b> for the bassist's position. However, Gruber departed the band shortly thereafter and was replaced by Lucio Manca. In June 2013, the band played summer shows in the United Kingdom followed by the R-Mine Metalfest 2013 festival in Belgium. Their second single, [...] "Fighting for Freedom", was released on June 22, 2013. On August 2, 2013, Claudio Tirincanti became the band's official drummer.|$|R
2500|$|On 16 April 2010 {{the council}} {{released}} {{a joint statement}} with the families' solicitors announcing it was dropping its appeal and had agreed a financial settlement with 19 families. Chris <b>Mallender</b> said: [...] "The council recognises that it made mistakes in its clean-up of the former British Steel site years ago and extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families. Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities {{and for all that}} they have suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology coupled with today's agreement will mean that they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty." [...] The financial terms of the settlement remained confidential, and the agreement forbids disclosure of the financial arrangements. On the subject of cost, <b>Mallender</b> said: [...] "Every £1m of cost involves a payment £5 per household in Corby on average, per year, for the next 20 years. So, simple maths: if the overall bill is £5m, it's £25 per household for 20 years." ...|$|R
50|$|Jamie joined Raven Lord in August 2011. He {{performs}} on {{the debut}} album Descent to the Underworld. On 15 April 2013, Jamie made a VLOG {{to make it}} clear to fans that he had decided to leave the band purely for creative reasons {{and that there was no}} bad feeling towards the band. He also announced plans to record new solo material and form new musical alliances. On 18 April 2013 it was announced that Jamie <b>Mallender</b> was replaced by Craig Gruber for the bassist's position.|$|R
50|$|Tyler {{had another}} chance saved at the near post {{from the edge}} of the area, as the non-leaguers made a good start to the second half. With Newcastle on the back foot somewhat, Hereford won a corner which found Ken <b>Mallender</b> at the back post. However the Hereford defender saw his header rebound off the post which Alan Jones then hit just wide. At the other end Newcastle won a corner {{themselves}} with Macdonald's bullet header destined for the corner of the Hereford goal. However Potter dived across to make another great save.|$|R
2500|$|Corby Borough Council's Chief Executive Chris <b>Mallender</b> said: [...] "We are {{obviously}} very disappointed and very {{surprised at the}} outcome of this trial. Our position has always been that there was no link between the reclamation work that was carried out in Corby in past decades and these children's birth defects. That is still our position." [...] He also said they were [...] "prepared to apologise for mistakes that had been made but could not apologise until a causal link was proved between the works and the defects... We are not yet at the point of saying sorry because nobody yet is responsible." ...|$|R
50|$|Green Left was {{launched}} on 4 June 2006 {{by members of}} the Green Party of England and Wales. Those who supported the group included various members of the Green Party of England and Wales Executive, including Richard <b>Mallender</b> (Chair), Peter Cranie (elections co-ordinator) and Siân Berry (at that time one of the two principal speakers, and campaigns coordinator), as well as Penny Kemp (former party chair), Joseph Healy (Secretary, London Green Party), Derek Wall (writer, and at that time the other principal speaker) and Peter Tatchell (human rights activist). Cllr Sarah Farrow and Cllr Matt Sellwood were elected as the co-conveners of the new group.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mallender</b> {{proved to}} be a good selection, bowling with {{controlled}} swing and pace and able to lure the Pakistan batsmen, unfamiliar with the conditions, into rash strokes. He returned 5 for 50 in the second innings and 8 for 122 in the match to help England square the series 11. [...] He retained his place for the fifth Test at The Oval, where he opened the bowling, but took only two lower-order wickets in the match, which Pakistan won decisively. [...] He was then not selected for the winter tour to Sri Lanka and India, and never played Test cricket again. He had a Test bowling average of 10 wickets at 21.50.|$|R
