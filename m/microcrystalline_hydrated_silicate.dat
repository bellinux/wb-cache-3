40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that some of}} the surface features of Europa may be due to processes occurring within a planet in which <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates</b> are stable. Based on considerations of the mechanical properties of <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates</b> and ice and the likely thickness of the ice crust (less than 24 km), models are developed for the long, relatively dark lineaments that lie on great and small circles and frequently possess bright medial stripes, and for the complex network of fractures surrounded by cuspate ridges in the antijovian region. The global-scale lineaments are explained in terms of planetary expansion brought about by positive volume changes resulting from the dehydration of the <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates.</b> The apparently tensile features in the antijovian region are attributed to a region of upwelling in the convecting anhydrous silicate interior surrounded by a region of return flow beneath the <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicate</b> mantle...|$|R

40|$|Observational {{testing of}} the idea that the {{distribution}} of water is the key to understanding the volatile content of the asteroid belt relies on the exploration of the 3 micron absorption feature in <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates</b> - the only diagnostic spectral band evident in the dark, volatile rich CI and CM meteorites. The existence of the band has demonstrated the presence of <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates</b> on asteroids. An example of this feature is shown in the spectrum of the CI meteorite Orgueil. The feature is characterized by a sharp reflectance drop at 2. 7 microns, due to structural OH, and by an absorption due to H 2 O that decreases slowly out to about 3. 5 microns. In their present observational program, researchers are expanding their observational program to include other low-albedo classes of asteroids - asteroids that range primarily from the middle and outer asteroid belt (greater than 2. 5 AU) to the Trojan region at 5. 2 AU.

40|$|This study {{consisted}} of a comprehensive laboratory and telescopic investigation of H₂O distribution among the low-albedo, outer belt asteroids (2. 5 - 5. 2 AU). The water distribution was determined by surveying asteroids for the 3 -μm molecular H₂O and structural OH ion absorption, the spectral signature of meteorite and asteroid <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates.</b> Survey results were interpreted using the mid-infrared (2. 5 - 25 μm) reflectance spectra of 16 carbonaceous chondrites and other likely asteroidal materials. The 19 asteroids observed in this program, augmented by earlier reflectance data, yielded 3 -μm band depth measurements that reflect the present outer belt H₂O distribution. Of the 32 C-class asteroids in this sample, 66 % have <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicate</b> surfaces, indicating a mild aqueous alteration episode early in solar system history. Strictly speaking, the C class is thus not a primitive asteroid group, but the anhydrous objects appear little altered, as do the P and D asteroid classes beyond 3. 5 AU. In addition to this pronounced difference in hydration state among the outer belt classes, the C region shows a gradual decline in <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicate</b> abundance from 2. 5 to 3. 5 AU. This trend, coupled with the apparently anhydrous P and D surfaces, is consistent with an original outer belt asteroid composition of anhydrous silicates, water ice, and complex organic material. Early solar wind induction heating of proto-asteroids declined in intensity with heliocentric distance, and produced the observed radial decrease in <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicate</b> abundance. The mild thermal processing of the outer belt {{is a continuation of}} the intense heating and differentiation episode that occurred sunward of 2. 5 AU, and both events support the induction heating mechanism.

40|$|Sugar {{molecules}} adsorbed at hydrated inorganic oxide surfaces occur ubiquitously {{in nature}} and in technologically important materials and processes, including marine biomineralization, cement hydration, corrosion inhibition, bioadhesion, and bone resorption. Among these examples, surprisingly diverse hydration behaviors are observed for oxides {{in the presence of}} saccharides with closely related compositions and structures. Glucose, sucrose, and maltodextrin, for example, exhibit significant differences in their adsorption selectivities and alkaline reaction properties on <b>hydrating</b> aluminate, <b>silicate,</b> and aluminosilicate surfaces that are shown to be due to the molecular architectures of the saccharides. Solid-state 1 H, 13 C, 29 Si, and 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements, including at very high magnetic fields (19  T), distinguish and quantify the different molecular species, their chemical transformations, and their site-specific adsorption on different aluminate and silicate moieties. Two-dimensional NMR results establish nonselective adsorption of glucose degradation products containing carboxylic acids on both <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicates</b> and aluminates. In contrast, sucrose adsorbs intact at <b>hydrated</b> <b>silicate</b> sites and selectively at anhydrous, but not hydrated, aluminate moieties. Quantitative surface force measurements establish that sucrose adsorbs strongly as multilayers on hydrated aluminosilicate surfaces. The molecular structures and physicochemical properties of the saccharides and their degradation species correlate well with their adsorption behaviors. The results explain the dramatically different effects that small amounts of different types of sugars have on the rates at which aluminate, silicate, and aluminosilicate species hydrate, with important implications for diverse materials and applications...|$|R

We report the presence of zeolites and phyllosilicates like prehnite, Mg-chlorite, Mg-rich smectites and mixed-layer chlorites-smectites and chlorite-vermiculite from comparison of hyperspectral infrared observations with laboratory spectra. These minerals are associated with fresh craters post-dating any aqueous activity. They likely represent ancient hydrated terrains excavated by the crater-forming impacts, and hence reveal the composition of the altered Noachian crust, although crater-related hydrothermal activity may have played a minor role for the largest craters (> 20 km in diameter). Most detected minerals formed over relatively high temperatures (100 - 300 °C), likely due to aqueous alteration of the Noachian crust by regional low grade metamorphism from the Noachian thermal gradient and/or by extended hydrothermal systems associated with Noachian volcanism and ancient large impact craters. This is in contrast with some other phyllosilicate-bearing regions like Mawrth Vallis where smectites, kaolinites and hydrated silica were mainly identified, pointing to a predominance of surface/shallow sub-surface alteration; and where excavation by impacts played only a minor role.
