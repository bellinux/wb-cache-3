5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E
5|$|In a 1997 {{restaurant}} listing {{published by}} the English-language daily The Jakarta Post, which largely caters to expatriates and middle class Indonesians, at least 80 locations within the city can be considered Chinese out of the 10-page list. Additionally, major hotels generally operate one or two Chinese restaurants, and many <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in large shopping centers. Upscale Chinese restaurants in Jakarta, where the urban character of the ethnic Chinese is well established, can be found serving delicacies such as shark fin soup and bird's nest soup. Food considered to have healing properties, including ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, are in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E

5|$|Little <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said of Padarn, {{though he}} later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed {{details of his}} life. He {{may have been more}} closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{enclosure}} {{is known}} as Fort St-Georges, the central is the Château du Milieu (the middle castle), while the westernmost {{is known as}} the Fort du Coudray. The Fort St-George was built under HenryII and contained a chapel dedicated England's patron saint. The Château du Coudray was added by PhilipII in the early 13thcentury, while the Château de Milieu was built in the 12th and 14thcenturies. The round Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII (which has parallels at Dourdan, Falaise, Gisors, Laon, and Lillebonne) guarded the bridge linking the Fort du Coudray and the Château de Milieu. While the curtain wall stands in many places, the buildings within the château do not survive to the same extent, and in many cases little <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said about them than the location of their foundations and possible use.|$|E
5|$|This article {{compares the}} {{properties}} of brains across {{the entire range of}} animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.

5|$|Halo Wars 2 {{features}} {{a number of}} multiplayer modes that can be played online with up to six players. Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents. Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army. Stronghold and Domination are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map. Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment. Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card {{features a}} unit that is deployed on the battlefield. Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> collected as additional energy supplies are dropped onto the map periodically. There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.|$|E

25|$|The most {{vulnerable}} {{section of the}} cable is where it is clamped {{to the end of}} an insulator string, so dampers are typically installed at the nearest anti-nodes (points of maximum displacement) either side of the clamp. There are thus normally two dampers per span, though <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> installed if necessary on longer spans.|$|E

25|$|The game {{features}} multiplayer {{with support}} {{for up to}} four players simultaneously. This mode starts off very limited, {{with only a few}} playable characters, weapons, items, and maps; but many <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> unlocked by either playing a certain number of multiplayer games or achieving certain accomplishments in-game. Players are able to fight on foot or in a vehicle (a Landmaster, Arwing, or Wolfen), though some stages prohibit certain modes of travel.

25|$|Open {{clusters}} are key {{objects in}} the study of stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, their properties (such as distance, age, metallicity and extinction) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye. Some others, such as the Double Cluster, are barely perceptible without instruments, while many <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen using binoculars or telescopes. The Wild Duck Cluster, M11, is an example.|$|E

25|$|Both {{approaches}} use {{the observation}} that in claw-free graphs, no vertex can have more than two neighbors in an independent set, and so the symmetric difference of two independent sets must induce a subgraph of degree at most two; that is, it is a union of paths and cycles. In particular, if I is a non-maximum independent set, it differs from any maximum independent set by even cycles and so called augmenting paths: induced paths which alternate between vertices not in I and vertices in I, and for which both endpoints have only one neighbor in I. As the symmetric difference of I with any augmenting path gives a larger independent set, the task thus reduces to searching for augmenting paths until no <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found, analogously as in algorithms for finding maximum matchings.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added onto the controller {{to give the}} player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers {{are trying to make}} the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable {{in the hands of the}} consumer.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{humans are}} asked to choose a password, {{sometimes}} guided by suggestions or restricted {{by a set of}} rules, when creating a new account for a computer system or Internet Web site. Only rough estimates of strength are possible, since humans tend to follow patterns in such tasks, and those patterns can usually assist an attacker. In addition, lists of commonly chosen passwords are widely available for use by password guessing programs. Such lists include the numerous online dictionaries for various human languages, breached databases of plaintext and hashed passwords from various online business and social accounts, along with other common passwords. All items in such lists are considered weak, as are passwords that are simple modifications of them. For some decades, investigations of passwords on multi-user computer systems have shown that 40% or more are readily guessed using only computer programs, and <b>more</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found when information about a particular user is taken into account during the attack.|$|E
