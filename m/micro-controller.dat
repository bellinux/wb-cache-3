2500|$|The Motorola 6809 was {{originally}} produced in 1 MHz, 1.5MHz (68A09) and 2MHz (68B09) speed ratings. Faster versions were produced later by Hitachi. It is sometimes {{considered to be}} the conceptual precursor of the Motorola 68000 family of processors, though this is mostly a misunderstanding. The 6809 and 68000 design projects ran partly in parallel and have quite differing architectures as well as radically different implementation principles. However, there {{is a certain amount of}} design philosophy similarity (e.g., considerable orthogonality and flexible addressing modes), some assembly language syntax resemblance, as well as opcode mnemonic similarity, but the 6809 is a derivative of the 6800 whereas the 68000 was a totally new design. An 8-bit data bus version of the 68000 (i.e., the 68008) was intended for use in future 8-bit designs. With little to improve the 6809 marks the end of the evolution of Motorola's 8 bit processors. A [...] <b>micro-controller</b> version with a slightly modified instruction set, the 6811, was discontinued as late as the second decade of the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|<b>Micro-controllers</b> such as Arduino {{are widely}} used by all kinds of makers worldwide.

The last decade has witnessed a surge of software engineering solutions for “the Internet of Things”, but in several cases these solutions require computational resources that are more advanced than simple, resource-limited <b>micro-controllers.</b> Surprisingly, in spite of being the basic ingredients of complex hardware–software systems, there {{does not seem to be}} a simple and flexible way to (1) extend the basic capabilities of <b>micro-controllers,</b> and (2) to coordinate inter-connected <b>micro-controllers</b> in “the Internet of Things”.
