25|$|Simple logic {{circuits}} interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This incremental rotary encoder scheme {{is sometimes called}} quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately quadrature phase. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the <b>mouse</b> <b>cable,</b> directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.|$|E
50|$|A mouse bungee is made {{of plastic}} and metal {{fabricated}} tools, in which a computer <b>mouse</b> <b>cable</b> is clamped. It prevents tangling of the cable, while providing full freedom of movement. They are mostly used by gamers, especially {{in the field of}} e-Sports.|$|E

50|$|KVM {{switches}} offer {{different methods}} of connecting the computers. Depending on the product, the switch may present native connectors on the device where standard keyboard, monitor and <b>mouse</b> <b>cables</b> can be attached. Another method {{to have a}} single DB25 or similar connector that aggregated connections at the switch with three independent keyboard, monitor and <b>mouse</b> <b>cables</b> to the computers. Subsequently, these were replaced by a special KVM cable which combined the keyboard, video and <b>mouse</b> <b>cables</b> in a single wrapped extension cable. The advantage of the last approach is in {{the reduction of the}} number of cables between the KVM switch and connected computers. The disadvantage is the cost of these cables.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Pro Mouse {{was available}} only in black, which matched the black Apple Pro Keyboard. The cord on the original Apple Pro Mouse had a very high failure rate due to flexing and corrosion. It wasn't until later that the <b>mouse</b> <b>cable</b> was available in white with the debut of the Power Mac G4 MDD, a revision which also solved reliability problems with a more rugged cord and improved stress relief. In May 2003, the mouse and keyboard were both re-designed, though {{the exterior of the}} mouse had few noticeable changes: Apple dropped the [...] "Pro" [...] from the name, and removed the ability to control the firmness of click in the Apple Mouse. From then on, the Pro Mouse was simply known as [...] "Apple Mouse." [...] This white mouse was later included with Power Mac G4 Mirror Drive Door systems, Power Mac G5 systems, the eMac, and iMac G3, G4 and G5.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} mouse is {{an input device}} that is most often used with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Today, many computer mice use wired and wireless technology and have no wire. This Dual Function Mouse developed caused by problems faced by computer mice's users while using the existing device where, the wireless mouse's batteries run out of power accidently {{in the middle of}} their activities. Moreover, they need to stop their work or activities and spend money to buy new batteries. It will caused more money spend in a long term period. Besides that, wired mouse's users need to purchase a new wired mouse when the <b>mouse's</b> <b>cable</b> gets broken. Accordingly the problem statement, Dual Function Mouse developed to improve the quality and users performance in doing their activities such as doing work, playing computer games, and so on...|$|R
25|$|To {{transmit}} their input, typical <b>cabled</b> <b>mice</b> use a thin {{electrical cord}} terminating {{in a standard}} connector, such as RS-232C, PS/2, ADB or USB. Cordless mice instead transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.|$|R
50|$|Local remote KVM device design {{allows users}} to control {{computer}} equipment up to 1000 ft away from the user consoles (keyboard, monitor and mouse). They always need direct cable connection from the computer to the KVM switch to the console and include support for standard category 5 cabling between computers and users interconnected by the switch device. In contrast, USB powered KVM devices are able to control computer equipment {{using a combination of}} USB, keyboard, <b>mouse</b> and monitor <b>cables</b> of up to 5 m.|$|R
50|$|The mouse bungee {{consists}} of a wide, stable base plate with non-slip bottom and a crane-like, oblique, sprung clamp for the cable, which rises about 10 cm high. In plastic frames a stabilization weight is incorporated, which ensures the necessary weight. Ideally, it {{is in front of}} the <b>Mouse</b> and the <b>cable</b> length is manually set so that the entire mouse pad can be easily reached with the mouse, but does not create unnecessary loops or loops in the cable. The back of the cable remains lying quiet and safe on the table without causing an annoyance.|$|R
25|$|M0100: Four {{months after}} the Macintosh debut, the Apple IIc was {{introduced}} {{with the addition of}} an optional mouse to manipulate standard 80 column text. The mouse was similar to the Macintosh mouse, though it was in a creamy-beige color that co-ordinated with the IIc's bright off-white case and had a slightly modified design which was sleeker than the Macintosh's blockier shape. It also was uniformly the same color, eliminating the Mac & Lisa's contrasting taupe accents on the <b>mouse</b> button and <b>cable.</b> Unlike the Macintosh, the IIc Mouse shared a dual purpose port with gaming devices like joysticks. In order for the IIc to know what was plugged into it, its mouse had to send the appropriate signal. Despite these differences, it carried exactly the same model number as the Macintosh version.|$|R
40|$|Infection by Burkholderia cenocepacia in cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients {{is associated with}} poor clinical prognosis. Previously, we demonstrated {{that one of the}} highly transmissible strains, BC 7, expresses cable pili and the associated 22 kDa adhesin, both of which contribute to BC 7 binding to airway epithelial cells. However, the contribution of these factors to induce inflammation and bacterial persistence in vivo is not known. Wild-type BC 7 stimulated higher IL- 8 responses than the BC 7 cbl and BC 7 adhA mutants in both CF and normal bronchial epithelial cells. To determine the role of cable pili and the associated adhesin, we characterized a mouse model of B. cenocepacia, where BC 7 are suspended in Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected intratracheally with wild-type BC 7 suspended in either alginate or PBS and were monitored for lung bacterial load and inflammation. Mice infected with BC 7 suspended in PBS completely cleared the bacteria by 3 days and resolved the inflammation. In contrast, mice infected with BC 7 suspended in alginate showed persistence of bacteria and moderate lung inflammation up to 5 days post-infection. Using this model, mice infected with the BC 7 cbl and BC 7 adhA mutants showed lower bacterial loads and mild inflammation compared to mice infected with wild-type BC 7. Complementation of the BC 7 cblS mutation in trans restored the capacity of this strain to persist in vivo. Immunolocalization of bacteria revealed wild-type BC 7 in both airway lumen and alveoli, while the BC 7 cbl and BC 7 adhA mutants were found mainly in airway lumen and peribronchiolar region. B. cenocepacia suspended in alginate can be used to determine the capacity of bacteria to persist and cause lung inflammation in normal <b>mice.</b> Both <b>cable</b> pili and adhesin contribute to BC 7 -stimulated IL- 8 response in vitro, and BC 7 persistence and resultant inflammation in vivo...|$|R
