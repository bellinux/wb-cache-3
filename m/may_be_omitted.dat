5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted,</b> for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted.</b> The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E

5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] is {{optional}} in XHTML5 and <b>may</b> simply <b>be</b> <b>omitted.</b> However, if the markup {{is to be}} processed as both XML and HTML, a DOCTYPE should be used.|$|R
25|$|The {{extra effort}} of using sequences, however, is {{justified}} since part {{or all of}} the structural rules <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted.</b> Doing so, one obtains the so-called substructural logics.|$|E
25|$|In other circuits, like {{filament}} heater circuits in {{vacuum tube}} electronics where the load {{is almost entirely}} resistive, smoothing circuitry <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> because resistors dissipate both AC and DC power,so no power is lost.|$|E
25|$|Any of {{the three}} noun {{elements}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> {{if it can be}} inferred from the context or from other syntactic clues; but many grammatical rules will still apply as if the omitted part were there.|$|E

2500|$|Pronouns are prefixed to the verb, in {{the order}} SUBJECT-INDOBJECT-OBJECT where INDOBJECT {{includes}} a preposition [...] "to", [...] "for", etc. They <b>may</b> all <b>be</b> <b>omitted,</b> e.g., hi³-ti³-gi¹xai³-bi²i³b-i³ha³i¹ [...] "he will send you to me".|$|R
25|$|However, if the noun {{is derived}} from a verb or adjective, it may take the same okurigana, {{although}} some <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> in certain cases (see below). The derivation may not be apparent if it is old and the verb {{is no longer in}} use (see below).|$|E
25|$|In {{some special}} cases, the outer gimbal (or its equivalent) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> {{so that the}} rotor has only two degrees of freedom. In other cases, the centre of gravity of the rotor may be offset from the axis of oscillation, and thus the centre of gravity of the rotor and the centre of {{suspension}} of the rotor may not coincide.|$|E
25|$|If {{the porch}} of a temple in antis has a row of usually four or six columns in front of its whole breadth, the temple is {{described}} as a prostylos or prostyle temple. The whole pronaos <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> in this case or just leave the antae without columns. An amphiprostylos or amphiprostyle repeats the same column setting at the back.|$|E
2500|$|A toneless or 4th-tone zero rime <b>is</b> <b>omitted</b> {{at the end}} of a polysyllabic word.

25|$|The {{process of}} editing the Papers of James Madison is complex. The {{first step is}} to verify {{authenticity}} of the documents. The PJM editors then decide how to represent each document. While some bureaucratic and routine correspondence <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> or mentioned in footnotes, the majority of Madison's papers are printed or abstracted in full, to illuminate his thinking and his public and personal life.|$|E
25|$|If it can {{be shown}} that {{spurious}} tripping would cause a greater problem than {{the risk of the}} electrical accident the RCD is supposed to prevent (examples might be a supply to a critical factory process, or to life support equipment), RCDs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted,</b> providing affected circuits are clearly labelled and the balance of risks considered, this may include the provision of alternative safety measures.|$|E
25|$|A term <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> from a {{well-known}} kenning: val-teigs Hildr “hawk-ground’s valkyrie/goddess” (Haraldr Harðráði: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is “goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk” = “goddess of gleam of arm” = “goddess of gold” = “lady” (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being {{a reference to}} falconry). The poet relies on listeners’ familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.|$|E

Non-textual material such as musical notation, mathematical formulae, and illustrations (except for any text they <b>may</b> contain) <b>are</b> <b>omitted</b> {{and their}} locations {{marked with a}} special tag. Extended text in non-Latin alphabets (Greek, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) <b>is</b> also <b>omitted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In COBOL, {{many of the}} {{intermediate}} keywords are syntactic sugar that <b>may</b> optionally <b>be</b> <b>omitted.</b> For example, the sentence [...] and the sentence [...] perform exactly the same function, but the second makes what action {{is going to be}} performed somewhat clearer.|$|R
50|$|Dargart's father's ancestry is {{recorded}} in one surviving genealogy, the Genelaig Albanensium, appended to {{a version of}} the Senchus fer n-Alban.

25|$|The washlet {{can replace}} toilet paper completely, but many users opt to use both wash and paper in combination—although use of paper <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> for {{cleaning}} of the vulva. Some wipe before washing, some wash before wiping, some wash only, and some wipe only—each according to his/her preference. Another frequent feature is a blow dryer, often adjustable between 40°C and 60°C, used to dry the washed areas.|$|E
25|$|Pirahã can be whistled, hummed, or {{encoded in}} music. In fact, Keren Everett {{believes}} that current {{research on the}} language misses much of its meaning by paying {{little attention to the}} language's prosody. Consonants and vowels <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted</b> altogether and the meaning conveyed solely through variations in pitch, stress, and rhythm. She says that mothers teach their children the language through constantly singing the same musical patterns.|$|E
25|$|Money {{laundering}} involves three steps: The first involves introducing {{cash into}} {{the financial system}} by some means ("placement"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash ("layering"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds ("integration"). Some of these steps <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>omitted,</b> depending upon the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that {{are already in the}} financial system would not need to be placed.|$|E
50|$|The average {{duration}} of courtship varies considerably throughout the world. Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples.
