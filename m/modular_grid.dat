The study focuses on two contexts included in the area of information design: Airport facilities and Olympic Games facilities. One of the intended outcomes was the possibility to propose and systematize one, or more, design methods and design procedures that aim to achieve a formal coherence in pictographic systems for use in cross-cultural facilities. Not only was it possible to obtain four different design methods and procedures, but also the opportunity to test and validate these results with a group of university students majoring in design. Of all of these, the one that ensures the attainment of formal coherence within and between figures is the <b>Modular</b> Standardized <b>Grid</b> Method. It was also considered that, when we follow a series of design procedures, which uses modular elements (formal syntactic attributes) articulated on a generating principle (grid or skeleton), the better we solve the problem of obtaining within and between formal coherence.

The proposed MaGate simulator is based on GridSim toolkit and Alea simulator, and abstracts the features and behaviors of complex fundamental grid elements, such as grid jobs, grid resources, and grid users. Simulation of scheduling tasks is supported by a grid network overlay simulator executing distributed ant-based swarm intelligence algorithms to provide services such as group communication and resource discovery. For evaluation, a comparison of behaviors of different collaborative policies among a community of MaGates is provided.

40|$|A unique {{topographical}} {{representation of}} space {{is found in}} the concerted activity of grid cells in the rodent medial entorhinal cortex. Many among the principal cells in this region exhibit a hexagonal firing pattern, in which each cell expresses its own set of place fields (spatial phases) at the vertices of a triangular grid, the spacing and orientation of which are typically shared with neighboring cells. Grid spacing, in particular, has been found to increase along the dorso-ventral axis of the entorhinal cortex but in discrete steps, that is, with a modular structure. In this study, we show that such a modular activity may result from the self-organization of interacting units, which individually would not show discrete but rather continuously varying grid spacing. Within our "adaptation" network model, the effect of a continuously varying time constant, which determines grid spacing in the isolated cell model, is modulated by recurrent collateral connections, which tend to produce a few subnetworks, akin to magnetic domains, each with its own grid spacing. In agreement with experimental evidence, the modular structure is tightly defined by grid spacing, but also involves grid orientation and distortion, due to interactions across modules. Thus, our study sheds light onto a possible mechanism, other than simply assuming separate networks a priori, underlying the formation of <b>modular</b> <b>grid</b> representations...|$|E
40|$|A directional-split, <b>modular,</b> {{user-friendly}} <b>grid</b> point distribution code {{is applied}} to several test problems. The code is self-adaptive {{in the sense that}} grid point spacing is determined by user-specified constants denoting maximum and minimum grid spacings and constants relating the relative influence of smoothness and orthogonality. Estimates of truncation error, in terms of flow-field gradients and/or geometric features, are used to determine the point distribution. Points are redistributed along grid lines in a specified direction in an elliptic manner over a user-specified subdomain, while orthogonality and smoothness are controlled in a parabolic (marching) manner in the remaining directions. Multidirectional adaption is achieved by sequential application of the method in each coordinate direction. The flow-field solution is redistributed onto the newly distributed grid points after each unidirectional adaption by a simple one-dimensional interpolation scheme. For time-accurate schemes such interpolation is not necessary and time-dependent metrics are carried in the fluid dynamic equations to account for grid movement...|$|R
30|$|Several {{approaches}} for modeling geometrically complex features {{have been documented}} in the literature. Azim and Abdelmoneim [1] presented mathematical model to describe the flow of reservoir fluid in hydraulically fractured reservoir using finite difference simulators {{in a manner that}} would allow the simulator to mimic the actual fracture geometry without dramatically increasing the number of grid cells and hence increasing the computing requirements and time. Their proposed design was applied to an anonymous field in the western dessert in Egypt and their simulated results were compared with the actual production data which was recorded after the fracture to verify that the model was capable of modeling the actual reservoir performance. Jacquemyn et al. [2] presented an approach that used a grid-free non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) curves and surfaces to represent realistic surface-based geological reservoir modeling that was based on a boundary representation in which all heterogeneity of interest (structural, stratigraphic, sedimentological, diagenetic) was modeled by its bounding surfaces, independent of any grid. However, the most general {{approaches for}} modeling geometrically complex features involve the use of fully unstructured grids (triangular grids in two dimensions and tetrahedral or prismatic grids in three dimensions) or structured grids coupled with locally unstructured grids. In addition, several technical issues must be resolved before highly complex geometrical features can be gridded and modeled in practice [3, 4, 5]. <b>Modular</b> <b>gridding</b> makes use of different grid types in different regions of the reservoir. For example, around a deviated or horizontal well, the grid might be radial (or nearly so); while in the vicinity of a complex multilateral well, the grid could be fully unstructured. Examples of fully unstructured grid systems include grids based on tetrahedral, pyramid, or prismatic elements. Previous techniques usually require highly robust unstructured gridding procedures. Jenny et al. [6, 7] provided an alternate approach to the modeling of geometrically complex features by hexahedral multi-block grids. These grids are locally structured (meaning they possess a logical i, j, k ordering locally) but are globally unstructured. Thus, they are adept at capturing many types of features, such as faults (the local grid is oriented with the fault) or deviated wells (the grid near the well is approximately radial).|$|R

The paper describes a study for an energy efficient, low cost construction modular system for multi-family housing, providing a high degree of flexibility and modularity. The first part of the research focuses on a state of art on housing projects realized in different countries. A critical review of these buildings leads to highlight the best technical and functional characteristics for each one with the aim to define a new proposal. The second part focuses on the identification of a <b>modular</b> <b>grid</b> allowing the creation of different flat layouts through the aggregation of modular units (rooms).

The main goal of the study is to overcome the rigidity typical of prefabricated solutions developed in the previous decades, providing a modular lightweight construction solution for housing.

While this description may accurately reflect certain aesthetic tendencies, it does not reflect the essence of its pedagogy. This paper will argue that the Basel approach to teaching design fosters formal discovery conducive to contextual awareness. The studio experience in Basel endorses form making as a structure for knowledge production. Ideas arise from the rigorous study of visual form. This approach does not impart aesthetic preference, neither does it entail adherence to a formal dogma, but rather offers a basic set of tools with which to engage the environment. The case study for this paper is based in the United Arab Emirates, a country undergoing massive infrastructural and socio-cultural transformation. A claimed capital of the world's construction activity, Dubai is home to thousands of cranes supporting ever more ambitious projects that have transformed fishing villages into dynamic urban environments. As a result, design pedagogy must address students who live in a place subject to constant change, and prepare them for a practice of improvisation. Students should primarily experience design as a process of critical observation, of assessing the past, present and potential qualities of a given situation. By analyzing the relevance of teaching methods refined in Basel to our studio-based program in visual communication design at the School of Architecture and Design, American University of Sharjah, we will discuss the significance of the Kunstgewerbeschule to contemporary design education.

40|$|Repetition, {{particularly}} as employed in minimalist art, has been contrasted to the poetic {{insofar as it}} is associated with notions such as sameness and standardization, while the poetic is associated with uniqueness and difference. In my work however, my aim is to express a poetics of nature {{through the use of}} repetition. Because of the centrality of repetition, minimal ism was the initial context that informed the research. But while minimalists emphasized the modular, which has connotations of standardization and mass production, my interest resides in how repetition operates in nature where there is never an exact replication. The key artists within the research context are Carl Andre whose use of the <b>modular</b> <b>grid</b> evokes a sense of environment; Claude Monet in relation to his investigations of the nuance of changing light and atmospheric conditions as manifested particularly in his water lily series; Paul Klee's use of repetitive tree-like structures; Agnes Martin's repetition of the horizon in her monochromatic paintings; Emily Kame Kngwarreye's repetition of marks/gestures that draw on nature in her paintings; and Vija Celmins' repetitions of marks and of oceanic and inter-stellar motifs. Correlations have been formed in the research between Gilles Deleuze's understanding of repetition within Difference and Repetition and Gaston Bache lard's definition of poetics within The Poetics of Space. I propose that the similarity of the operations of repetition and poetics suggests they can be viewed as being related, and that the essential condition of the two orders is mobility. The three main aspects of nature that have been researched in relation to mobility and repetition are: the wave and its dual characteristics within water and light; growth, particularly leaf vein structures that appear uniform but are unique; and time seen through cycles and evolutions in nature. My contribution to the field is in extending a dialogue in which repetition is not mere replication of the same but arises out of the recognition of difference within sameness...|$|E

To configure a sensing skin shaped by arbitrary cuts and rapid changes in designs, we use a wavefront planning approach to generate a minimumdepth spanning tree of an arbitrary topology of contiguous, regularly arranged modular sensing units on a flexible substrate wired network.
