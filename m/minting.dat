5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were struck in proof finish through {{the run of the}} Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some <b>minting</b> variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after <b>minting,</b> so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{authorized}} on June 16, 1936 the <b>minting</b> of 25,000 half dollar coins {{celebrating the}} 250th {{anniversary of the}} Dongan Charter.|$|E
5|$|The mint reopened as an assay {{office in}} 1876. Its {{machinery}} was evidently damaged during the war, {{but because of}} its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, {{to report on the}} condition of the facility for <b>minting.</b> Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new <b>minting</b> equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active <b>minting</b> service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed Morgan silver dollar from 1879 to 1904.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Australian <b>mint,</b> Australian coins were struck at {{branches}} of the Royal <b>Mint</b> - the Sydney <b>Mint,</b> Melbourne <b>Mint</b> and Perth <b>Mint.</b> The Royal Australian <b>Mint</b> is the first <b>mint</b> in Australia not to be a branch of the Royal <b>Mint</b> in London. The only other operational <b>mint</b> in Australia is the Perth <b>Mint.</b>|$|R

5|$|Aksumite {{currency}} {{were first}} minted {{in the later}} stages {{of the growth of}} the empire, when its Golden Age had already begun. The <b>minting</b> of coins began around 270, beginning with the reign of Endubis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the <b>minting</b> of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent <b>minting</b> activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty {{inherited}} the ban liang coin type from the Qin. In {{the beginning of}} the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private <b>minting</b> of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi (d. 180 BC), who abolished private <b>minting.</b> In 182 BC, Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6g (0.09oz) in weight.|$|E

50|$|Hard <b>mints</b> {{are hard}} candies or boiled sweets flavored with <b>mint.</b> Examples of hard <b>mints</b> include starlight <b>mints,</b> {{also known as}} {{pinwheel}} <b>mints,</b> white, circular, with red rays emitting from the middle; candy canes; humbugs; and brand name <b>mints</b> such as Altoids.|$|R
5|$|The <b>minting</b> {{of silver}} coinage began {{during the reign}} of AlexanderI as a means to pay for royal expenditures. ArchelausI {{increased}} the silver content of his coins as well as <b>minting</b> copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce. The <b>minting</b> of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of PhilipII and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Kingdom of Pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins. The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth. The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{continued}} {{the reform of}} coinage in the late 1330s. In 1336, he abolished the compulsory exchange of old coins for newly issued coins for villagers, but introduced a new tax, the chamber's profit, to compensate the loss of royal revenues. Two years later, Charles ordered the <b>minting</b> of a new silver penny and prohibited payments made in foreign coins or silver bars.|$|E
5|$|Confederate <b>minting</b> {{operations}} continued from April 1 {{until the}} bullion ran {{out later that}} month. The staff remained on duty until May 31, 1861. After that the mint was used for quartering Confederate troops, until it was recaptured {{along with the rest}} of the city the following year, largely by Union naval forces under the command of Admiral David Farragut.|$|E

5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of <b>minting</b> coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised <b>minting</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|The <b>minting</b> {{of silver}} coinage began {{during the reign}} of Alexander I as a means to pay for royal expenditures. Archelaus I {{increased}} the silver content of his coins in addition to <b>minting</b> copper coins in order to promote foreign and domestic commerce. Macedonians were the first who issued different coins for internal and external circulation, a sophisticated approach which shows an elaborate monetary system at an early date. In order to properly pay the soldiers of the Macedonian army with something other than general spoils of war, the <b>minting</b> of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Kingdom of Pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon were producing nearly identical standard coins. Yet the right to mint coins was shared by the central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the <b>minting</b> of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E
5000|$|The Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> was {{a former}} branch of the United States <b>Mint</b> built during the Georgia Gold Rush to help the miners get their gold assayed and <b>minted,</b> without having {{to travel to the}} Philadelphia <b>Mint.</b> It was located at (34°31.8′N 83°59.2′W [...] ) in Dahlonega, Lumpkin County, Georgia. Coins {{produced}} at the Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> bear the [...] "D" [...] <b>mint</b> mark. That <b>mint</b> mark is used today by the Denver <b>Mint,</b> which opened many years after the Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> closed.

5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} {{policies were}} {{closely associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased <b>minting</b> was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melted for immediate minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the <b>minting</b> of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.|$|E

Grant Centenary Association was founded with the goal of coordinating special observances and erecting monuments in recognition of Grant's historical role. The venture was financed by the <b>minting</b> of 10,000 gold dollars (depicted below) and 250,000 half dollars. The coins were minted and issued in 1922, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Grant's birth. Grant has also appeared on several U.S. postage stamps, the first one issued in 1890, five years after his death.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the <b>minting</b> of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|In 144 BC Emperor Jing {{abolished}} private <b>minting</b> {{in favor}} of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin. Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, but {{a year later he}} abandoned the ban liangs entirely {{in favor of}} the wuzhu (五銖) coin, weighing 3.2g (0.11oz). The wuzhu became China's standard coin until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began <b>minting</b> pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E

50|$|The $5 {{denomination}} has {{the distinction}} of being the only denomination for which coins were <b>minted</b> at eight US <b>mints.</b> Prior to 1838 all half eagles were <b>minted</b> in Philadelphia because there were no other operating <b>mints.</b> In 1838, the Charlotte <b>Mint</b> and the Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> produced half eagles of the Coronet type in their first years of operation, and would continue to <b>mint</b> half eagles until 1861, their last year of operation. The New Orleans <b>Mint</b> <b>minted</b> half eagles from 1840 to 1861.
