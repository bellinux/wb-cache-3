Waterhouse Records was based in Minnesota, {{and at the time}} of the album's release it was available by <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> from Minneapolis. It includes performances from musicians Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke – both Scientologists. Other noteworthy contributors include Patrick Moraz and Denny Seiwell. Musical artist Jimmie Spheeris persuaded Hubbard to record the album, and also served as its executive producer. The string portions were written by David Campbell.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2011, the band started work on an EP which was recorded in February at the Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, Florida, with producer Jason Suecof. Just before the recording process began, bassist Brent Riggs and guitarist Bobby Thompson departed from the band and were replaced by Nick Schendzielos of Cephalic Carnage and Tony Sannicandro, respectively. On April 13, 2011, a video appeared on the internet of drummer Jon Rice performing a new song in the studio.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to pressing titles on regular black vinyl, most releases have an exclusive and/or limited sister pressing on colored or multicolored vinyl. Beginning with TMR-003, a limited edition handmade batch of 100 tri-colored 7" [...] vinyl, in equal parts black, yellow, and white, were produced for exclusive distribution at Third Mans Nashville location. Beginning with TMR-009, an additional 50 tri-colored vinyl have been pressed for random distribution in Third Man <b>mail</b> <b>orders.</b> Certain single releases {{have been sold}} on tri-colored vinyl available at record stores in the artists hometown instead of at the Nashville store. An additional 50 are still randomly distributed in <b>mail</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York City, Omaha, St. Louis, San Francisco and Seattle, all of which closed when Oliver shifted to <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> sales in March 1917. A minor recession in 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E
5|$|Longren {{established}} his own firm, the Longren Aircraft Corporation of Topeka, and began offering his airplanes via <b>mail</b> <b>order.</b> He designed and sold ten different models, {{all of which}} were acknowledged for their high quality and durability. The company, however, had only moderate sales and fluctuating commercial success. In late 1915, he was seriously injured in a mishap at a flying demonstration in Abilene, Texas, and thereafter the barnstormer devoted most of his time to architecture and design. He also took some time off beginning in 1917 when America entered the First World War – for nearly two years, he served as chief inspector of aircraft at the nation's first military aviation research and development center, McCook Field in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E

5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by <b>mail</b> <b>order,</b> by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} reprinted eight times and {{sold more than}} 16,000 copies by 1941. Thousands more were given away. It was sold in Chicago book stores and by <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> from Dilling's house. It was {{distributed}} by the KKK, the Knights of the White Camellia, the German-American Bund, and the Aryan Bookstores. Subscribers to Gerald Winrod's new journal, The Revealer, received a copy; fundamentalist preacher W. B. Riley, president of the Northwest Bible Training School, claimed he had given away hundreds of copies; and it was advertised and sold by the Moody Bible Institute. It was endorsed by officials in the DAR and the American Legion. Copies were bought by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the New York Police Department, the Chicago Police Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Los Angeles arms manufacturer bought and distributed 150 copies, and a tear gas manufacturer bought 1,500 copies, which it distributed to the Standard Oil Company, the National Guard, and hundreds of police departments.|$|E

5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} saw him in the Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E
5|$|A 26-episode anime {{television}} series adaptation, directed by Yoshinobu Yamakawa and produced by J.C.Staff, aired in Japan between October 6, 2012 and April 6, 2013 on Tokyo MX. The series was also streamed by Crunchyroll with English subtitles. The screenplay {{was written by}} Michiru Shimada, and chief animator Haruko Iizuka based the character design used in the anime on Itaru Hinoue's and Na-Ga's original designs. The anime series was released on nine BD/DVD compilation volumes between December 26, 2012 and August 28, 2013 by Warner Home Video in limited and regular editions. A BD containing an original video animation (OVA) episode was available for <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to those who bought all nine limited edition BD/DVD volumes.

Hanabee Entertainment has licensed the series in Australia and New Zealand for a January 2014 release on BD and DVD. MVM Films has licensed the series in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by <b>mail</b> <b>order.</b> It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E
