5|$|Cerebral edema, if {{associated}} with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous <b>mannitol</b> and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as {{in some other}} forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and <b>mannitol</b> are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analyses}} of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 367 kilocalories per 100 grams of bolete (as dry weight). The macronutrient composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 17.9 grams of protein, 72.8 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.4 grams of fat. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 92% water. The predominant sugar is trehalose (4.7 grams/100 grams dry weight; all following values assume this mass), with lesser amounts of <b>mannitol</b> (1.3 grams). There are 6 grams of tocopherols, {{the majority of}} which is gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E), and 3.7 grams of ascorbic acid.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, <b>mannitol</b> and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if <b>mannitol</b> is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and <b>mannitol.</b> The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
5|$|With other eukaryotes: Fungal cells contain membrane-bound nuclei with {{chromosomes}} {{that contain}} DNA with noncoding regions called introns and coding regions called exons. Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, sterol-containing membranes, and ribosomes of the 80S type. They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including sugar alcohols (e.g., <b>mannitol),</b> disaccharides, (e.g., trehalose), and polysaccharides (e.g., glycogen, {{which is also}} found in animals).|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and <b>mannitol.</b> Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. <b>Mannitol</b> acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. <b>Mannitol,</b> an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{the primary}} {{ingredient}} of <b>mannitol</b> salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others.|$|E
25|$|Julije Domac elucidated the {{structure}} of hexene and <b>mannitol</b> obtained from Caspian manna. He determined {{the place of the}} double bond in hexene obtained from <b>mannitol</b> and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved {{the structure}} of <b>mannitol</b> which had been unknown until then.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> salt agar {{is also a}} {{selective}} and differential medium. The <b>mannitol</b> indicates organisms that ferment mannitol: <b>mannitol</b> fermentation produces lactic acid, lowering the pH and turning the plate yellow. The salt is to select for halophiles; organisms that cannot withstand a high salt content are unable to grow well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although <b>mannitol</b> has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when <b>mannitol</b> is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes <b>mannitol</b> very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of <b>mannitol</b> also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets.|$|E
25|$|With polyols such as {{glycerol}} and <b>mannitol</b> the acidity of {{the solution}} is increased. With <b>mannitol</b> for example the pK decreases to 5.15. This {{is due to the}} formation of a chelate, −, and this feature is used in analytical chemistry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{classified}} as a sugar alcohol; that is, it {{can be derived from}} a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. <b>Mannitol</b> and sorbitol are isomers, the only difference being the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{an alcohol}} {{derivative}} of simple sugar mannose, {{and its use}} has been investigated since 1962. With a σ=.9, molecular weight of 182 daltons, half life of 2–4 hours, ease of preparation, chemical stability and free radical scavenging properties, it's been regarded as the principal osmotic agent for clinical use. However, it could cause diuresis, renal failure, hyperkalemia and hemolysis. If <b>mannitol</b> is administered, the dosage used is <b>mannitol</b> 20% solution of 1-1.5 g/kg, followed by 0.25-1 g/kg doses as needed every 1 to 6 hours depending on the ICP.|$|E
25|$|Some O. oeni strains can use {{fructose}} {{to create}} <b>mannitol</b> (which {{can lead to}} wine fault known as <b>mannitol</b> taint), while many other strains can break down the amino acid arginine (which can {{be present in the}} wine that is resting on the lees after fermentation from the autolysis of dead yeast cells) into ammonia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is popularly used as {{a cutting}} agent in cocaine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and <b>mannitol.</b> Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase <b>mannitol</b> yields.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{commonly}} used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of <b>mannitol</b> preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} both the sugar mannose and its {{hydrogenated}} sugar alcohol, <b>mannitol,</b> are derived from manna.|$|E
25|$|Sugar alcohols, such as maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol, <b>mannitol</b> and {{hydrogenated}} starch hydrolysate, are sweeteners made {{by reducing}} sugars.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with anuria, congestive heart failure, and active cerebral haemorrhage (except during craniotomy).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> is used {{to reduce}} acutely raised {{intracranial}} pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> {{acts as an}} osmotic {{laxative}} in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children..|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} {{calories}} {{in a piece}} of 5 gum. The gum contains aspartame (with phenylalanine), acesulfame-potassium, soy lecithin, sorbitol, <b>mannitol</b> and other sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{upon the}} type of {{infection}} present, an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly {{and sent to the}} laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzyme-based tests. A Gram stain is first performed to guide the way, which should show typical gram-positive bacteria, cocci, in clusters. Second, the isolate is cultured on <b>mannitol</b> salt agar, which is a selective medium with 7–9% NaCl that allows S. aureus to grow, producing yellow-colored colonies as a result of <b>mannitol</b> fermentation and subsequent drop in the medium's pH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> {{can be used}} to form {{a complex}} with boric acid. This {{increases}} the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{three studies}} that {{initially}} found that high-dose <b>mannitol</b> {{was effective in}} cases of severe head injury were {{the subject of an}} investigation published in 2007. Although several authors are listed with Dr. Julio Cruz, it is unclear whether the authors had knowledge of how the patients were recruited. Further, the Federal University of São Paulo, which Dr. Cruz gave as his affiliation, has never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only 4 studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of <b>mannitol</b> could not be reached.|$|E
25|$|Foods {{containing}} sorbitol, {{present in}} some diet drinks and foods, and occurring naturally in some stone fruits, or xylitol, present in some berries, and other polyols (sugar alcohols), such as erythritol, <b>mannitol,</b> and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as artificial sweeteners in commercial foods.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Beutler {{designed}} the first artificial storage media for red blood cells, introduced {{the use of}} <b>mannitol</b> (still a mainstay in red cell preservation), and devised a variety of approaches to maintaining red cell ATP and 2,3-DPG levels and determined {{the viability of the}} cells in human volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is {{typically}} by avoiding {{the use of}} aspirin in children. When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was seen. Early diagnosis improves outcomes. Treatment is supportive. <b>Mannitol</b> {{may be used to}} help with the brain swelling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannitol</b> {{is a type}} {{of sugar}} alcohol which is also used as a medication. As a sugar, it is often used as a {{sweetener}} in diabetic food, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease high pressures in the eyes, seen in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>mannitol</b> {{is attributed to}} Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$1.12 to 5.80 a dose. In the United States, a course of treatment costs $25 to 50. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna after its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food.|$|E
