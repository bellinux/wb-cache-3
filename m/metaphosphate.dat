40|$|Fe-BEA as {{catalyst}} for {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NOX with NH 3 was experimentally studied with focus on chemical deactivation caused by phosphorous exposure. Cordierite supported Fe-BEA samples were exposed to 10 or 50 ppm H 3 PO 4 for 14, 24 and 48 h in a continuous gas flow reactor at 350 C. The catalytic activity of the samples was studied by NH 3 - and NO-oxidation, NH 3 inhibition and NH 3 -SCR experiments. The phosphorous exposed samples were further characterized by NH 3 - and NO-TPD, XPS and XRD. The results from the activity {{studies show that the}} degree of deactivation due to phosphorous exposure is strongly dependent on the exposure time, while the rate of deactivation is the same for exposure with 10 and 50 ppm H 3 PO 4. The XPS results show that primarily phosphorous pentoxides (P 2 O 5) are formed after short time of phosphorous exposure while longer time of exposure results in formation of <b>metaphosphates</b> (PO 3 -). The relative amount of <b>metaphosphates</b> after 48 h of H 3 PO 4 exposure was about 45 % compared to phosphorous pentoxides. The storage capacity of NO was shown to decrease with increasing relative amount of <b>metaphosphates.</b> The activity studies show that longer time of phosphorous exposure results in significantly decreased activity indicating that the active iron species are very sensitive to phosphorous forming <b>metaphosphates.</b> We suggest that <b>metaphosphates</b> replace the hydroxyl groups on the active iron species in Fe-BEA as the main mechanism for the decreased activity for NH 3 -SCR in connection with phosphorous exposure. Furthermore, the NH 3 inhibition experiments show that the increased amount of strongly bound ammonia due to phosphorous exposure does not contribute to buffer the active iron sites with ammonia during transient SCR conditions...|$|R

50|$|Rebek’s {{independent}} research {{began in the}} 1970s, with a method to detect reactive intermediates. This was invented through application of polymer-bound reagents.

50|$|While {{earlier studies}} of APH(3') {{supported}} a mechanism involving the nucleophilic attack of γ-phosphate by the 3'-hydroxyl, more recent {{studies suggest that}} APH(3’) catalyzes {{the transfer of the}} γ-phosphate from ATP to an aminoglycoside through a dissociative mechanism, where deprotonation of the substrate is not critical to phosphate transfer, but instead the stabilization of a <b>metaphosphate</b> transition state.Additionally, APH(3’) has a nucleotide positioning loop (NPL) that closes down on the enzyme active site after binding ATP, facilitating the phosphorylation of the 3’-hydroxyl group. Key to correctly positioning the phosphate group are Ser27 and Met26 residues. Initially, two magnesium ions stabilized by Asn195 and Asp208 facilitate the binding of ATP in the active site and orient the ß- and γ-phosphate groups. The NPL then undergoes a conformational change to form a hydrogen bond between Ser27 and the ß-phosphate group. Upon binding of substrate, APH(3') undergoes another conformational change to orient Ser27 such that its amide backbone disrupts the alignment of ß-phosphate and γ-phosphate, weakening the γ-phosphate bond. The amide backbone of Met26 forms a hydrogen bond with the <b>metaphosphate</b> to stabilize the transition state, as a magnesium ion (designated Mg1) then lengthens the γ-phosphate bond, breaking it and effectively phosphorylating the hydroxyl group.|$|E
