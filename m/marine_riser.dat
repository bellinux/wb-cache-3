40|$|Marine environments {{with harsh}} {{conditions}} such as those {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland and Labrador, NL, Canada, place serious operating and performance demands on offshore structures built for oil and gas production. <b>Marine</b> <b>risers</b> for floating offshore platforms in such harsh conditions are subjected to continuous and various forms of excitations and vibrations, induced by severe waves, strong currents, high winds, sea ice, and iceberg collisions. Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) enhance stress fatigue in <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> and mooring systems, and consequently, shorten their expected design lifetime and increase the project 2 ̆ 019 s overall capital cost.

40|$|Vortex induced {{vibrations}} (VIV) can be {{a severe}} problem to <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> with regard to fatigue damage and drag loading. In order to design <b>marine</b> <b>risers,</b> therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have good theoretical and numerical models for prediction of VIV. Full-scale data are needed for verification of the models. To this end, three drilling risers were instrumented with accelerometers and rotation-rate devices for measurement of VIV.

In order to choose data records for further investigation and comparison with theoretical models the raw data had to be conditioned and converted to a suitable form. The paper describes how the riser lateral displacements were derived from the measurements. A major task has been to rid the acceleration measurements of the influence of gravity due to the riser's rotations out of the vertical and include the measurements of angular motion in a consistent way.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examined}} {{the potential of}} utilizing the Design of Experiments or DOE methodology for exploring the design parameters and environmental conditions that influence the tension in <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> for Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) ships. A resolution IV, 27 - 3 fractional (1 / 8 th) factorial, was first used to screen the initial design parameters, and then two foldover design augmentation techniques were used to resolve the aliased two-factor interactions effects. The responses for the fractional factorial design were gathered from OrcaFlex, the world's leading package for the dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems. It was found that riser tension is most affected by: vessel offset, wave height, water depth, interaction of wave period and water depth, and interaction of wave height and vessel offset. The resulting predictive model based on these important effects was validated by out of sample testing at design points other than those used in model development. From 20 test cases, the average deviation was about 1. 7 %, and the highest deviation between the full finite element model and the model developed using DOE was only 3. 4 %. This paper has shown that by using DOE methodology, a predictive model and the conditions that influence the tension in <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> for FPSO ships can be examined objectively and accurately, with minimal experimental runs...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{design and}} {{evaluate}} methods {{to optimize the}} visualization of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) in <b>marine</b> <b>risers.</b> VIV is vibration experienced by <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> in offshore drilling platforms due to ocean current flows, {{and appears to be}} perpendicular to the direction of such flows. VIV causes oil companies large capital losses, supply chain disruption, and environmental and brand name damage. For these reasons, both researchers and manufacturers try to improve their models of VIV, while creating risers more resilient to it. The first step to understanding VIV is rapid visualization, ie. the ability to efficiently visualize large amounts of simulated and field data. In this thesis, I evaluate high and low level heuristics that optimize the run-time performance of applications by taking advantage of 64 -bit machines with large memory stores. Such heuristics include the introduction of object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes, dynamic binary loading, and source code management. I demonstrate that using these techniques allows speedups of many orders of magnitude, {{depending on the type of}} optimization and the structure of the input data. Finally, I reengineer an existing collection of disparate visualizations to take advantage of these heuristics, and achieve a run-time speedup of two orders of magnitude in most visualizations. by Alexander Marinos Charles Patrikalakis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an advanced measurement system for real-time characterization of Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) in large-scale <b>marine</b> <b>risers.</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>risers</b> {{play a critical role in}} offshore oil and gas operations by transporting mud, debris, and hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the surface platform. The mechanical structure of the riser is constantly subject to the effect of vortex shedding produced by seawater flow, which may result in severe oscillations known as VIV. At present, the prediction of this potentially destructive phenomenon is a challenging area of research that has gained special attention. While there have been significant research contributions on vortex induced vibrations on small riser models (8 - 10 m in length), the number of experiments on large-scale risers is limited, mainly due to technical complexity, logistics, and cost involved in large scale testing. Furthermore, the experiments that have been carried out are often proprietary and their publication in scientific literature has been limited. High mode results have been a challenge since it is generally accepted that at least five accelerometers are required to accurately map a cycle, and most of the riser models have been instrumented with no more than ten or twenty accelerometers due to the associated technical challenges. The advanced system described herein is modular and has been tested with sixty-four accelerometers, theoretically capable of mapping 25 modes of vibration. This is, therefore, a significant development towards understanding the vortex shedding phenomenon at high modes. A complete description and design considerations for this advanced measurement system is presented in this paper. This includes aspects such as system architecture, hardware and software design, mounting procedure, and communication protocol for an actual application...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to study the dynamic behavior of gas expansion in <b>marine</b> <b>risers.</b> In case of well control situations in deep and ultra deep waters, gas influx shows no warnings if not little, making it difficult to handle the gas. It can be observed that the gas is completely soluble in the base oil of the drilling mud leaving no signs of the incident as observed from the surface. The dissolved gas starts to flash from the liquid when it experiences a reduction in pressure below the bubble point pressure of the system during circulation. Owing to the depth of the risers, gas may be trapped within the <b>marine</b> <b>risers</b> after successful shut-in of blow our preventers at the sea bed. Circulating the contaminated mud poses a major threat of explosive riser unloading when the gas expands rapidly when the hydrostatic pressure is not sufficient to contain the gas. This forms the basis of study of riser equilibrium point, above which a slight movement of gas can lead to riser unloading. Explicit and implicit models have been created to understand the dynamics of gas expansion during the circulation. Specific case of oil based mud when the gas is completely dissolved in the base oil is considered. To capture the time varying dynamics of the multiphase flow, drift flux models have been created for both water based and oil based mud. Effect of choke pressure and pressure losses due to friction and acceleration have been successfully investigated. Based on the study, a minimum threshold back pressure is recommended to be able to circulate out the contaminated mud by bypassing the riser equilibrium point and avoiding riser unloading...|$|R
