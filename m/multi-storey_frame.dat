40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the influence}} of a precast concrete cladding system on structural robustness of a multi-storey steel-composite building is studied. The analysis follows the well-established framework developed at Imperial College London for the appraisal of robustness of multi-storey buildings. For this scope a simplified nonlinear model of a typical precast concrete façade-system is developed. Particular attention is given to the connection system between structural frame and panel, recognised as the driving component of the nonlinear behaviour of the façade-system. Only connections involved in the gravity load path are evaluated (bearing connections). Together with standard connection, a newly proposed system (Slotted Bearing Connection) is designed to achieve a more ductile behaviour of the panel-connection system. A parametric study involving the dimensions of panel-connection components is developed to search for an optimal configuration of the bearing connection. From the appraisal of structural robustness of the panelised frame it is found that the standard connection systems may reduce the robustness of a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> due to a poor ductile behaviour while the newly proposed connection is able to guarantee an enhanced response to the panelised <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> thanks to a higher ductility...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{residual}} deformations when evaluating {{the performance of}} <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> structures subjected to ground motion is investigated in this paper. The limitations of damage indices available in the literature, either based on ductility, energy dissipation {{or a combination of}} both, in capturing such a significant aspect of the seismic response of frame structures are discussed. The concept {{of residual}} deformations as a critical complementary indicator to cumulative damage, introduced in a companion paper (Part I) for single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems, is herein extended to multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) frame systems. The seismic performance of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> structures, either representative of new designed or existing structures, is investigated, focusing on the response in terms of residual deformations. Residual deformations are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} hysteretic rule adopted, to the system inelastic mechanism as well as to the seismic intensity. The influence of higher modes and P-Δ effects on the final residual deformations is addressed. A combination of maximum drift and residual drift in the format of a performance matrix is used to define the system's global performance levels and is then extended to a framework for an alternative performance-based seismic design and assessment approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of cyclic and in-cycle degradation on seismic drift demands in moment-resisting steel frames (MRF) designed to Eurocode 8. The structural characteristics, ground motion frequency content, and level of inelasticity are the primary parameters considered. A set of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems, subjected to varying levels of inelastic demands, is initially investigated followed by an extensive study on <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frames.</b> The latter comprises {{a large number of}} incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) on 12 frames modelled with or without consideration of degradation effects. A suite of 56 far-field ground motion records, appropriately scaled to simulate 4 levels of inelastic demand, is employed for the IDA. Characteristic results from a detailed parametric investigation show that maximum response in terms of global and inter-storey drifts is notably affected by degradation phenomena, in addition to the earthquake frequency content and the scaled inelastic demands. Consistently, both SDOF and frame systems with fundamental periods shorter than the mean period of ground motion can experience higher lateral strength demands and seismic drifts than those of non-degrading counterparts in the same period range. Also, degrading <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frames</b> can exhibit distinctly different plastic mechanisms with concentration of drifts at lower levels. Importantly, degrading systems might reach a "near-collapse" limit state at ductility demand levels comparable to or lower than the assumed design behaviour factor, a result with direct consequences on optimised design situations where over-strength would be minimal. Finally, the implications of the findings with respect to design-level limit states are discussed...|$|R

As {{shown in this}} figure, the off-diagonal system has {{the highest level of}} deformation not only in RC frame members but also in steel members, especially in third member of steel ODBS. The rotational capacity is increased in ODBS, the most ductile system. Performance levels of flexural and X-braced frames are limited to Life Safety (LS) level, but for ODBS, level of performance has been extended to higher ductility about related design criteria. Six and fifteen stories flexural frames have plastic hinges more than X-braced frame. On the other hand in ODBS, more members are contributed in absorption of defined existing energy by nonlinear ductile behavior of plastic rotation and deformation proportional to flexural frame.

Such PED devices are normally incorporated within the frame structure between adjacent floors through different bracing schemes like diagonal and chevron, so that they efficiently enhance the overall {{energy dissipation}} ability of the seismically deficient frame structure in the loading direction. These PED devices function based on the large and stable energy dissipation obtained using energy dissipation mechanisms like visco-elastic and elasto-plastic.

40|$|Implementation of {{intensive}} forestry (fertilization, cultivation of non-native tree species, and clone cultivation) {{on part of}} the forested land area in Sweden and an increased construction of wood-framed multi-storey buildings can contribute to reduce the net carbon dioxide emissions of the built environment. This thesis evaluates the acceptance of and interest in intensive forestry and <b>multi-storey</b> wood <b>frames</b> among different actors, {{and some of the}} underlying reasons for their approach. The results of quantitative and qualitative studies among members of the general public, private forest owners, architects, and contracts managers in Sweden are presented in six different papers. Both intensive forestry and <b>multi-storey</b> wood <b>frames</b> lack sufficient acceptance and compliance with relevant institutions such as priorities, norms, and regulations {{in the eyes of the}} studied actors. The acceptance {{of intensive}} forestry would be larger among members of the general public if they would perceive such practices to have less negative environmental effects and perceive a greater need to increase forest growth. Among the private forest owners, the interest to cultivate non-native tree species would be larger if there were more positive attitudes towards the economic consequences. Architects and contracts managers associate multistorey wood frames with several disadvantages and uncertainties, primarily with respect to fire safety, stability, durability, and sound proofing. The contracts managers’ perceptions have stronger implications for the prospects for wood frames, than the architects’ perceptions do.  Promotional activities aimed to change such perceptions may improve the prospects for more wood <b>framed</b> <b>multi-storey</b> buildings in Sweden. The path dependency of Swedish multi-storey construction however implies that such activities are not enough for <b>multi-storey</b> wood <b>frames</b> to diffuse to greater extent.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{designing}} moment resisting concrete frames failing {{in a global}} mode is presented in this paper. Starting from {{the analysis of the}} typical collapse mechanisms of frames subjected to horizontal forces, the method is based on the application of the kinematic theorem of plastic collapse. The beam section properties are assumed to be known quantities, because they are designed to resist vertical loads. As a consequence, the unknowns of the design problem are the column sections. They are determined by means of design conditions expressing that the kinematically admissible multiplier of the horizontal forces corresponding to the global mechanism has to be the smallest among all kinematically admissible multipliers. In addition, the proposed design method includes the influence of second-order effects. In particular, second-order effects can {{play an important role in}} the seismic design and can be accounted for by means of the mechanism equilibrium curves of the analysed collapse mechanism. The practical application of the proposed methodology is herein presented with reference to the design of a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> whose pattern of yielding is validated by means of push-over analysis...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The final {{published}} version is available from: [URL] paper {{deals with the}} dynamic analysis of primary-secondary combined systems. The problem of selecting the vibrational modes to be retained in analysis is first addressed, for the case of secondary substructures which may possess numerous lowfrequency modes with negligible mass, and a dynamic mode acceleration method (DyMAM) is adopted {{in view of the}} application for seismic analysis. The influence of various approaches to build the viscous damping matrix of the primary-secondary assembly is then investigated, and a novel technique based on modal damping superposition is proposed. The results of a parametric study for a representative staircase system multi-connected to a two-dimensional <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> reveal that the DyMAM correction is capable of increasing the response accuracy with a reduced number of modes compared to the classical MAM (modal acceleration method). Furthermore, a new technique is proposed for assembling the damping matrix, which is shown to be a convenient alternative for modelling the dissipative forces in composite systems. Indeed, while mass and stiffness matrices can unambiguously be defined, various assumptions can be made for the damping matrix, inducing considerable variation in the predicted seismic response...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} new {{advances}} {{in the application of}} “Theory of Plastic Mechanism Control” (TPMC) are presented. TPMC is aimed at the design of structures assuring a collapse mechanism of global type. The theory has been developed in the nineties with reference to moment-resisting frames (MRFs) and progressively extended to all the main structural typologies commonly adopted as seismic-resistant structural systems. In particular, the outcome of the theory is the sum of the plastic moments of the columns required, at each storey, to prevent undesired failure modes, i. e. partial mechanisms and soft-storey mechanisms. The theory is used to provide the design conditions to be satisfied, {{in the form of a}} set of inequalities where the unknowns are constituted by the column plastic moments. This set of inequalities was originally solved by means of an algorithm requiring an iterative procedure. The advances presented in this paper are constituted by the identification of a “closed form solution”. This result is very important, because the practical application of TPMC can now be carried out even with very simple hand calculations. The practical application of TPMC is herein presented with reference to the design of a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> whose pattern of yielding is validated by means of both push-over analysis and incremental dynamic analyses...|$|E
40|$|Frame system {{structures}} which {{composed of}} only reinforced concrete columns, beams and slabs, have been recently adopted for many framed buildings. Generally, flexural stiffness of slabs is {{ignored in the}} conventional analysis of bare frame structures. However, in reality, the floor slabs may have some influence on the lateral response of the structures. Consequently, if the flexural stiffness of slabs in a frame system structure is totally ignored, the lateral stiffness of the global frames may be underestimated. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} research is to investigate the effects of floor diaphragms in <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frames</b> by comparing the two models of frames with slabs and without slabs. The results show that the slabs can slightly increase the lateral stability of bare frames by about 10 % to 18 %.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} numerical investigations carried out on an innovative repairable fuse device for dissipative beam-to-column connections in moment-resisting composite steel frames. The fuse consists of steel plates bolted to the web and bottom flange of the beam with a specifically detailed gap in the concrete slab. The behavior of the fuse device is studied by means of two different numerical approaches. Numerical analyses performed on detailed three-dimensional finite element models of beam-to-column sub-assemblages show that potential damage concentrates only in the fuse section, without any significant damage in the other structural elements. Repair work, if needed, is therefore limited to {{the replacement of the}} fuses only. The effects of some geometrical characteristics of the flange plates on the behavior of the fuses are investigated. In order to extend the results of the numerical analyses to <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frames</b> subjected to seismic excitations, simple numerical models of the device are developed and calibrated through the experimental results of laboratory tests. Non-linear dynamic and static analyses are performed on <b>multi-storey</b> composite steel <b>frames</b> and the effectiveness of the fuse devices is evaluated.

40|$|The magnetorheological (MR) damper is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising semi-active control devices for reduction of structural vibration. Due to the damper’s nonlinear characteristic, its inverse dynamics model is difficult to obtain. In this paper, a simplified approach, namely the Simplified Inverse Dynamics (SID) model, has been developed for both the Bingham plasticity model and the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. SID models have then been used to calculate the optimal fluid yield stress or input current, in order to realize the desirable control forces obtained from various optimal control algorithms. For each model, a piston velocity feedback (PVF) algorithm and a damper force feedback (DFF) algorithm have been formulated. The proposed model has been shown to be applicable to both small-scale and large-scale MR dampers. Also, different configurations of MR dampers, such as, different dimension, coil resistance, type of MR fluid, have been employed to show the generic nature of SID model. The effectiveness of force tracking using SID model has been demonstrated through a series of numerical simulations. A <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame</b> structure with MR damper-brace systems, using a large-scale 20 -ton MR damper, has been adopted.

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{based on the}} plastic hinge concept for study of the structural behaviour of steel framed structures exposed to fire is described. Most previous research on fire analysis considered the structural performance due to rising temperature. When strain reversal occurs during the cooling phase, the stress-strain curve is different. The plastic deformation is incorporated into the stress-strain curve to model the strain reversal effect in which unloading under elastic behaviour is allowed. This unloading response is traced by the incremental-iterative Newton-Raphson method. The mechanical properties of the steel member in the present fire analysis follows both Eurocode 3 Part 1. 2 and BS 5950 Part 8, which implicitly allow for thermal creep deformation. This paper presents an efficient fire analysis procedure for predicting thermal and cooling effects on an isolated element and a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>frame.</b> Several numerical and experimental examples related to structural behaviour in cooling phase are studied and compared with results obtained by other researchers. The proposed method is effective in the fire safety design and analysis of a building in a real fire scenario. The scope of investigation is of great significance since {{a large number of}} rescuers would normally enter a fire site as soon as the fire is extinguished and during the cooling phase, so a structural collapse can be catastrophic.

Shear wall, core wall and bracing system are commonly applied to resist the lateral loads. However in some cases, due to the architectural requirements, the frames have to be designed as unbraced. As a result, the lateral load due to wind needs to be catered by utilizing the stiffness of connections, columns and beams.
