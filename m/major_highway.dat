5|$|The southernmost {{section of}} the road {{was known as the}} White Plains Post Road in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> {{connecting}} New York City to White Plains, the Westchester county seat. Route22 in its modern form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
5|$|Highway 141 is {{the first}} <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> {{connection}} between Highway400 and Highway11 north of Barrie and the Muskoka Lakes Region. The highway terminates at Exit207 on both of these highways, {{and is the only}} highway in Ontario to begin and end at the same exit number. On Highway400, the Highway 141 junction is located near the Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport. Rosseau is the largest community located directly on the route.|$|E

5|$|State Highway 9, {{abbreviated}} as SH-9, OK-9, {{or simply}} Highway 9, {{is a major}} east–west highway in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Spanning across {{the central part of}} the state, SH-9 begins at the Texas state line near Madge, Oklahoma, and ends at the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith, Arkansas. State Highway 9 is a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> around the Norman area. At , SH-9 is Oklahoma's second-longest state highway (second to State Highway 3).|$|E
5|$|When Harriman State Park {{opened in}} 1910, the Monroe–Haverstraw highway was renamed Southfields Road. Three years later, {{a portion of}} the route became part of Seven Lakes Drive, a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> built to {{traverse}} the park. In 1916, Rockland County numbered its highways for the first time. The Rockland County section of the former Monroe and Haverstraw Road was designated as CR416 at this time. From 1919 to 1920, the highway was reconstructed and rebuilt to state standards.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running {{down the middle of the}} island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, Irene {{produced}} moderate {{rainfall and}} winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96homes were destroyed, and 1,200people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing {{three people in}} Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a <b>major</b> <b>highway,</b> and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Storo {{is a mixed}} {{residential}} and commercial area. It has traditionally been easily accessible by car due to being located along Ring 3, a <b>major</b> <b>highway.</b> The shopping center Storo Storsenter is located just beside the station. Following {{the opening of the}} rapid transit station, a new housing complex was built {{on the west side of}} the station, on a former freight yard owned by the Norwegian State Railways. The first stage with 260 apartments was finished in 2006; when finished, it will feature 900 apartments. The area, named Stasjonsbyen ("the Station City") was developed by ROM Eiendom. Ridership at Storo increased from 2,060 per day to 3,630 per day from 2003 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police and the OPP {{were called}} in for back up policing. It {{was the first time}} a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> was unlawfully {{occupied}} in the city. CP24 aired the protest live as breaking news coverage throughout the evening. The protest continued throughout the night, demanding an immediate response to the latest casualties in Sri Lanka. The highway was cleared and reopened after a message from the Liberal Party of Canada stated that they would make a statement on the issue soon. Three individuals were arrested during the protest for assaulting a police officer while on duty.|$|E

5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|Two major interstate {{highways}} and a spur converge in Mobile. Interstate 10 runs northeast to southwest {{across the city}} while Interstate 65 starts in Mobile at Interstate 10 and runs north. Interstate 165 connects to Interstate 65 {{north of the city}} in Prichard and joins Interstate 10 in downtown Mobile. Mobile is well served by many <b>major</b> <b>highway</b> systems. United States Highways US 31, US 43, US 45, US 90, and US 98 radiate from Mobile traveling east, west, and north. Mobile has three routes east across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay into neighboring Baldwin County, Alabama. Interstate 10 leaves downtown through the George Wallace Tunnel under the river and then over the bay across the Jubilee Parkway to Spanish Fort and Daphne. US 98 leaves downtown through the Bankhead Tunnel under the river, onto Blakeley Island, and then over the bay across the Battleship Parkway into Spanish Fort, Alabama. US 90 travels over the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge to the north of downtown onto Blakeley Island where it becomes co-routed with US 98.|$|E
