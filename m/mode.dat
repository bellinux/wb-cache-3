5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational <b>mode</b> and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this <b>mode.</b> As well as the straightforward longitudinal <b>mode</b> some others which are used include flexural <b>mode,</b> torsional <b>mode,</b> radial <b>mode</b> and drumhead <b>mode.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{two types of}} single-player {{gameplay}} including a strategic map and battle <b>mode.</b> The overworld-like map <b>mode</b> is where the player takes command of several ships. The <b>mode</b> is used to get ships into the battle <b>mode</b> and is essentially a simple turn-based strategy game. Up to four ships can be maneuvered at a time. The object of the <b>mode</b> is to prevent the enemy ones from reaching the Great Fox. It also allows players to fire missiles from the Great Fox that they have picked up from exploring in this <b>mode,</b> or from meeting certain conditions in the battle <b>mode</b> (usually destroying all enemies). When a craft that {{is controlled by the}} player encounters an enemy group or missile in this <b>mode,</b> the gameplay switches to the battle <b>mode.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{cooperative}} <b>mode</b> {{was added}} to the game after its launch. It supports two players and features four missions. Players are tasked to defeat multiple waves of enemies and complete a series of objectives, similar to a horde <b>mode.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{extended}} acoustic-phonon <b>modes</b> in a cylindrical GaAs quantum wire embedded in bulk AlAs. There {{are two kinds}} of resonant acoustic-phonon <b>modes</b> related to the wire dimensions: one is entirely extended in the system and the other is almost confined in the wire. Displacement of extended phonon <b>modes</b> in the wire region is enhanced for the resonant <b>modes.</b> The dispersion relations of these resonant <b>modes</b> have subband structures similar to those of confined phonon <b>modes</b> in free-standing wires. Owing to the resonant <b>modes,</b> the extended phonon <b>modes,</b> in the wire region, have characters of confined phonon <b>modes</b> in a free-standing wire rather than the usual bulk phonon <b>modes...</b>|$|R

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{operates}} as an all-electric vehicle or BEV when operating in charge-depleting <b>mode,</b> but it switches to charge-sustaining <b>mode</b> after the battery has reached its minimum {{state of charge}} (SOC) threshold, exhausting the vehicle's all-electric range (AER).|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius <b>Mode</b> is unlocked, similar to the Julius <b>Mode</b> in Aria of Sorrow. Julius <b>Mode,</b> in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius <b>Mode.</b> In Julius <b>Mode,</b> the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up <b>mode</b> {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this <b>mode</b> was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost <b>Mode</b> can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory <b>mode,</b> in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival <b>mode,</b> Combat <b>mode,</b> and Hard <b>mode.</b> The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard <b>mode</b> was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal <b>mode</b> was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this <b>mode</b> by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard <b>mode.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} <b>mode</b> is the G <b>mode</b> (G from graphite). This <b>mode</b> corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM <b>mode,</b> to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{includes}} additional {{modes of}} play that display elements {{not seen in}} the game's primary scenario. The New Game+ option allows a player that has completed the game to replay the game with all equipment and souls the player had acquired in a previous file. Additionally, the player can opt to start the game in Hard <b>Mode,</b> offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level. Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush <b>mode</b> involves the player facing all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after the player completes the game once. Julius <b>Mode</b> is an additional <b>mode</b> of play unlocked with the same method. The player takes control of , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{presentation}} {{is devoted to}} the construction of a stochastic reduced- order model for complex beamlike dynamical structures having a high modal density in the low frequency range. In some cases, in the low-frequency, a dynamical structure can exhibit both the global elastic <b>modes</b> (which characterize this low-frequency range) and numerous local elastic <b>modes.</b> This situation appears for complex heterogeneous structures presenting stiff parts and flexible parts. The presence of these flexible parts induces numerous local reasonance in the low frequency range. Furthermore, in this case, the elastic <b>modes</b> cannot be separated into global elastic <b>modes</b> and local elastic <b>modes.</b> Indeed, due to the coupling between global elastic <b>modes</b> and local elastic <b>modes,</b> the deformation of some global elastic <b>modes</b> have local contributions and the deformation of some local elastic <b>modes</b> have global contributions. Then there are no efficient sorting method which could be used to select the elastic <b>modes</b> as global elastic <b>modes</b> or as local elastic <b>modes...</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{is seen in}} Figure 1 {{that for}} the C̃-sequence, the square and product <b>modes</b> are {{accurately}} determined, whereas the original signal <b>modes</b> are often undetected at this SNR level. Moreover, {{it is found that}} the square <b>modes</b> are estimated with better accuracy than the product <b>modes.</b> Note that it is easy to identify and utilize the square <b>modes</b> of the signal for estimating the <b>modes</b> of the underlying signal. First the square-roots of all the estimated <b>modes</b> of the C̃-sequence are to be computed, then the complex amplitudes are to be estimated for all these computed <b>modes</b> utilizing the original signal sequence (Cadzow and Wu 1987). Selecting the original signal <b>modes</b> for M larger amplitudes will then be relatively straightforward. Note that in this way, the signal <b>modes</b> will be determined utilizing the square <b>modes</b> of the C̃-sequence. Thus, it should be the strategy that the <b>modes</b> of the underlying signal are to be determined utilizing the accurate estimates of the square <b>modes</b> of the C̃-sequence, because the estimates of the signal <b>modes</b> of the C̃-sequence may be inaccurate when the signal samples are corrupted with noise.|$|R
50|$|The <b>modes</b> of {{oscillations}} {{are divided}} into subgroups, each with different characteristic behavior. First they {{are divided into}} toroidal and spherical <b>modes,</b> with the latter further divided into radial and non-radial <b>modes.</b> Spherical <b>modes</b> are oscillations in the radial direction while toroidal <b>modes</b> oscillate horizontally, perpendicular to the radial direction. The radial <b>modes</b> {{can be considered as}} a special case of non-radial ones, preserving the shape of the star in the oscillations, while the non-radial don’t. Generally, only the spherical <b>modes</b> are considered in studies of stars, as they are the easiest to observe, but the toroidal <b>modes</b> might also be studied.|$|R
5|$|As {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many gameplay similarities with its predecessor and runs on a upgraded {{version of its}} engine. The game features a single-player <b>mode</b> that requires players to complete a series of missions under certain difficulty settings. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative <b>mode</b> and traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution graphics <b>mode,</b> widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's single-player <b>mode</b> and most of the multiplayer features.|$|E
5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special <b>mode.</b> There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em <b>Mode,</b> Egg <b>Mode,</b> Evolution <b>Mode,</b> and Travel <b>Mode.</b> These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em <b>Mode.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{behavior}} of <b>modes</b> of the Kerr geometry when the <b>mode's</b> frequency is purely imaginary. We demonstrate that quasinormal <b>modes</b> must be polynomial in nature if their frequency is purely imaginary, and present a method for computing such <b>modes.</b> The nature of these <b>modes,</b> however, {{is not always easy}} to determine. Some of the polynomial <b>modes</b> we compute are quasinormal <b>modes.</b> However, some are simultaneously quasinormal <b>modes</b> and total transmission <b>modes,</b> while others fail to satisfy the requisite boundary conditions for either. This analysis is, in part, an extension of the results known for Schwarzschild black holes, but clarifies misconceptions for the behavior of <b>modes</b> when the black hole has angular momentum. We also show that the algebraically special <b>modes</b> of Kerr with m= 0 have an additional branch of solutions not seen before in the literature. All of these results are in precise agreement with new numerical solutions for sequences of gravitational quasinormal <b>modes</b> of Kerr. However, we show that some prior numerical and analytic results concerning the existence of quasinormal <b>modes</b> of Kerr with purely imaginary frequencies were incorrect.

In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission <b>mode</b> is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events.
