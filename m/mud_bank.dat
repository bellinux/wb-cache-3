However a strong tide swung her around onto a <b>mud</b> <b>bank</b> and held there. She was not able to get herself off and even the assistance of the U.S. Revenue Steamer Galveston was to no effect. Late the next day she was hauled off by the use of her port anchor and a tug.

Following the conclusion of maneuvers in September, Admiral Diederichs left the squadron and was replaced by Admiral Karl Barandon.|$|E
500|$|With [...] {{of coastal}} belt, 400,000 {{hectares}} of inland water resources and approximately 220,000 active fishermen, Kerala {{is one of}} the leading producers of fish in India. According to 2003–04 reports, about 1.1million people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries. The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 608,000 tons in 2003–04. This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state. In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala. During the southwest monsoon, a suspended <b>mud</b> <b>bank</b> develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry. This phenomenon is locally called chakara. The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18%. Around 1.050million fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999–2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the [...] coast. Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland. Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand. In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70mGy/yr.|$|E

40|$|International audienceParticulate {{suspended}} matter concentration (SPM) were estimated over a 8 year time period (2002 - 2010) {{in the coastal}} waters of French Guiana from a regional algorithm applied to the MODIS monthly reflectance measurements. Comparison between SPOT images and MODIS-SPM maps revealed the strong spatio-temporal coupling between in water SPM and the dynamics of local (i. e. Kourou and Cayenne) <b>mud</b> <b>banks.</b> Highest MODIS SPM values (> 13 g m− 3 approximately) can be significantly associated with the subtidal part of the banks {{as well as to}} the related turbid plume. The migration of these <b>mud</b> <b>banks</b> induces strong interannual changes in SPM reaching up to 6 % year− 1 within increasing and decreasing patchy areas distributed alternatively along the coastline of French Guiana. <b>Mud</b> <b>banks</b> migration rates derived from MODIS SPM data reach in average about 2 km year− 1 in agreement with previous studies. The MODIS time series have allowed for a detailed description of the seasonality and interannual variations in the in-water SPM loads. Seasonal changes in SPM are related to the onset of the trade wind season. Marked non-linear patterns including a sharp evolution in the SPM values around 2005 as well as additional high frequency modulations have been emphasized within the upward and downward SPM trend regions. Concurrent temporal variations in the frequency of northward swells (favoring <b>mud</b> <b>banks</b> migration and reworking) as well as interannual changes in the amount of sediment delivered by the Amazon River have been shown to play a major role in the SPM temporal patterns observed in the French Guiana coastal waters.

40|$|The <b>mud</b> <b>banks</b> present picturesque {{instances}} of large- scale natural damping of sea surface waves. When waves propagate {{on the surface}} of a layer of inviscid fluid overlying a visco-elastic bottom fluid of greater density, surface wave energy is dissipated by the coupling between the surface waves and the waves generated at the interface. Using a dimensionally correct expression (Mac Pherson and Kurup, 1981) obtained from Gade’s mathematical model (1958), the wave energy attenuation is calculated for different wave periods, water depths and fluid layer thickness. The predicted wave decays are comparable to those observed in the <b>mud</b> <b>banks</b> where the seabed is of soft viscous mud.

40|$|This short {{communication}} highlights potential destabilisation of {{the muddy}} coast of Guyana, South America, caused by large-scale mangrove destruction. The {{stability of the}} coast of Guyana, {{which is part of}} one of the world's most extensive mangrove coasts, depends on large <b>mud</b> <b>banks</b> migrating alongshore {{from the mouth of the}} Amazon River and on mangrove colonisation of these banks. Under the pressures of economic development, the coastal zone of Guyana is progressively being transformed into agricultural land and aquaculture estates, protected by coastal dikes. These hard coastal defence structures, constructed in recent years, are less effective in dissipating wave energy than <b>mud</b> <b>banks.</b> They also hinder the various processes involved in the consolidation and subsequent mangrove colonisation of these banks, notably by enclosing mature mangrove forests and preventing propagule transport from these forests to <b>mud</b> <b>banks.</b> If unchecked, the progressive breakdown in the mud-bank and associated mangrove system that has led to progradation of the coastal plain of Guyana over the last 5000 years will result in large-scale coastal erosion that can only be countered by further engineering structures at prohibitive costs. The only coastal defence strategy, sound and viable over the long term, with regards to both environmental conservation and cost, consists in restoring a dynamic mud-bank and mangrove system on this wave-exposed coast...|$|R
60|$|Lamu is a {{very curious}} place, but the things which stand out most clearly in my memory in {{connection}} with it are its exceeding dirtiness and its smells. These last are simply awful.

No wonder people get fever at Lamu. And yet the place was not without a certain quaintness and charm of its own, though possibly -- indeed probably -- it was one which would quickly pall.|$|E
60|$|Fix {{your eyes}} for a moment on Venetia proper, and you will see how this has all {{happened}} and is still happening. Each mountain torrent that leaps from the Tyrolese Alps bring down in its lap a rich mass of mud, which has gradually spread over a strip of sea some forty or fifty miles wide, {{from the base of the}} mountains to the modern coast-line of the province. Near the sea--or, in other words, at the temporary outlet--it forms banks and lagoons, of which those about Venice are the best known to tourists, though the least characteristic. For miles and miles between Venice and Trieste the shifting north shore of the Adriatic consists of nothing but such accumulating mud banks. Year after year they push farther seaward, and year after year fresh islets and shoals grow out into the waves beyond the temporary deltas. In time, therefore, the gathering mud banks of these Alpine torrents must join the greater <b>mud</b> <b>bank</b> that runs rapidly seaward at the delta of the Po. As soon as they do so the rivers must rush together, and what was once an independent stream, emptying itself into the Adriatic, must become a tributary of the Po, helping to swell the waters of that great united river. The Adige has now just reached this state: its delta is continuous with the delta of the Po, and their branches interosculate. The Mincio and the Adda reached it ages since: the Piave and the Livenia will not reach it for ages. In Roman days Hatria was still on the sea: it is now some fifteen miles inland.|$|E
60|$|Maggiore, indeed, least {{fortunate}} of {{the three}} main sheets, is being attacked by the insidious foe at three points simultaneously. At the upper end, the Ticino, that furious radical river, has filled in a large arm, which once spread far away up the valley towards Bellinzona. A little lower down, the Maggia near Locarno carries in a fresh contribution of mud, which forms another fan-shaped delta, and stretches its ugly mass half across the lake, compelling the steamers to make a considerable detour eastward. This delta is rapidly extending into the open water, and will in time fill in the whole remaining space from bank to bank, cutting off {{the upper end of}} the lake about Locarno from the main basin by a partition of lowland. This upper end will then form a separate minor lake, and the Ticino will flow out of it across the intervening mud flat into the new and smaller Maggiore of our great-great-grandchildren. If you doubt it, look what the torrent of the Toce, the third assailing battalion of the persistent mud force, has already done in the neighbourhood of Pallanza. It has entirely cut off {{the upper end of the}} bay, that turns westward towards the Simplon, by a partition of mud; and this isolated upper bit forms now in our own day a separate lake, the Lago di Mergozzo, divided from the main sheet by an uninteresting <b>mud</b> <b>bank.</b> In process of time, no doubt, the whole of Maggiore will be similarly filled in by the advancing mud sheet, and will become a level alluvial plain, surrounded by mountains, and greatly admired by the astute Piedmontese cultivator.|$|E
