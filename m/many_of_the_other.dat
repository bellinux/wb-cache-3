5|$|During {{his time}} at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{inevitable}} engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during {{the development of the}} Apollo spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{applications}} of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers. For example, {{it can be used}} to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined.|$|E
50|$|CPSU {{candidates}} {{accounted for}} around three quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominees, whilst <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were members <b>of</b> Komsomol.|$|R
2500|$|The 1994 {{documentary}} on a 1958 Esquire Magazine A Great Day in Harlem photo shoot for jazz musicians in New York contains <b>many</b> remembrances <b>of</b> Young by musicians who participated. [...] Young was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants and for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>the</b> photo shoot {{was the last}} time they saw him alive.|$|R
25|$|They seemed rather brow-beaten by <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> kept {{themselves}} to themselves. They {{were the most}} interesting element, however. Unlike <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> they had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult.|$|R
5|$|The {{names of}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> areas of Sheffield {{likely to have}} been {{established}} as settlements during this period end in ley, which signifies a clearing in the forest, or ton, which means an enclosed farmstead. These settlements include Heeley, Longley, Norton, Owlerton, Southey, Tinsley, Totley, Wadsley, and Walkley.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> activities have been curtailed since 2004 {{due to the}} security fence that was constructed around {{the banks of the}} reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary.|$|E
5|$|Zell {{lived at}} the same orphanage as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> protagonists; this is where Seifer first began to bully him. He was later adopted by the Dincht family {{in the town of}} Balamb. His {{motivation}} for enrolling at Garden is {{to live up to the}} memory of his grandfather, a famous soldier.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 he {{intervened in}} a dispute between the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company, {{in which he had}} shares, and the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway Company. Though <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> had sold their shares in disgust, he secured an {{agreement}} between the two companies.|$|R
40|$|A survey among 500 {{adolescent}} {{pupils in}} rural Uganda suggests widespread interest in online information about sexual health and HIV/AIDS.

50|$|Fatality reaches Zamaron {{just in time}} {{to defend}} the planet against an attack by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinestro Corps who had come to {{retrieve}} their captured female members.

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
25|$|The CQC also {{inspected}} 132 similar {{institutions and}} a Serious Case Review was commissioned – some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roughly ten {{local and national}} enquiries were carried out to examine what went wrong, including one by NHS Southwest which was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first to be published and list <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
25|$|At Alexandria, {{relations}} between Banks and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> deteriorated further. Each side sent exaggerated accounts to friendly newspapers and supporters. General John McClernand arrived with reinforcements from Texas, {{and he had}} also previously had poor relations with A. J. Smith and Porter. Smith obeyed only those orders he wanted to obey.|$|R
2500|$|Disaster {{struck the}} town in 1824, when first its only local bank (known as Holgate's) collapsed, forcing <b>the</b> closure <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest mills. [...] This was {{followed}} by a summer drought, which caused serious problems for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> leading to high levels of unemployment and possibly contributing to the national financial crisis of 1825.|$|R
5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback {{took so long}} to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', like <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> weapons produced {{for use by the}} Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 14 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet. It follows the traditional rhyme scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form: abab cdcd efef gg. Like <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in <b>the</b> sequence, it is written in a type of metre called iambic pentameter, {{which is based on}} five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line.|$|R
40|$|When {{we live in}} a {{successful}} democratic society, we are surrounded by political, legal, economic, and social institutions, each of which seems to depend on <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> When these institutions do not exist or are not functioning, which institutions must be established first to begin moving from anarchy toward prosperity?

25|$|The 29 {{passengers}} {{that originally}} survived the crash {{were taken to}} Atlanta-area hospitals, including Grady, Atlanta Medical Center, and Piedmont Hospital. Baseball coach James Grandey, 29, and four players were reported in serious or critical condition, one of whom later died. As of March 15, 2007, James Grandey was reported in good condition and released. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were treated and released.|$|R
5|$|Guy de Beauchamp {{is today}} remembered {{primarily}} {{for his part}} in the killing of Gaveston, but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning. He owned what was for his time a large collection of books, and his advice was often sought by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> earls. Next to Lancaster, he was the wealthiest peer in the nation, and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son, Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|Herchmer {{recruited}} and {{commanded a}} group of 144 mounted police volunteers, who made up {{almost half of the}} new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> volunteers in the battalion were also ex-policemen. Soon after the battalion's arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer's superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer complained to the Prime Minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter of the Liberal government.|$|E
5|$|Holkham Hall {{is one of}} England's finest {{examples}} of the Palladian revival style of architecture, and the severity of its design is closer to Palladio's ideals than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> numerous Palladian style houses of the period. The Holkham Estate, had been built up by Sir Edward Coke, the founder of his family fortune. He bought Neales manor in 1609, though never lived there, and many other purchases of land in Norfolk to endow to his six sons. His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home and by 1659 John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors. It is the ancestral home of the Coke family, the Earls of Leicester of Holkham.|$|E
50|$|DMSO {{is finding}} {{increased}} use in manufacturing processes to produce microelectronic devices. It {{is widely used}} to strip photoresist in TFT-LCD 'flat panel' displays and advanced packaging applications (such as wafer-level packaging / solder bump patterning). It also used in biopreservation especially stem cell banking. DMSO is an effective paint stripper, being safer than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> such as nitromethane and dichloromethane.|$|R
50|$|Cullen station had {{a single}} curved {{platform}} with the typical wooden style of station building, however it was larger than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> with a central canopy between two wings. a passing loop was not provided. The 1902 OS map shows a weighing machine in the goods yard, several sidings and a goods shed. A station agent's or stationmaster's cottage sat near to the station.|$|R
25|$|The next morning, some {{of those}} who had fled {{returned}} to <b>the</b> smoking ruins <b>of</b> their village. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies in the houses could be identified; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> who had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes in their heads, chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charred corpses had already been partially devoured by dogs and other animals.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana was {{directed}} by Mana series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> developers were new to the series, including producer Akitoshi Kawazu, the director and producer of many games in Square's SaGa series, and designer Akihiko Matsui, {{who had been the}} director for Chrono Trigger. The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also new to the series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.|$|E
5|$|Like in <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{islands of}} the Pacific, Rugby Union is a popular sport. The Cook Islands {{national}} rugby union team began playing {{on the international stage}} in 1971. Sevens rugby is also played and has its own association, as does netball, sevens rugby, weightlifting and powerlifting, table tennis, Tae Kwon-Do, and volleyball. The Cook Islands Round Cup is the top division of the Cook Islands Football Association and plays at the National Stadium among other venues.|$|E

25|$|Calcium channel blockers, {{also known}} as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used {{for a number of}} health conditions. Thus they are {{commonly}} present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused <b>the</b> greatest number <b>of</b> deaths in 2010 in the United States was verapamil. This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{student at}} Rank's [...] "Charm School", Lee and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> had {{difficulty}} finding work. He finally made his film début in Terence Young's Gothic romance Corridor of Mirrors (1947). He played Charles; the director got around his height by placing {{him at a}} table in a nightclub alongside Lois Maxwell, Mavis Villiers, Hugh Latimer and John Penrose. Lee had a single line, [...] "a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead's bravura".|$|R
