5|$|The Burns–Hines {{region has}} a high-desert climate but was much wetter {{in the recent}} {{geologic}} past. The Harney Basin was the largest of many depressions in which lakes formed in southeastern Oregon during the late Pleistocene. Remnants of an ancient lake that reached {{as far north as}} Burns {{are at the center of}} the <b>Malheur</b> National Wildlife Refuge, south of the city.|$|E
5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and <b>Malheur</b> County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E
5|$|Each April, Burns {{hosts the}} John Scharff Migratory Bird Festival and Art Show during the annual spring {{migration}} of waterfowl and other birds through the area. Pelicans, ducks, and raptors {{are among the}} birds frequenting the Harney Basin wetlands, a stopping place on the Pacific Flyway. Named for a former manager of the <b>Malheur</b> National Wildlife Refuge, the festival includes tours of the wetlands and nearby ranches as well as classes in topics such as birdhouse building, Harney County archeology, and bird sketching.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Tactics Advance {{revolves}} around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, {{the main character}} who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz <b>Malheur,</b> a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world {{into the world of}} Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa <b>Malheur</b> me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|The {{direction}} of Oregon stream flow {{is influenced by}} four major drainage divides: the Oregon Coast Range on the west, the Cascade Range further inland, the Klamath–Siskiyou Mountains in the southwest, and the Blue Mountains in the northeast. One set of streams, including the Nehalem River, flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the Deschutes River, flow into the Columbia River or its tributaries. A third set, including the Klamath River and its tributaries, originates in Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the Donner und Blitzen River flow into closed basins, such as <b>Malheur</b> Lake, that have no outlet to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 18thcentury {{and into}} the early 19thcentury, the Northern Paiute had {{numerous}} conflicts with tribes who lived to the northwest. The Wasco-Wishram and other Chinook tribes often encroached on the high desert landscape of the Northern Paiute territory. After one such incident in 1811, the Northern Paiute migrated north to the Columbia River and attacked Wasco canoes. Around this time, the Northern Paiute numbered approximately 7,500. The Snake War, a war between the natives and white settlers in {{the region in the}} 1860s, killed roughly two thirds {{of the population of the}} Northern Paiute. The whites won the war and then set aside the <b>Malheur</b> Reservation for the Northern Paiute and other Oregon Native American tribes.|$|E
5|$|Pets {{are allowed}} in {{developed}} areas and along hiking trails {{but must be}} leashed or otherwise restrained. Horses are not allowed on hiking trails, in picnic areas, or on bare rock exposures in undeveloped areas of the monument. Digging, disturbing, or collecting any of the park's natural resources, including fossils, is prohibited. Fossil theft is an ongoing problem. No mountain biking is allowed on monument land, although the <b>Malheur</b> National Forest east of Dayville has biking trails. Fishing is legal from monument lands along the John Day River for anyone with an Oregon fishing license. Rafting on the John Day River is seasonally popular, although the favored runs begin at or downstream of Service Creek and do not pass through the monument. Risks to monument visitors include extremely hot summer temperatures and icy winter roads, two species of venomous rattlesnakes, two species of poisonous spiders, ticks, scorpions, puncturevine, and poison ivy.|$|E

25|$|French Canadian and métis trappers and missionaries {{arrived in}} the eastern part of the state in the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, many having {{travelled}} as members of Lewis and Clark and the 1811 Astor expeditions. Some stayed permanently, including Étienne Lussier, believed to be the first European farmer in the state of Oregon. The evidence of this French Canadian presence can be found in the numerous names of French origin in that part of the state, including <b>Malheur</b> Lake and the <b>Malheur</b> River, the Grande Ronde and Deschutes rivers, and the city of La Grande.|$|E

25|$|Volcanic lakes are lakes that occupy either local depressions, e.g. craters and maars {{or larger}} basins, e.g. calderas, created by volcanism. Crater lakes are formed in {{volcanic}} craters and calderas, which {{fill up with}} precipitation more rapidly than they empty via either evaporation, groundwater discharge, or combination of both. Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes, although often no distinction is made. An example is Crater Lake in Oregon, in the caldera of Mount Mazama. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption {{that led to the}} subsidence of Mount Mazama around 4860 BC. Other volcanic lakes are created when either rivers or streams are dammed by lava flows or volcanic lahars. The basin within which <b>Malheur</b> Lake, Oregon was created when a lava flow dammed the <b>Malheur</b> River.|$|E
25|$|Quảng Ngãi {{province}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} provinces in central Vietnam (together with Quảng Trị) to organize self-defense units in March 1945. The Ba Tơ Guerrilla Unit mobilized tens of thousands of peasants. It was known as a Vietcong stronghold during the Vietnam War and was the site of the purported Bình Hòa massacre (1966) and the My Lai Massacre (1968), as well as Operations <b>Malheur</b> I and <b>Malheur</b> II and Operation Quyet Thang 202. Quảng Ngãi was known to be a Viet Cong stronghold during the war, and the site of numerous ambushes and attacks against ARVN and American troops, particularly at night. The province produced famous war literature on both sides of the conflict: The now-famous wartime diary of Viet Cong medic Đặng Thùy Trâm was written here, and from an American perspective, Quảng Ngãi Province is the major setting of Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no records of the {{earliest}} people to inhabit the Harney Basin, Native Americans used the wetland areas around <b>Malheur</b> Lake, Harney Lake, and Donner und Blitzen River {{for thousands of years}} before the arrival of European settlers. By the time Europeans began to explore the area in the early nineteenth century, the Northern Paiute people were well established in the Harney Basin.|$|E
