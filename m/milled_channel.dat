40|$|The use {{of copper}} tubular thrust {{chambers}} {{is particularly important}} in high performance expander cycle space engines. Tubular chambers have more surface area than flat wall chambers, and this extra surface area provides enhanced heat transfer for additional energy to power the cycle. This paper was divided into two sections: (1) a thermal analysis and sensitivity study; and (2) a preliminary design of a selected thrust chamber configuration. The thermal analysis consisted of a statistical optimization to determine the optimum tube geometry, tube booking, thrust chamber geometry, and cooling routing to achieve the maximum upper limit chamber pressure for a 25, 000 pound thrust engine. The preliminary design effort produced a layout drawing of a tubular thrust chamber that is three inches shorter than the Advanced Expander Test Bed (AETB) <b>milled</b> <b>channel</b> chamber but is predicted to provide a five percent increase in heat transfer.

40|$|The life {{analysis}} used {{to compare}} copper tubes and <b>milled</b> copper <b>channels</b> for rocket engine cooling passages is described.

The analysis was a two-dimensional elastic-plastic comparison, using a finite element method, to illustrate that, under the same thermal and pressure loading, the compliant shape of the tube increases the life of the chamber. The analysis indicates that for a hot-gas-side-wall temperature of 100 F the critical strain decreases from 1. 25 percent in the channel to 0. 94 percent in the tube. Since the life of rocket thrust chambers is most often limited by cyclic strain or strain range, this decrease corresponds to an expected tube life which is nearly twice the channel life...|$|R

5000|$|The river {{through the}} woods was {{engineered}} to provide water which powered wool, corn and saw mills for two centuries. A dam across the river creates the stretch known as the Long Dam, and a sluice above the dam feeds water into the Round Dam, from where water enters a culvert and a high-level channel called Sandy Goit that once fed the mill {{near the entrance to}} the woods. Sougha Gill adds to the flow just below the dam, and further down, the water from the <b>mill</b> <b>channel</b> flows under the footpath through a stone lined channel to rejoin the river. The mill began life as a cotton mill in 1785, and was built by Peter Garforth, John Blackburn and John Sidgwick. Wooden frames for spinning the cotton yarn were powered by water, but the water supply was not adequate to support two shifts, and production was scaled down. In 1825, the mill was extended, and the new section used steam power. By 1882, some weaving was carried out at the mill, but it was marked as disused on the 1891 Skipton Town plans.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of high pressure liquid propellant rocket engine thrust chambers is typically maintained through regenerative cooling. The coolant flows through passages formed either by constructing the chamber liner from tubes or by <b>milling</b> <b>channels</b> in a solid liner. Recently, Carlile and Quentmeyer showed life extending advantages (by lowering hot gas wall temperatures) of <b>milling</b> <b>channels</b> with larger height to width aspect ratios (AR {{is greater than}} 4) than the traditional, approximately square cross section, passages. Further, the total coolant pressure drop in the thrust chamber could also be reduced, resulting in lower turbomachinery power requirements. High aspect ratio cooling channels could offer many benefits to designers developing new high performance engines, such as the European Vulcain engine (which uses an aspect ratio up to 9). With platelet manufacturing technology, channel aspect ratios up to 15 could be formed offering potentially greater benefits. Some issues still exist with the high aspect ratio coolant channels. In a coolant passage of circular or square cross section, strong secondary vortices develop as the fluid passes through the curved throat region. These vortices mix the fluid and bring lower temperature coolant to the hot wall. Typically, the circulation enhances the heat transfer at the hot gas wall by about 40 percent over a straight channel. The effect that increasing channel aspect ratio has on the curvature heat transfer enhancement has not been sufficiently studied. If the increase in aspect ratio degrades the secondary flow, the fluid mixing will be reduced. Analysis has shown that reduced coolant mixing will result in significantly higher wall temperatures, due to thermal stratification in the coolant, thus decreasing {{the benefits of the}} high aspect ratio geometry. A better understanding of the fundamental flow phenomena in high aspect ratio channels with curvature is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of this geometry. The fluid dynamic and conjugate heat transfer problem of high aspect ratio rocket engine coolant channels are being investigated numerically, but these efforts have been hampered by a lack of validating data. Wall temperature data is available for the conjugate problem for channels without curvature and aspect ratio = 5. 0, and unheated fluid dynamic data are available for square and circular cross section channels with curvature at Reynold's numbers up to 40, 000. But the effects of aspect ratio on secondary flow development have not been experimentally studied. To provide some insight into the effects of channel aspect ratio on secondary flow and to qualitatively provide anchoring for the numerical codes, a flow visualization experiment was initiated at the NASA Lewis Research Center...|$|R

40|$|Glass is {{a fantastic}} {{material}} for a medical device. It is biocompatible, chemically inert, straightforward sterilisable and optically transparent, but machining is also a challenge. Spark Assisted Chemical Engraving (SACE) is a hybrid technology based on thermally assisted chemical etching of glass. Discovered by Kurafuji and Suda in 1968 [1], this process now emerges at the industrial level as a flexible, rapid and cost-effective possibility to machine the glass. This novel technology machines the glass without burrs, cracks or deposits on the surface. A pulsed potential [2] is applied between the tool and a counter-electrode into a conductive electrolyte, typically NaOH. Sparks appear at the tool, which allows increasing the temperature of electrolyte locally around the tool. The electrolyte, when heated, becomes highly corrosive for glass, which is ?electro-dissolved? locally. This process coupled to a highly accurate Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine allows drilling micro-holes with a depth of millimetres {{in a few seconds}} and <b>mills</b> <b>channels</b> of several hundred microns deep without difficulty. With this equipment, it is also possible to cut the glass over a thickness of a few millimetres or create a chamfer, for example.
