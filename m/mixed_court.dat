Bloomfield assisted King Carol II of Romania in his attempt to gain entry into Canada after World War II, and was an executor of the Lady Davis estate. He was appointed a King's Counsel in 1948 and was elected to serve on the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Court</b> of Tangier (Tribunal Mixte Tangier) within the international zone of Tangier in 1949. In 1952, Bloomfield co-founded the Canadian branch of the International Law Association with Maxwell Cohen, Gerald F. FitzGerald, and Nicolas Mateesco-Matte. He served as that organization's president from 1964 to 1978, and was an honorary president from 1974 until his death in 1984. From 1968 to 1972, he was a council member of the American Society of International Law.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Paul Gautier, Alexios {{appears to have}} entrusted his brother {{with the role of}} [...] "grand inquisitor and guardian of public order". As such, Isaac headed a special tribunal, and was charged by Alexios with a number of delicate assignments. Thus, when Alexios left for the Dyrrhachium campaign against the Normans in autumn 1081, Isaac was left in charge of keeping order in Constantinople. During the campaign, Alexios was constantly in need of money to pay his troops. A first appeal for financial aid was met by the Komnenoi themselves, as well as their relatives and supporters, but when a second appeal came soon after, Isaac and his mother, who had been left in charge of the government, were at an impasse. After long deliberation, they decided to turn to the treasures of the Church—following a precedent set by previous emperors {{all the way back to}} Heraclius (...) [...] Thus, in the winter of 1081/1082, and without prior warning, Isaac went to the Hagia Sophia, convened the patriarchal synod, and in a forceful speech convinced the clergy to allow the confiscation and melting of gold and silver items to cut coin to pay the troops. Only a single member of the synod, the deacon John Metaxas, opposed the move, and even went as far as ridiculing Isaac, but once the confiscation began, Leo, the Metropolitan of Chalcedon, who had not been present at the synod, started to publicly denounce the decision as well as Isaac, its chief instigator. This led to Leo's trial and dismissal by a <b>mixed</b> <b>court</b> composed of senators and senior clergymen in January 1086.|$|E
50|$|The years 1926 to 1937 were {{years of}} great change. As the period {{drew to a}} close the final chapter {{in the history of the}} <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> began. In the 1920s they had seemed set to endure forever, but by the 1930s rapid and radical {{political}} change had sounded a warning note. In many ways the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> had themselves encouraged the critical analysis, close reasoning, and scholarly research that had led to an educated elite of lawyers in Egypt. Those trained in law were at the front of nationalism, and in a way the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> encouraged the very freedom of thought, independence of action, and respect for a national and sovereign rule of law which fostered much of the moderate nationalist opinion. By 1937 the merger of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> was agreed, by 1949 it was taking place.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{judgments}} of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> were respected and trusted was that they were not seen by Egyptians as foreign law.

50|$|In essence, {{this was}} true {{culmination}} of the 1875 reforms. From {{the beginnings of the}} <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> in 1875, to the Native Courts in 1883, and the Montreux Convention reforms in 1937, the various jurisdictions of the Egyptian legal system drew closer together, {{while at the same time}} foreign consular jurisdiction lessened. Finally, the whole of Egypt’s legal system became unified in 1956. The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> paved the way for this to happen by the gradual cycle of reform, development and reform. The fusion of the <b>Mixed</b> and Native <b>Courts</b> provided an up-to-date and solid system.|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> in Egypt {{was an unusual}} institution. It {{represented}} an international solution {{in the context of}} what was obviously a colonial situation. The system lasted 74 years from 1876 to 1949. A system of law was established whose sources were general codes created especially for use by the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts.</b> The Charter of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> specified two residual sources of law. It is these sources and their application upon which this paper is principally focused. Article 34 reads: 2 ̆ 2 The new Courts, in the exercise of their jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, and within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon them in penal matters, shall apply the codes presented by Egypt to the Powers, and in case of silence, insufficiency, and obscurity of the law, the judge shall follow the principles of natural law and equity. 2 ̆ 2 The language of the Charter was incorporated into article 11 of the Mixed Civil Code of Egypt which stated: 2 ̆ 2 In case of silence, insufficiency, or obscurity of the law, the judge shall apply the principles of natural law and the rules of equity. 2 ̆ 2 Such a provision {{does not appear to have}} a counterpart in other modern legal systems. Neither the Swiss Civil Code nor any other European code permits the judge to make use of these sources of law as the entire basis for a judgment. The discussion of the application of article 34 of the Charter and article 11 of the Mixed Civil Code will be preceded by a description of the origins of the system of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts,</b> of their jurisdiction and organization, of the background of the Mixed Codes, and of their content. The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> operated under the original Charter from 1876 to 1937. The revision of the Charter in 1937, in preparation for the termination of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> which was to take place 12 years later, did not affect article 11 of the Civil Code. Article 52 of the revised Charter reaffirmed the use of natural law and equity in the same terms as article 34 of the original Charter. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from the use of natural law and equity by the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts,</b> the technique itself merits the attention of the jurisprude, the comparativist, and the expert in international law and transnational transactions...|$|R

Designed by Nubar Nubarian Pasha (January 1825, İzmir, Ottoman Empire - January 14, 1899, Paris) {{to be part}} of the Khedive’s great plans for Egypt, the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> led to a radical reform of Egypt’s chaotic nineteenth century legal system, where Consular courts competed with Government tribunals and {{religious}} courts for jurisdiction. The completion of the Suez Canal (1869) and the development of the cotton trade had attracted many foreign interests and foreign nationals to Egypt.|$|R
5000|$|After his {{accomplishment}} in France, Amin {{became a}} part of the British empire's civil servant class. In 1885, he was appointed a jurist in the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts.</b> This court was said to be [...] "saturated" [...] in foreign western influence. The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> created in 1875, was a mixture based on Napoleonic judicial system and Islamic Law. The jurists were foreigners from England, Austria, Germany, and France. Amin held a successful tenure with these foreign based legal officers. The goal of the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> was to control the commercial life of Egypt during its chaotic control by foreign governments and people. The court's governmental tribunal often competed with the religious courts in its decision making. It was noted for its true reflection of the [...] "right way" [...] because it based its judgments on valid and sound reasoning. By 1887, he entered a predominately western- run Egyptian office of the Government Division of Legal Affairs. Within four years, he was selected one of the National courts' Egyptian judges.|$|R

50|$|Foreign influence, and {{diplomatic}} and political claims against the Egyptian government, gave unscrupulous foreigners rights quite inconsistent with natural justice and equity. However, {{the establishment of}} the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> reduced foreign abuse of the Egyptian system. Egypt before 1875 was a battleground of powerful forces. Foreign power was often exercised at the expense of Egyptian sovereignty. All this changed after 1875, as order grew from disorder and legal confidence was established. The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> imposed {{the rule of law and}} thus began the transition of Egypt from a feudal country into a modern and structured state, with a legal climate conducive to commercial and social progress.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Courts</b> had Codes, {{based on}} a civil law format {{inspired}} by the French Civil Code and British common law but with significant Islamic and local principles.

Three courts were established in Cairo, Mansoura and in Alexandria, the proceedings were held in French. Judges were appointed by the Khedive from leading Egyptian and foreign candidates.
