The PIR sensor monitors {{the point of}} operation region, when an human hand reaches the entrance of point of operation, changes in the infrared radiation causes the PIR sensor to fluctuate output signal, using an microcontroller buzzer is given until reset button is pressed manually to indicate emergency situation to the worker and machine will be halted simultaneously.

However, due to various possible designs of safety guards, information about requirements on their fixation is only provided for isolated cases. In the impact test laboratory of the IWF, a broad series of FE simulations and impact tests has been accomplished in order to provide quantitative values to <b>machine</b> tool <b>guard</b> designers. In addition, a method to validate FE simulation results and to determine their reliability is presented.

40|$|The Pentek {{metal coating}} removal system {{consists}} of the ROTO-PEEN Scaler, CORNER-CUTTER(R), and VAC-PAC(R). The system is designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. The Scaler uses 3 M ROTO-PEEN tungsten carbide cutters, while the CORNER-CUTTER(R) uses solid needles for descaling activities. These are used with the VAC-PAC(R) vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on two main areas of exposure: dust and noise. Dust exposure was minimal, but noise exposure was significant. Further testing for each exposure is recommended, since the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may skew the results. It is feasible that dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other areas of concern found were arm-hand vibration, whole-body vibration, ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, electrical hazards, <b>machine</b> <b>guarding,</b> and lockout/tagout...|$|R

The failure to implement machine safety programs related to guarding and lockout/tagout (LOTO) are frequent causes of OSHA citations and may result in serious traumatic injury. MethodsInsurance safety consultants conducted a standardized evaluation of <b>machine</b> <b>guarding,</b> safety programs, and LOTO. Businesses received a baseline evaluation, two intervention visits and a twelve-month follow-up evaluation. ResultsThe intervention was completed by 160 businesses. Adding a safety committee {{was associated with a}} 10 -percentage point increase in business-level machine scores (p< 0. 0001) and a 33 -percentage point increase in LOTO program scores (p < 0. 0001).
