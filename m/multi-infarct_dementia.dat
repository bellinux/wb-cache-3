25|$|The {{symptoms}} of DLB overlap clinically {{with those of}} Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but are associated more commonly with the latter. Because of this overlap, early DLB is often misdiagnosed. The overlap of neuropathological and presenting symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and motor) may make an accurate differential diagnosis difficult. In fact, DLB often is confused {{in its early stages}} with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia (<b>multi-infarct</b> <b>dementia).</b> However, while Alzheimer’s disease usually begins gradually, DLB frequently has a rapid or acute onset, with an especially rapid cognitive and physical decline in the first few months. Thus, DLB tends to progress more rapidly than Alzheimer’s disease. Despite the difficulty, a prompt diagnosis is important because of the risks of sensitivity to certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications and because appropriate treatment of symptoms may improve life for both the person with DLB and the person's caregivers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{symptoms and}} findings in a 57 -year-old painter {{who had been}} exposed to various organic solvents for over 30 years. He began to work as a painter at 16 years of age, frequently working in poorly ventilated areas; he used solvents to remove paint from the skin of his arms and hands {{at the end of each}} work shift. The patient and his family noticed impaired short-term memory function and changes in affect in his early forties, which progressed until after he stopped working and was thus no longer exposed to paints and solvents. After the patient's exposures had ended, serial neuropsychological testing revealed persistent cognitive deficits without evidence of further progression, and improvement in some domains. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed global and symmetrical volume loss, involving more white than gray matter. The findings in this patient are consistent with chronic toxic encephalopathy and are differentiated from other dementing processes such as Alzheimer's disease, <b>multi-infarct</b> (vascular) <b>dementia,</b> and alcoholic dementia. Previous descriptions in the literature of persistent neurobehavioral effects associated with chronic exposure to organic solvents corroborate the findings in this case...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{explored}} the rate of forgetting from long-term memory in Alzheimer's (AD) and <b>multi-infarct</b> (MID) <b>dementia.</b> For this purpose, we administered to 15 AD, 15 MID, and 22 control subjects two tasks exploring, respectively, long-term verbal and long-term visuo-spatial memory. The absolute rate of forgetting in both tasks was computed as the difference between immediate and delayed recall of memorandum. Since level of immediate recall was significantly different between groups, a proportional rate of forgetting (percentage of memorandum lost passing from immediate to delayed recall) was computed for each patient. In the verbal task (Rey's 15 words) AD patients displayed significantly larger absolute and proportional rates of forgetting than MID and control subjects. In the spatial task (Corsi block supraspan), the absolute rate of forgetting was only marginally different between groups. Nevertheless, AD patients demonstrated a larger proportional rate of forgetting than MID and normal subjects. These results point out an exalted decay of information from long-term memory store in AD patients. In the light of previous data (Corkin et al., 1984; Kopelman, 1985) we propose that long-term memory deficits in AD is due, at least in part, to an abnormal forgetting of information within {{the first few minutes}} following acquisition. Information still present in the subsequent period (10 min to several days) is retained normally. The normal rate of forgetting in MID patients, further, suggests different mechanisms underlying memory disorders in vascular and degenerative dementias...|$|R

50|$|The {{recommended}} investigations for {{cognitive impairment}} include: blood tests (for anemia, vitamin deficiency, thyrotoxicosis, infection, etc.), chest X-Ray, ECG, and neuroimaging, preferably a scan with a functional or metabolic sensitivity beyond a simple CT or MRI.

40|$|There remains {{nearly a}} twofold {{increase}} in blacks compared with whites for stroke mortality. The death rate from cerebral hemorrhage in blacks approximates {{twice that of}} whites. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a frequent cause of mortality and morbidity in stroke and is also about twice as frequent in blacks. Lacunar strokes occur more in blacks reflecting increased incidence of hypertension and are leading causes of <b>multi-infarct</b> encephalopathy and <b>dementia.</b> Therefore, the concomitant occurrence of hypertension and stroke is most common in African Americans and requires diagnosis {{of the type of}} stroke, which then defines the rationale of blood pressure control. Cerebral vascular changes associated with acute, chronic, and reactive hypertension are operative. When to treat, when not to treat, and the appropriateness of specific antihypertensive agents in acute stroke are relevant. A common misconception is that the increased blood pressure is the cause of the stroke when it is likely the result of the stroke. Lowering the blood pressure in all acute stroke patients with elevated blood pressure may worsen the neurologic deficit. Thus, the judicious control of blood pressure is to be stressed in the concomitant occurrence of hypertension and stroke...|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{dementia}} appears rarer {{than previously}} thought, but {{the contribution of}} vascular lesions to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected patients (mixed dementias) is now recognized as frequent. The role of strategic {{areas of the brain}} involved in the cognitive decline induced by vascular lesions and their relative contributions to the severity of the dementing process remain poorly understood. We determined the relationship between the severity of clinical dementia and the volume of different brain areas affected by infarcts in a prospective clinicopathological study in elderly patients. A volumetric study of the functional zones of Mesulam's human brain map affected by vascular lesions was made and correlations between quantified neuropathological data and the severity of dementia were performed in cases with large vascular lesions only, pure AD, and both lesions. The severity of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with the total volume of infarcts but in a multi-variate model the volume destroyed in the limbic and heteromodal association areas, including the frontal cortex and in the white matter explained 50 % of the variability in MMSE and GDS. The total volume of ischemic lesions explained only 0. 1 - 5 % of the variability in MMSE and GDS. Age only explained an extra of 0. 1 - 1. 6 %. This study confirms that infarcts located in strategic areas have a role in the mechanism of cognitive impairment and brings a key for their quantification. It may be useful for developing neuropathological criteria in <b>multi-infarct</b> and mixed <b>dementias...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{certain of}} {{pseudodementia}} remains potentially treatable, {{it is essential}} that they are distinguished from primarily dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), and <b>multi-infarct</b> <b>dementia</b> (MID). For instance, pseudodementia associated with depression (DD) has been found as the most frequently appearing, while as many as 10% to 20% patients are misdiagnosed as primary degenerative dementia (PDD) or vice versa. A significant overlapping in cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction in DD and PDD patients seemed to increase the difficulty in diagnosis. However, differences in the severity of impairment and quality of patients' responses could be observed, and DD patients exhibited a greater depressive symptomatology. Additionally, a test of antisaccadic movements may be used to differentiate DD from PDD patients. as PDD patients significantly display poorer performance on this test. A general comparison between aspects of DD and PDD is shown below.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, the journal, Archives of Neurology {{published}} {{a series of}} papers by Hachinski, Harold Merskey and colleagues on the rarefaction of white matter in the brains of elderly people.

Rarefaction of white matter in the brain had already been shown to be correlated with a wide variety of health problems, but these papers were groundbreaking for two reasons especially: First, they introduced the term, “leukoaraiosis,” a word derived by Hachinski, Paul Potter and Harold Merskey to etymologically and Hippocratically describe the rarefaction; and second, they specifically highlighted a previously underappreciated relationship between vascular risk factors for cognitive impairment (i.e., treatable and preventable risk factors for both stroke and <b>multi-infarct</b> <b>dementia)</b> and leukoaraiosis. By coining “leukoaraiosis,” Hachinski drew medical practitioners’ attention to these white matter hypodensities in the brains of patients affected by small strokes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{vascular}} dementia was heavily studied, however by 1910 scientists were lumping Binswanger's disease {{with all other}} subcortical and cortical dementia and labeling everything senile dementia despite all previous research and efforts to distinguish this disease from the rest. In 1962 J. Olszewski published an extensive review of all literature about Binswanger's disease so far.

Even with these errors, Olszewski concluded that Binswanger disease did exist as a subset of cerebral arteriosclerosis. Yet again, in 1974 the term <b>multi-infarct</b> <b>dementia</b> was coined and all vascular dementia was grouped into one category. Because of this, the specific names of these types of this dementia, including Binswanger's disease were lost. This was until 1992 when Alzheimer's diagnostic centers created specific criteria known as the Hachinski Ischemic Scale (after Dr. Vladimir Hachinski) which became the standard for diagnosing MID or vascular dementia.|$|E
