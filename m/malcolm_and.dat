5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend <b>Malcolm,</b> <b>and</b> secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E

5|$|Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, {{challenged}} the bishop's {{authority in the}} north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king put down the rebellion, and Mowbray was captured.

5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown man and his father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still young in 1040, and <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem.

5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park's lead {{computer}} programmer, Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's corporate rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system {{to gain access}} to the embryo storage room where he steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga saga {{reports that}} Malcolm married {{the widow of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a {{daughter}} of Finn Arnesson. Although Ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070, {{it is possible that}} she died much earlier, around 1058. The Orkneyinga Saga records that <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan II (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), who was later king. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the Meic Uilleim. Malcolm's son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned by the author of the Orkneyinga Saga. He is assumed to have been born to Ingibiorg.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, {{slipping}} away from the British ships which had drifted {{to the north and}} anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone.|$|E
5|$|By 1810 the French Navy fleet {{based in}} the Atlantic ports had been {{prevented}} from launching any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of close blockade. A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still {{carried out by the}} Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel. In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and Amazone, commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To blockade these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney <b>Malcolm</b> <b>and</b> HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre. The blockade had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg.|$|E
