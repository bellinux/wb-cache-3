5|$|Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb. Hermann {{claims that}} the Breach will {{stabilize}} and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with a Kaiju’s brain to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side}} of the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.|$|E
5|$|Samus Aran is {{typically}} seen wearing the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters {{and can be}} enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. In regard to offense, the Power Suit boasts the Arm Cannon, which can fire various energy beams, charge beams to shoot an extra-powerful blast, or launch {{a limited number of}} missiles. The Power Suit can also be reconfigured into a small, spherical form called the Morph Ball, which allows her to roll through tight areas, such as tunnels, and use Bombs. The Power Suit is also equipped with a Grapple Beam, which can be used to tether onto objects to cross large distances, such as chasms. Additionally, its visor can be used to scan objects to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> a feature that has been used since Metroid Prime. Aside from her Power Suit, Samus is also in possession of a Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore her health and ammunition.|$|E

Though the Lycian Army repels the bandits, they discover from a local rebel and royal-in-hiding named Elffin that Etruria's nobility have allied with Bern and are enslaving the people on the Western Isles to work the mines. They also learn that Bern has recruited Manaketes, powerful fire dragons who hide their might in human forms. To learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> the Lycian Army travels to Arcadia, a hidden city in the vast desert where humans and dragons live in peace, and gain stronger insight from the elders. A child Manakete named Fae also befriends Roy during his stay and tags along with him. Roy and his forces later returns to Etruria and removes the corrupt nobility, allowing the kingdom's rightful rulers to restore order and the Lycian Army to merge with Etruria's.|$|E

Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl.

School Life is divided up into two sections; Daily Life, where the story simply progresses, and Deadly Life, where players must search for evidence relating to a murder.|$|E

Following this, Otonashi begins helping the other SSS members overcome any regrets they had in life so they can move on. In the process, Otonashi grows closer to the other characters as he learns <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Although the story contains romantic plot lines between Otonashi and each of the heroines, the pasts and conflicts of the characters are not meant to simply enliven the romantic elements, but also provide a significance that goes beyond romance.|$|E

[...] These letters were written as from her characters and intended {{to shed light on}} their doings outside their tales and to tell the recipient <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Each letter was folded to represent an envelope, and addressed to the child recipient. There was a tiny stamp in the corner drawn with a red crayon. They were sent to the children in a miniature post bag marked G.P.O. that Potter had made herself or in a toy tin mail box enamelled bright red.

500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come to know <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence {{was the subject of}} intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how that was happening and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E
500|$|The android {{head nurse}} ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (Jordan Lund) {{also help to}} combat the {{frequent}} medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as [...] "extremely efficient and attractive", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they feel that she sets an impossible standard for them to match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Batung, who {{is part of the}} slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the Chief of Staff Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{said that}} putting dinosaurs on a {{spaceship}} was [...] "the secret of success". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who {{came from the}} special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was a darker opening episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] is more about fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, [...] "Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes [...] "42" [...] (2007), [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood" [...] (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written {{the return of the}} Silurians in [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood", felt that it was [...] "a nice reveal and shows you <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> even in a story that isn’t really about them".|$|E

There's a young man named Crewe over at Leith, for instance--you may have seen him. Not that he's dissipated--but he don't do anything but talk about railroads and the stock market to make you sick, and don't know any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> than my farmer." ...|$|R

500|$|Enid Blyton {{was born}} on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( [...] Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from {{whooping}} cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he [...] "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> than anyone I had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated {{when he left the}} family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.|$|E
500|$|Amy Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. Parks and Recreation staff also felt {{part of the reason for}} the improvement was that the characters have become better developed, and viewers have come to like and care <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Likewise, Michael Schur believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers liked the second season better because they had gotten to know the characters better as the series progressed. Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season, and more distinct from Michael Scott. Several reviewers praised the decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale, like whether Andy and Ann would keep dating, and Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark. Others complimented the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which they said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts. Despite the vast change in critical reception, Parks and Recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to the show itself. Michael Schur said, [...] "I don't think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over the show. I just think we're getting better at it." [...] NBC officials compared the late rush of critical acclaim for Parks and Recreation to that of The Office, which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in the second season.|$|E
500|$|Producers Lindelof and Cuse were {{initially}} {{worried about how}} the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in [...] "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, {{as well as the}} other new characters from the freighter, as [...] "great" [...] and [...] "exciting", writing that: [...] "Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters [...] "fascinating" [...] and wrote that they [...] "totally worked for me, while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more." [...] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback [...] "mind-bending", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] the [...] "perfect introduction" [...] to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they [...] "fit seamlessly into the ensemble", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed [...] "a real cult figure." [...] In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because [...] "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] He appended, however, that this was: [...] "with the possible exception of Frank, who seems a bit too generic-drunk-hippie-guy for now." ...|$|E
