5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic {{hypertriglyceridemia}} {{has been}} reported in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers.</b> However, studies investigating the prevalence of this disorder in a large population of <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are lacking. 192 healthy <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> and 38 healthy dogs of other breeds (control dogs) were enrolled in this study. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were measured and statistically compared between the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> and the control group. Dogs were categorized based on their age, and median serum triglyceride concentrations were compared among different age groups. A total of 63 (32. 8 %) of the 192 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> had serum triglyceride concentrations above the upper limit of the reference range. In contrast, of the 38 control dogs, only 2 (5. 3 %) had serum triglyceride concentrations above the upper limit of the reference range. The median serum triglyceride concentration in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> was 73. 5 mg/dL, which was significantly higher compared to that of the control group (median: 55 mg/dL; p= 0. 0005). Serum cholesterol concentration was above the upper limit of the reference range in 9 (9. 0 %) of 100 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> and in 2 (5. 3 %) of the control dogs. Mean serum cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups (p= 0. 1374). Median serum triglyceride concentrations in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> increased significantly with age (p< 0. 0001), and there was a significant positive correlation between serum triglyceride concentration and age (Spearman r= 0. 47; p< 0. 0001). There was no difference in serum triglyceride concentrations between male and female <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> (p= 0. 48). Healthy <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> had a high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia compared to healthy dogs of other breeds. Both the prevalence and severity of hypertriglyceridemia increased with age. To determine whether hypertriglyceridemia in healthy <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> was associated with increased serum liver enzyme activities, 65 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with normal serum triglyceride concentrations (group 1), 20 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with slightly increased serum triglyceride concentrations (group 2), and 20 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with moderately to severely increased serum triglyceride concentrations (group 3) were evaluated. Questionnaires regarding each dog’s medical history were collected, and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and ã-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities were measured. Median serum ALP activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 or 2, but was not significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. Median serum ALT activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1, but was not significantly different between any of the other groups. Compared with group 1, group 2 and 3 {{were significantly more likely to}} have an increased serum ALP activity (odds ratio, 26. 2 and 192. 6, respectively). Group 3 was also significantly more likely to have an increased serum ALT activity (odds ratio, 8. 0), serum AST activity (odds ratio, 3. 7), or serum GGT activity (odds ratio, 11. 3), than group 1. Group 3 was significantly more likely (odds ratio, 31. 0) to have. 2 high serum liver enzyme activities than was group 1. Results suggested that moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia was associated with high serum liver enzyme activities in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers...</b>|$|R
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis remains obscure in dogs. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate any possible association between hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis in dogs. In the first part of the study, <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with hypertriglyceridemia were found to have significantly higher serum cPLI concentrations than <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with normal serum triglyceride concentrations (P= 0. 0001). Also, <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 862 mg/dL) had 4. 5 times higher odds (P= 0. 0343) for having a serum cPLI concentration consistent with pancreatitis. In the second part of the study, 17 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> prospectively enrolled with a history of pancreatitis were significantly more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia (71 percent) after resolution of pancreatitis than 34 age-matched <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> without a history of pancreatitis (33 percent; odds ratio= 5. 02; P= 0. 0163). For the third part of the study, assessment of the feasibility and usefulness of a novel density gradient ultracentrifugation method using NaBiEDTA for lipoprotein profiling in dogs was attempted. Density gradient ultracentrifugation using NaBiEDTA was found to be useful for the study of lipoprotein profiles in dogs. Significant differences were detected in the lipoprotein profiles (mainly involving TRL and specific LDL fractions) among healthy <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers,</b> dogs of various other breeds, and hypertriglyceridemic <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers.</b> In the fourth part of the study, the effect of a commercially available low-fat diet on serum lipid and pancreas-specific lipase (Spec cPL) concentrations and lipoprotein profiles in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with primary hypertriglyceridemia was evaluated. The study diet was found to be effective in significantly reducing serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and changing the lipoprotein profiles of the dogs studied within 2 months. However, there was no significant effect of the study diet on serum Spec cPL concentrations. In the last part of the study, serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and lipoprotein profiles were compared between dogs with naturally occurring pancreatitis and healthy dogs. The majority of dogs with naturally occurring pancreatitis had normal serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. Important differences were identified in lipoprotein profiles between dogs with pancreatitis (higher LDL 2, LDL 3, and LDL 4 fractions and lower TRL, HDL 2 a, and HDL 3 c fractions) and healthy control dogs...|$|R
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer is {{a working}} breed of dog {{developed}} in the 17th century in Germany. It is {{the largest of the}} three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer.</b> Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary {{hypothyroidism}} is {{a common}} endocrinopathy in dogs. In contrast, central hypothyroidism is rare in this species. Objectives: The objective {{of this article is}} to describe the occurrence and clinical presentation of central hypothyroidism in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers.</b> Additionally, the possible role of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) -releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene and the TSH beta (TSHB) gene was investigated. Animals: <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with proven central hypothyroidism, based on scintigraphy, and the results of a 3 -day-TSH-stimulation test, or a TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) -stimulation test or both, presented to the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals at Utrecht University or the Department of Medicine and Clinical Biology of Small Animals at Ghent University from 2008 to 2012. Methods: Retrospective study. Pituitary function tests, thyroid scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) of the pituitary area were performed. Gene fragments of affected dogs and controls were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of the products were analyzed. Results: Central hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 7 <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers.</b> Three dogs had disproportionate dwarfism and at least one of them had a combined deficiency of TSH and prolactin. No disease-causing mutations were found in the TSHB gene and the exons of the TRHR gene of these Schnauzers. Conclusions and clinical importance: Central hypothyroidism could be underdiagnosed in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> with hypothyroidism, especially in those of normal stature. The fact that this rare disorder occurred in 7 dogs from the same breed suggests that central hypothyroidism could have a genetic background in <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzers...</b>|$|R
500|$|The beagle has an even {{temper and}} gentle disposition. Described in several breed {{standards}} as [...] "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this {{depends on the}} individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer,</b> West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Miniature</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is a {{breed of}} small dog of the Schnauzer type that {{originated}} in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers developed from crosses between the Standard Schnauzer {{and one or}} more smaller breeds such as the Poodle and Affenpinscher, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as [...] "spunky" [...] but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.|$|E

40|$|The plasma lipoproteins of 6 {{clinically}} healthy lipemic <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> (HLMS), 11 {{clinically healthy}} non-lipemic <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> (HNMS), and 3 diabetic lipemic <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> (DLMS) were evaluated {{through the use}} of ultracentrifugation, lipoprotein electrophoresis, and biochemical tests. For comparison, the plasma lipoproteins of 8 healthy dogs of other breeds (HDOB) and 3 diabetic dogs of other breeds (DDOB) were similarly evaluated. Lipemia ranged from slight to marked in the HLMSs, and was marked in the DLMSs. The HDOBs and DDOBs all had clear plasma. Four of the HNMSs had historical evidence of fasting lipemia, yet had clear plasma when sampled for the present study. ^ The lipemic <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> (HLMSs and DLMSs) all had hypertriglyceridemia associated with excess VLDL, and the most markedly lipemic dogs had chylomicronemia as well. Hypercholesterolemia and hyperphospholipidemia were present in dogs with marked lipemia; all or most of these excess lipids were associated with the VLDL and chylomicrons. Four of the HLMSs lacked detectable amounts of LDL. Four of the HNMSs had mild hypertriglyceridemias associated with increased amounts of VLDL, and all 4 of these dogs lacked LDL. Two of the hypertriglyceridemic HNMSs were dogs with historical evidence of fasting lipemia. The plasma lipoproteins of the DDOBs were essentially indistinguishable from those of the HDOBs, whereas the lipoproteins of the DLMSs were very {{similar to those of the}} most markedly lipemic HLMSs. ^ The results indicate that the hyperlipidemia of <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> is due to a familial disorder resulting in delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. It appears likely that, while some affected dogs have only a type IV hyperlipoproteinemia due to the effects of the familial disorder alone, others have converted to type V hyperlipoproteinemia because of complicating conditions, such as a high fat diet or development of acquired diseases that also cause hypertriglyceridemia. The familial disorder of the <b>miniature</b> <b>schnauzers</b> bears similarities to familial hypertriglyceridemia in humans.

40|$|Selective {{immunoglobulin}} A (IgA) deficiency is {{the most}} common primary immunodeficiency in humans and may be associated with chronic gastrointestinal disease. This observation has led to the suggestion that the high susceptibility of German shepherd dogs (GSD) to chronic enteropathies is related to a deficiency in mucosal IgA production. Relative deficiencies of IgA has been reported in the serum, saliva, tears, and feces of GSD both with and without alimentary disease; however, the findings of different studies are not consistent. The aim {{of this study was to}} confirm whether a relative deficiency of IgA exists in the feces of GSD.

These findings do not support the hypothesis that GSD have a relative deficiency in fecal IgA. The differences in immunoglobulin concentrations measured from a single defecation, between individuals of the same breed and between breeds, as well as the lack of an internal control molecule, make the determination of a normal reference range for all dogs impossible.
