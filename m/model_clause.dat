40|$|Review of the IKEv 2 -SCSI {{specification}} {{has identified}} text that is incorrect when digital signatures {{are used for}} authentication. The erroneous text specifies that the recipient calculates the expected authentication value. This is applicable when a shared secret key is used for authentication (Shared Key Message Integrity Code), but is incorrect when a digital signature is used. This is because a digital signature is computed with the sender's private key, but the recipient checks it with the sender's public key. Asymmetric cryptography is used, so the recipient can check the signature, but cannot reproduce the signature on its own. In considering how to correct this problem, a need has emerged for <b>model</b> <b>clause</b> material on IKEv 2 -SCSI authentication. This document proposes to add that <b>model</b> <b>clause,</b> {{where most of the}} corrections reside, and make the necessary changes elsewhere.

40|$|While clause {{resolution}} {{is central to}} logic programming, practical efforts to optimize resolution have largely concerned efficient clause indexing. One recent exception is Unification Factoring [5], which optimizes backtracking through clause heads of a predicate. Now we consider the problem of optimizing clause resolution in a more general setting than Unification Factoring. One fundamental change is to use mode information to distinguish between elementary matching and unification operations that arise in unifying a term. In addition, we expand the traditional notion of clause resolution to allow for tabled predicates. The result is that our optimization technique becomes relevant for both top-down and bottom-up evaluations. Our technique uses Clause Resolution Automata (CRA), to <b>model</b> <b>clause</b> resolution in this expanded setting. The CRAs enable us to succinctly capture the cost of resolution. Furthermore, they can be readily implemented as a source transformation. After formally deve [...] ...|$|E
