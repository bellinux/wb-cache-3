[...] Because of his {{repeated}} job changes, the Associated Press dubbed Shaugnessy [...] "football's man in motion". At Maryland, he replaced Bear Bryant who had departed for Kentucky. Shaughnessy reintroduced his preferred red and white uniforms, which again replaced the black and gold scheme and remained the dominant colors until 1987.|$|E
500|$|Robin Hester {{played by}} Benjamin Jay, was a {{teenager}} who formed a crush on Sunny and tried to ruin her relationship with Zeke. Digital Spy said Robin [...] "goes to drastic lengths to keep Zeke and Sunny apart" [...] and Holy Soap and Jay labelled him as [...] "creepy". Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so he could spend time with her. Lee named the storyline with Robin as her favourite from her time in the show. She said [...] "That {{was probably the best}} storyline ever because it gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> show who Sunny Lee was".|$|E

500|$|Fourteen-year-old {{country music}} singer Virginia [...] "Ginny" [...] Hensley, {{who later became}} Patsy Cline, began her career by making her {{broadcast}} debut on WINC in 1948. Hensley asked [...] "Joltin'" [...] Jim McCoy, {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] called [...] "The Melody Playboys", about to perform on the station, for a chance to sing with them. She told the band leader, [...] "If you just give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> sing with you, I'll never ask for pay." [...] Cline continued to perform regularly on Saturday mornings on WINC. [...] In 1948 and 1949, respectively, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope visited WINC, where they were interviewed on-the-air. Crosby and Hope were each in town for the city's annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable aspect of Johnson's game was his {{blocking}} abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying [...] "It gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> hit {{all those people who}} hit me all the time." [...] Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. [...] "By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough," [...] said Layne. [...] "I don't mean dirty." [...] Layne also called Johnson his [...] "bodyguard," [...] saying [...] "Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough.

500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I."

500|$|The main theme {{emphasized}} in the series is the environment. Holmes says that by [...] "coming up with a series about a different animal gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> explore some themes that don't fit so easily into Warriors. In particular, the environment." [...] Holmes says that {{she has always been}} keen on recycling and saving the planet so she wanted to explore the ways bears and other animals might react to humans destroying their homes and habitats. Many reviewers have picked up the theme. Publishers Weekly found that [...] "readers will appreciate the bears' struggle to survive, along with Hunter's environmental theme." [...] Booklist also commented on each separate story of the three bears touch on environmental problems and issues. School Library Journal noted that [...] "The bears' declining habitat is evident, and often throughout their journey the animals have to dodge cars and humans with guns." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1994 season, the Elias Sports Bureau {{informed}} the Orioles that Ripken had surpassed Ernie Banks for most career home runs as a shortstop with his 278th on July 15 against Scott Erickson. Banks met Ripken {{at a ceremony}} on February 9 and said, [...] "I'm extremely happy that he broke this record because it give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> come back and be remembered too."

On August 1, he played in his 2,000th consecutive game, a 1–0 victory over the Twins at the Metrodome. Through 112 games, Ripken batted [...]315 with 13 home runs and 75 RBI before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cancelled {{the rest of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E

And then, he caught the eye of Rajasthan Royals' Shane Watson, who had watched him score an 80-ball hundred in a session in the second innings of a three-day game against Australia A in 2010. Having bought him from the Mumbai Indians, Rahul Dravid and Watson got Rahane to open the innings.

It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> say thank you and goodbye.
