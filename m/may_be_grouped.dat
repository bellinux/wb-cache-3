5|$|Candide {{contains}} thirty episodic chapters, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> {{into two}} main schemes: one {{consists of two}} divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, {{the first half of}} Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.|$|E

The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> together.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social {{programs such as}} health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E

These four sampradayas emerged in early centuries of the 2nd millennium CE, by the 14th century, influencing and sanctioning the Bhakti movement.|$|E

25|$|Vicente's oeuvre {{spans the}} years between 1500 and 1536. Most of his plays were {{intended}} for performance at court, where he and the {{ladies and gentlemen of}} the court participated in their production. He wrote no fewer than forty-four pieces, ten of which are in Spanish, fourteen in Portuguese, and the remainder in mingled Portuguese and Spanish. His plays <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into four main categories: acts, or devotional plays; comedies tragicomedies; and farces.|$|E
25|$|Free-standing sculptures <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into a Nativity scene (crib, creche or presepe) {{within or}} outside a church, home, public place or natural setting. The {{scale of the}} figures may range from {{miniature}} to life-sized. These Nativity scenes probably derived from acted tableau vivants in Rome, although Saint Francis of Assisi gave the tradition a great boost. This tradition continues to this day, with small versions made of porcelain, plaster, plastic or cardboard sold for display in the home. The acted scenes evolved into the Nativity play.|$|E

According to ESHRE recommendations, couples with an estimated live birth rate of 40% or higher per year are encouraged to continue aiming for a spontaneous pregnancy. Treatment methods for infertility <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> as medical or complementary and alternative treatments. Some methods {{may be used in}} concert with other methods. Drugs used for both women and men include clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, aromatase inhibitors, and metformin.|$|E

25|$|With these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> {{the music}} of Sudan and of the Horn of Africa, {{including}} {{the music of}} Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. Somali music is typically pentatonic, using five pitches per octave {{in contrast to a}} heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. The music of the Ethiopian highlands uses a fundamental modal system called qenet, of which there are four main modes: tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy. Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor. Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} {{role in the}} telling of a story through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, stars and the moon are important both for religious significance and as an illustration of Chinese mythology. Symbols used in art <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into four overarching categories: religious imagery, divine and mortal beings, symbols from nature and inanimate objects. Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month. The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.|$|E
25|$|Aquaria <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> {{by their}} species selection. The {{community}} tank {{is the most}} common today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.|$|E
