This conclusion is the most parsimonious biogeographic explanation with nearest populations of A. m. macrodactylum separated by approximately 300km across the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California. The isolated endemic populations are listed as an endangered subspecies. Based on the biogeography and <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> calibrations, this subspecies may have been separated from the remainder of the distribution since the Miocene, <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> calibrations estimating 13.9 million years of separation.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E
5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been {{contemporaneous}} with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8mya.|$|E

5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of {{molecular}} biology, and with it {{an understanding of the}} chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the <b>molecular</b> <b>clock,</b> arguing that—at the molecular level at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations.|$|E

It is unclear how to integrate data from many genes, each potentially evolving under a different model of substitution and at a different rate.

5|$|Based on <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, {{as part of a larger}} evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms.

5|$|Dentition is the {{key feature}} by which fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic.

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>clock</b> {{evidence}} using DNA {{suggests the}} macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5million years ago. Although {{the two have}} generally been considered separate species, the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the <b>molecular</b> <b>clock</b> can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of relations, divergence times, and diversification patterns among extant mammalian families {{have relied on}} supertree methods and local <b>molecular</b> <b>clocks.</b> We constructed a molecular supermatrix for mammalian families and analyzed these data with likelihood-based methods and relaxed <b>molecular</b> <b>clocks.</b> Phylogenetic analyses resulted in a robust phylogeny with better resolution than phylogenies from supertree methods.
