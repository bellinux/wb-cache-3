500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I ♥ Huckabees.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were more}} {{tempered}} in their praise. James Poniewozik of Time said the episode was [...] "grounded" [...] and [...] "solid-if-not-spectacular", and highlighted how Glee [...] "has {{developed into a}} broad ensemble, where any of several characters is capable of taking the spotlight, even an originally comic-relief character like Brittany." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson both liked the episode—VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "B+"—but they, like Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone who was less complimentary, were disappointed that it failed to measure {{up to the last}} time New Directions competed in Sectionals. VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "When the show [...] remains, at some level, a show about a bunch of kids who just love to sing and dance and <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> wacky adventures on the side, it remains fundamentally strong, as it does tonight." [...] He also stated, [...] "The fact that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while probably necessary for whatever reason, is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an A- pretty much singlehandedly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Peñate {{told the}} NME that [...] "Tonight's Today", [...] "is {{very much about}} <b>maybe</b> <b>having</b> too much fun. Fun can be addictive, when things don't really seem to matter or be understood." ...|$|R

500|$|Michael Cragg of The Guardian gave a {{positive}} review for {{the video and}} wrote: [...] "Superstars are at their best when they're simultaneously aware and unaware of their own ridiculousness and that's what Marry the Night delivers for Lady Gaga." [...] Daily News Kathryn Kattalia compared Gaga with Madonna in several scenes in the video. Kattalia further praised the dancing during the video, describing it as [...] "her best". However, she criticized the scenes of nudity noting: [...] "The rest of the video is pretty tame by Gaga standards." [...] Spins Marc Hogan wrote that [...] "it's hard to tell where Gaga is winking at us and where she's simply fallen into a foxhole of unrestrained ego." [...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries." [...] Leah Collins of Dose compared Gaga's outfits with Christian Louboutin's designs. She further compared the set in the video to the cover artwork of Born This Way and called it a [...] "very fashionable recreation of Girl, Interrupted." [...] A writer of CNN commented, [...] "Lady Gaga is known for creating evocative mini-movies to provide the visuals for her singles, and 'Marry the Night' is no different." [...] Describing the video as [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "enigmatic", Liz Raftery of People further commened that it [...] "will certainly leave fans talking, if not scratching their heads." [...] An editor of ABC News praised Gaga's [...] "interesting perspective in the video." [...] NMEs Priya Elan wrote that Gaga sounds like [...] "a lobotomized Carrie Bradshaw" [...] during the introduction. He also commented, [...] "It's definitely an improvement on 'Judas', but could it <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> been snipped a bit to make it shorter?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mic {{organized}} {{a list of}} [...] "5 Reasons Claire Huxatable (sic) is the Ultimate Feminist Mom", and The Huffington Post crowned The Cosby Show [...] "One of the Most Feminist Shows of All Time" [...] due to individual contributions from both Clair and Cliff. Dubbed the [...] "feminist rant" [...] by media publications, Clair's speech to future son-in-law Elvin about gender roles in marriage in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love" [...] is often lauded {{as one of the}} character's greatest moments, to which the studio audience responded with enthusiastic applause. CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you work, and you identify as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent chance you or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted to be beautiful, be successful, and <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> a great family and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 1982 US Open, Evert had {{an easier}} time in {{dispatching}} her opponent Mandlíková in the final, than she had two years prior. [...] It was due to a high propensity of double faults and errant shot making, which allowed Evert even though some suspect serving of her own was able to preserve games on her racket. [...] In the fourth game of the match, Evert had a break point against her serve, but would not give it up. [...] After the match was knotted at 3-games all, Mandlíková was serving in the seventh game of the match, which she was incapable of holding serve. [...] In the next subsequent game, Evert was faced with three break points on serve. [...] Yet, unlike the Czechoslovakian, was able {{to fend off the}} points, which was a game consisting of five deuce points. [...] In the ninth game of the set, Evert broke Mandlíková again, which came off of a backhand volley in the net, and the set was won at six games to three in just 33 minutes. [...] The second set lasted only 31 minutes, and Evert won it in a romp at six games to one in a total match time of 64 minutes. [...] This win gave her the sixth US Open title for her career, which was over an eight-year timespan, which Evert said [...] "the first time you win Wimbledon or the US Open is really a thrill, but I appreciate and <b>maybe</b> <b>have</b> a place in history by winning a sixth, so I can understand that a little better." ...|$|E
