50|$|The field {{record type}} is an {{abbreviation}} {{for the type}} of information stored in the last field, record data. The type also provides the name of each record. For example, an address record, having the identifier A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6, maps the domain name from the first field to an IP address in the record data, and a mail exchanger record (MX) specifies the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) <b>mail</b> <b>host</b> for a domain.|$|E

50|$|KIS {{consists}} of two distinct types of modules which {{interact with each other}} (typically across a network) to provide the service. One module is a user agent module that runs on the KIS <b>mail</b> <b>host</b> machine. The second module is a remote server module (possibly on a different machine) that interrogates various database services across the network and provides the results to the user agent module in a uniform fashion. Interactions between the two modules can be via messages between Knowbots or by actual movement of Knowbots.|$|E
30|$|Some {{autonomous}} systems (10297 and 29802) {{have similar}} characteristics {{in virtually all}} aspects. They have {{a small number of}} IP addresses in our dataset, most of them using SOCKS and HTTP protocols to send spam, and do not belong to any blacklist. AS 2497 is also very similar, despite having a larger number of machines. AS 4725, in turn, differs only by having a large number of IP addresses in PBL blacklist. The machines of those neighborhoods behave like dedicated servers used to send spam: they use SOCKS and HTTP protocols, meaning they do not contact any <b>mail</b> <b>host</b> directly (only through proxies), each sends a large number of messages, {{and most of them are}} not in any blacklist.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{advantage}} {{of this process is}} that it is generally transparent to the average user who will be connecting with an email client, which will almost always make a connection to fetch new mail before sending new mail. The disadvantages include a potentially complex setup for the <b>mail</b> <b>hosting</b> provider (requiring some sort of communication channel between the POP service and the SMTP service) and uncertainty as to how much time users will take to connect via SMTP (to send mail) after connecting to POP.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to 2011, {{there was}} no {{standard}} list of email addresses {{that could be used}} for domain validation, so it was not clear to email administrators which addresses needed to be reserved. The first version of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, adopted November 2011, specified a list of such addresses. This allowed <b>mail</b> <b>hosts</b> to reserve those addresses for administrative use, though such precautions are still not universal.

40|$|Abstract: Mail systems {{comprise}} different {{components to}} accomplish all mail activities. On {{the top of}} these mail system functions is the message submission, delivery, and retrieval on a target <b>host.</b> Simple <b>Mail</b> Transfer Protocol (SMPT) is the mail transport protocol used to transfer <b>mail</b> between <b>hosts.</b> In SMTP session, like any protocol, two participants are involved. The first is the client that initiates the session and manages connection by sending requests. The other, which is the server, waits for such requests that trigger responses. This paper presents an enhanced messages delivery approach through a proposed SMTP client. A proposed architecture implementation is presented {{as well as the}} algorithm workflow for processing mails by the SMTP client. The paper provides a per-host grouping strategy that minimizes the delivery time of messages queue to multiple hosts by processing all messages belonging to the same <b>host</b> <b>mail</b> server as a one bulk. A comparative study for messages delivery with and without the grouping mechanism proved a significant reduction the the time for delivering a queue of messages. In addition to grouping, the features contributed in threading and session handling, prioritized delivery, and pipelining enhanced the way and performance of mails delivery to destination hosts...|$|R
