This model {{was followed by the}} release of two Fender signature Stratocaster electric guitars, beginning in 2005. A third Stratocaster, finished in charcoal frost metallic paint with a racing stripe, was also a limited-release, with only 100 guitars made. In January 2006, Martin Guitars released the Martin OMJM John Mayer acoustic guitar. The guitar was intended to have many of the attributes of the Martin OM-28 John Mayer but with a more affordable price tag. In August 2006, Fender started <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SERIES</b> II John Mayer Stratocasters.|$|E

40|$|Regular balloon ozone {{soundings}} with electrochemical sondes {{have been}} performed at Uccle since 1969. More than 450 ozone soundings between 1985 and 1989 were {{used to calculate the}} altitudes Zs from the VIZ radiosonde data and the altitudes Zr deduced from the tracking of the balloon train with a primary wind-finding radar. The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different <b>manufacturing</b> <b>series</b> of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>series</b> of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or Umkehr measurements may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of ozone observed from soundings with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs. The agreement between altitudes calculated from radar data and Vaisala radiosondes is much better; from 34 comparative soundings a mean difference (plus or minus standard deviation) of about - 300 plus/minus 180 m was found at 30 km...|$|E

40|$|Machining induced {{residual}} stress states {{contribute to the}} distortion of machined components during heat treatments. Thus, ideally a complete characterization of the components {{residual stress}} state is required. Magnetic and micromagnetic analysis of residual stresses can represent an important gain of time if compared to X-ray diffraction. Another important advantage is the access of inner faces of components like ball bearing rings. This study presents a comparison of these two methods for the characterization of outer and inner surfaces of ball bearing rings. A good calibration of micromagnetic measurements with X-ray diffraction data is necessary. Reliable results then can be achieved and the residual stress states of rings can be characterized. Effects of clamping systems and feed on the residual stress levels and distribution will be discussed, as well as complex interactions. An implementation of the presented micromagnetic method for non-destructive control in large <b>manufacturing</b> <b>series</b> could be possible...|$|E
40|$|Product {{manufacturers}} {{are faced with}} a constant decrease in product development time, short product life cycles and an increase of complexity of the products. At the same time, it {{is becoming more and more}} difficult to justify the expected product features while satisfying the requirements of the trends like eco-design, resource efficiency, light weight design and individualization. These developments are key characteristics which favor the growing role and importance of additive manufacturing (AM). Additive Manufacturing techniques such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are transitions from building prototypes to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>series</b> products within short time and with highest requirements regarding material characteristics as well as product performance. Product performance is one of the main drivers of the creation of multi-material composites. These composites, existing of a matrix and embedded fibers, are more and more used in various industries not just the aerospace and automotive industry. They offer a solution to the light-weight requirements amongst others. Yet, so far the manufacturing of composites is only partially automated; it requires a lot of manual labor and is typically requiring tools resulting in added costs. A combination or integration of additive and composite manufacturing is very limited to not existing, being an indicator for the difficulties to bring these two technologies together. To meet this challenge the 3 D Fiber Print has been developed. It is an AM method using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and composites in process simultaneously while manufacturing a product. The products are still manufactured layer-wise, with each layer containing a composite on-demand. The newly developed and patented print head is designed in the way that composite and matrix material are applied in the right setup and ration using a nozzle style print head to completely embed the composite.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the seasonal patterns of five Turkish <b>manufacturing</b> industry <b>series</b> which have the main characteristics of Turkish economy during the 1977 : 1 - 2008 : 4 periods. Many economic time series are often subject to systematic fluctuations within the year such as seasonal movements. All the studies concerning time series methods are useful only when the series do not show seasonal patterns or the methods that care of seasonal patterns used. For this reason, it is important to investigate the seasonal patterns of the series when working with economic time series data. The analysis is conducted using the HEGY approach developed by Hylleberg, Engle, Granger and Yoo (1990). It is important to determine what kind of seasonality is present in the data. For this reason, we search for the seasonal unit root with five different models that concern, trends, constant and seasonal dummies. We provide evidence on the presence of seasonal unit roots in the Turkish <b>manufacturing</b> industry <b>series.</b> The main finding is that there are both deterministic and non-stationary stochastic seasonality in the series...|$|R
