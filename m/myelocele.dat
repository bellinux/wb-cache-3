50|$|Spina bifida with <b>Myelocele</b> is {{the most}} severe form of myelomeningocele. In this type, the {{involved}} area is represented by a flattened, plate-like mass of nervous tissue with no overlying membrane. The exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to life-threatening infections such as meningitis.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the infants}} with spina bifida {{referred}} to a neonatal surgical unit over three years and denied early closure of the <b>myelocele,</b> a significant proportion survived long enough for procedures to drain hydrocephalus to be needed. The key decision {{in the management of}} this condition is not whether myeloceles should be closed but whether hydrocephalus should be treated...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} control of 11 infants with severe abnormalities {{of the central}} nervous system has been investigated. 4 were normothermic and 7 poikilothermic. Necropsy of the latter showed that either the hypothalamus was absent or disorganized, or the long tracts through the brainstem were unidentifiable, or in one case interrupted by a cervical <b>myelocele.</b> The lateral horn cells, sympathetic nervous system, and brown fat appeared normal...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Encephalocele and <b>myelocele</b> are {{deformities}} of easy clinical diagnosis, however, in {{some cases}} this diagnosis can be complicated for the clinical signs and complaints' absence. Objective: The present study intends to report {{the case of a}} two-year-old patient of the male sex with a trans sphenoidal meningocele without symptomatology associated to discrete alterations in the physical exam and treated through endoscopic transnasal surgery. Case Report: Trans sphenoidal meningocele' surgery treatment in a two-year-old patient, through endoscopic transnasal surgery, using bilateral septal nasal mucosa shred, pedicellate in the sphenopalatine artery. Conclusion: The meningoencephalocele approach, using septal nasal mucosa it is showed a viable and effective option in pediatric patients...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Familial data on neural tube malformations in Great Britain were {{submitted}} to segre-gation analysis under the mixed model. Maternal and fetal factors cannot be discriminated {{in the absence}} of substantial bodies of data on spina bifida survivors who reproduce or on half-sibs. Early abortion studies would allow differential mortality in utero to be taken into account. After fitting the mixed and generalised single locus models, it is concluded that the multifactorial model can provisionally be used for calculation of recurrence risks. Pathogenic hypotheses implicating twinning seem to rest on little evidence. Epidemiological features and the pattern of familial aggregation of neural tube malformations suggest genetic as well as environmental factors at play in their causation. Two large bodies of data from Britain are sub-mitted to segregation analysis under the mixed model (Morton and MacLean, 1974), and the best fitting model is used for calculation of specific recurrence risks. Neural tube malformations This term covers a variety of congenital malforma-tions-anencephaly, iniencephaly, encephalocele, <b>myelocele,</b> and meningocele (but not hydrocephalus) -sharing a number of epidemiological features which, together with their co-occurrence in families (Carter et al., 1968; Smith, 1976), suggest that they have a common aetiology. In family studies, it is usual to include encephalocele, meningocele, and <b>myelocele</b> with spina bifida cystica, and iniencephaly with anencephaly. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES The frequency of neural tube malformations among all births, live and stillbirths, has been found to vary with time, space, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, sex, maternal age, and parity. This frequency varies by a factor of three in various communit...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{operative}} specimens from 160 {{cases of}} {{spina bifida cystica}} were examined in detail. In seven cases the sac contained nervous tissue {{visible to the naked}} eye, the removal of which produced no clinical disability. The form taken by this non-functioning, heterotopic nervous tissue is described. In the more severe forms of spina bifida cystica in which the spinal cord or nerves extend into the sac (meningomyelocele) or are exposed on the skin sur-face (<b>myelocele),</b> minute heterotopic nests of glial tissue with or without ependymal canals are fre-quently found in the surrounding meninges or sub-cutaneous tissues (Lichtenstein, 1940; Cameron, 1957). Fisher (1950), reviewing a large series of operative specimens from cases of spina bifida cystica, found heterotopic nervous tissue in more than half and stated that in many of these no clinica...|$|E
40|$|Spina bifida is a {{congenital}} deformity of posterior wall of vertebra of spine. This is a midline defect of skin, vertebral arches and neural tube, {{usually in the}} lumbosacral re-gion. The incidence usually ranges from 0. 2 - 0. 4 / 1000 live births(l). Little {{is known about the}} etiology of the spina bifida. It may take any of the following forms(2) : (i) Spina bifida occulta is due to failure of neural arches to unite, but there is no protrusion of cord or membrane. The spina bifida occulta is an isolated, insignificant finding in about 20 % of all spines examined roentgeno-graphically; (ii) Spina bifida manifesto commonly takes one of the following forms (a) Meningocele, (b) Meningomyelocele. Other rate forms may be (c) Syringo-Myelocele, and (d) <b>Myelocele.</b> Gupta, et al. (3) demonstrated that the placenta permits a limited passage of fluo-ride to the fetal circulation. Gedalia et al. (4) showed that once fluoride enters the feta...|$|E
40|$|Neural tube defects (NTDs) {{are one of}} the commonest malformations seen in {{pediatric}} surgical practice. They form {{a spectrum}} of disease ranging from anencephaly to spina bifida occulta. NTDs are devastating conditions as most of the lesions (myelomeningoceles, <b>myelocele</b> etc.) are always associated with neurological deficits producing varying degree of limb paresis/paralysis, bladder and anorectal incontinence. A significiant number also have or later on develop hydrocephalus with its attendant complications following shunt surgery. Thus NTDs offer a tremendous challenge in management, that requires the co-ordination and co-operation of many specialists with an aim to rehabilitate and integrate these handicapped patients with a satisfying life in to the society. This may be an ideal and true situation in the West but in a developing country like India, it is a difficult task as most of the patients are poor and their number is so large requiring huge resources for their treatment and rehabilitation. In the given scenario, the emphasis should on antenatal prevention, diagnosis and treatment and in postnatal period on selective management...|$|E
40|$|Experience {{with the}} {{diagnosis}} of neural tube defects from alpha 1 -fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations in amniotic fluid is reported from a prospective study of five laboratories testing for 13 Canadian genetic centres. The {{results of the study}} indicate that antenatal diagnosis of open neural tube defects is being carried out effectively in Canada (in 99. 2 % of cases the AFP measurements were interpreted correctly). Amniocentesis should be recommended to women at high risk for having a child with a neural tube defect (i. e., those who have a child, a parent or a sibling with a neural tube defect). The rate of neural tube defects in 182 high-risk pregnancies was 2. 2 % for an open defect and 1. 1 % for a closed defect, whereas the rate in 673 pregnancies in which amniocentesis was being performed for other reasons was 0. 3 %. This suggests that the AFP concentration should be measured in any sample of amniotic fluid collected for other reasons (usually fetal karyotyping). There were three instances of false-negative results, for a rate of 0. 4 %. Two closed neural tube defects were not detected; this limitation of the test has also been found by others. One of the six fetuses with an open neural tube defect, who died in utero, had a large <b>myelocele</b> in the neck that was not recognized. There were also four instances of false-positive results, for a rate of 0. 5 %. The findings suggest that AFP values that are more than 2 but less than 7 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean may indicate a neural tube defect, and that values 7 or more SDs above the mean very likely indicate such a defect, although other reasons for such high values (e. g., fetal erythrocytes in the amniotic fluid, intrauterine death and mistaken gestational age) must be ruled out by other methods...|$|E
