However, it can be also noted that the complexities of transfer and <b>momentum</b> <b>terms</b> are comparable to those of the core M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes, and therefore, the addition of transfer and <b>momentum</b> <b>terms</b> influences the complexities of M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes more noticeably.|$|R

40|$|As {{the first}} step to extend our {{understanding}} of higher-derivative theories, within the framework of analytic mechanics of interacting particles, we construct a ghost-free theory involving third-order time derivative in Lagrangian. We clarify that there is a crucial difference in construction from up-to-second-order-derivative theories. While eliminating linear <b>momentum</b> <b>terms</b> in the Hamiltonian is necessary and sufficient to kill the ghosts associated with the higher derivatives for the Lagrangian with up to second-order derivatives, this is necessary but not sufficient for the Lagrangian with higher than second-order derivatives. We demonstrate that even after eliminating the linear <b>momentum</b> <b>terms</b> ghosts are still lurking {{and they need to be}} removed appropriately to make Lagrangian free from the ghosts. We clarify a set of ghost-free conditions under which we show that the Hamiltonian is bounded, and that equations of motion are reducible into a second-order system. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|A whole-body {{torque control}} {{framework}} adapted for balancing and walking tasks {{is presented in}} this paper. In the proposed approach, centroidal <b>momentum</b> <b>terms</b> are excluded {{in favor of a}} hierarchy of high-priority position and orientation tasks and a low-priority postural task. More specifically, the controller stabilizes the position of the center of mass, the orientation of the pelvis frame, as well as the position and orientation of the feet frames. The low-priority postural task provides reference positions for each joint of the robot. Joint torques and contact forces to stabilize tasks are obtained through quadratic programming optimization. Besides the exclusion of centroidal <b>momentum</b> <b>terms,</b> part of the novelty of the approach lies in the definition of control laws in SE(3) which do not require the use of Euler parameterization. Validation of the framework was achieved in a scenario where the robot kept balance while walking in place.
