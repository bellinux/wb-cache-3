25|$|A {{basic premise}} of the setting is that as the world endured the string of state-changing events and conflicts, the {{political}} landscape fragmented and reformed. In North America, for example, some nations broke apart and reformed, {{as was the case}} with the Confederation of American States and the United Canadian and American States, while others became havens for specific racial or ethnic groups, like Native American Nations (the Native Americans having used their newfound magical abilities to regain massive tracts of land) or the Elvish principality of Tír Tairngire, which encompasses all of the state of Oregon. Some, like the California Free State, simply declared independence, while yet others became de facto corporate subsidiaries like Aztlan (the former Mexico), the headquarters of the Aztechnology megacorp. Despite the new role of megacorporations, many nations still hold considerable sway through economic, social and military means. For most people, “getting by” <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> advantage of whatever the corps or the government might bring their way.|$|E

That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

2500|$|Teresa {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences. Her deep insight and analytical gifts helped her to explain them clearly. Her definition was used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: [...] "Contemplative prayer [...] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us." [...] She used a metaphor of mystic prayer as watering a garden throughout her writings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} of solid drawing <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> into account forms in three-dimensional space, or giving them volume and weight. [...] The animator {{needs to be}} a skilled artist and has to understand the basics of three-dimensional shapes, anatomy, weight, balance, light and shadow, etc. For the classical animator, this involved taking art classes and doing sketches from life. One thing in particular that Johnston and Thomas warned against was creating [...] "twins": characters whose left and right sides mirrored each other, and looked lifeless. Modern-day computer animators draw less because of the facilities computers give them, yet their work benefits greatly from a basic understanding of animation principles, and their additions to basic computer animation.|$|E

2500|$|Sukkot (סוכות or סֻכּוֹת, sukkōt) or Succoth is {{a seven-day}} festival, {{also known as}} the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (shalosh regalim) {{mentioned}} in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert {{on their way to the}} Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word sukkot is the plural of the Hebrew word sukkah, meaning booth. Jews are commanded to [...] "dwell" [...] in booths during the holiday. This generally <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> meals, but some sleep in the sukkah as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific rules for constructing a sukkah.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas both Marxist–Leninist {{and social}} {{democratic}} orthodox thinkers viewed Marxism {{as a new}} kind of positive science, Frankfurt School theorists such as Horkheimer instead based their work on the epistemological base of Marx's work, which presented itself as critique, as in Marx's [...] They thus emphasized that Marx attempted to create {{a new kind of}} critical analysis oriented toward the unity of theory and revolutionary practice rather than a new kind of positive science. Critique, in this Marxian sense, <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> the ideology of a society (for example, the belief in individual freedom or free market capitalism) and critiquing it by comparing it with a posited social reality of that very society (for example, social inequality and exploitation). Frankfurt School theorists grounded this on the dialectical methodology established by Hegel and Marx.|$|E
2500|$|Immigration – The {{issue of}} {{immigration}} in France has split France. The number of deportations {{more than doubled}} since 2002, with Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior from 2002 to 2004 and 2005 to 2007. Sarkozy declared in April 2006 that immigrants who did not [...] "like France" [...] should [...] "leave it." [...] Opponents have labelled Sarkozy's attitude as repressive, in particular towards illegal immigrants, materialised by numerous police raids against illegal aliens, strongly opposed by the left. The main problem concerns illegal immigrants (sans-papiers, [...] "without documents") who cannot obtain work permits without proper immigration documents and are therefore mostly found in the informal economy – construction, restaurants, etc. Although the right of foreigners to vote was a classic claim of the left-wing, {{it has not been}} an important issue of the campaign. On the other hand, Sarkozy has declared himself in favour of affirmative action which has been widely contested both on the left and on the right, on grounds that it would favour communautarisme – separation of communities – along ethnic lines, and that it <b>means</b> <b>taking</b> into account ethnic alleged memberships in statistics, which is legally prohibited and not done by the INSEE. Left-wingers argued in favour of social actions not based on ethnic factors, but on geographical situation and equality of territory; however, the traditional Universalism of the French Republicans has also been criticised on the left-wing by some intellectuals supporting a middle-ground between Republican universalism and multiculturalism.|$|E
