2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a <b>modulated</b> <b>groove</b> into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison {{describes}} as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the diaphragm of the recording horn to the mastering lathe, typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a <b>modulated</b> <b>groove</b> into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc. These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from wax; this gave rise to the colloquial term waxing, referring to the cutting of a record.|$|E
50|$|Inventor Thomas Edison, {{who always}} favored the {{cylinder}} {{for all its}} advantages, also cut his discs with vertically <b>modulated</b> <b>grooves</b> from their introduction in 1912 until {{a year or two}} before his company's demise in 1929 (Edison Disc Records). Edison pioneered fine groove discs that played for up to five minutes per 10-inch side; they were very thick to remain perfectly flat and played back with a precision-ground diamond stylus. A commercially unsuccessful extension of the system introduced grooves nearly twice as fine as those of microgroove LPs, yielding playing times of up to 20 minutes per side at 80 RPM and again requiring a special diamond stylus. Even more than with Pathé discs, Edison's vertical-cut records called for specially designed equipment for playback.|$|R
2500|$|A {{phonograph}} record (also {{known as a}} gramophone [...] record (especially in British English), vinyl record, or simply vinyl or record), is an analog sound storage medium {{in the form of}} a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed, <b>modulated</b> spiral <b>groove.</b> The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc.|$|R
25|$|The phonograph, {{record player}} or {{gramophone}} is {{an instrument for}} recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played. Later, the gramophone record with <b>modulated</b> spiral <b>grooves</b> set atop a rotating turntable. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. On February 8, 1878, Edison was issued the first patent (U.S. patent #200,521) for the phonograph.|$|R
5000|$|Scratching: Although the {{invention}} of record scratching {{as a form of}} adding to the musical entertainment is generally credited to Grand Wizzard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash perfected the technique and brought it to new audiences. Scratching, along with punch phrasing, exhibited a unique performative aspect of party DJing: instead of passively spinning records, he manipulated them to create new music. Scratching, more commonly known among radio broadcasters as back-cueing, was devised in the late 1940s as a way to find {{the very beginning of the}} audio in the <b>modulated</b> <b>groove</b> of a vinyl record. It is related to scrubbing (in terms of audio editing and production) when the reels of an open reel tape deck (typically 1/4 inch magnetic audio tape) are gently rotated back and forth while the playback head is live and amplified, in order to isolate a specific spot on the tape where an editing cut is to be made.|$|E
50|$|In {{the era of}} {{acoustical}} recordings (prior to {{the introduction}} of microphones, electrical recording and amplification), the earliest recording studios were very basic facilities, being essentially soundproof rooms that isolated the performers from outside noise. During this era it was not uncommon for recordings to be made in any available location, such as a local ballroom, using portable acoustic recording equipment. In this period, master recordings were made using a direct-to-disc cutting process. Performers were typically grouped around a large acoustic horn (an enlarged version of the familiar phonograph horn). The acoustic energy from the voices and/or instruments was channeled through the horn's diaphragm to a mechanical cutting lathe located in the next room, which inscribed the signal as a <b>modulated</b> <b>groove</b> directly onto the surface of the master cylinder or disc. Following the invention and commercial introduction of the microphone, the electronic amplifier, the mixing desk and the loudspeaker, the recording industry gradually converted to electric recording, and by 1925 this technology had replaced mechanical acoustic recording methods for such major labels as RCA Victor and Columbia, and by 1933 acoustic recording was completely disused.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the early}} 1950s, when radio {{networks}} and local stations wanted {{to preserve a}} live broadcast, they did so by means of special phonograph records known as [...] "electrical transcriptions" [...] (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor {{or one of the}} performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12 inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 rpm, which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, commonly known as acetates and recorded at a speed of 33 rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a [...] "hill and dale" [...] vertically <b>modulated</b> <b>groove,</b> rather than the [...] "lateral" [...] side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen minutes on each side, allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.|$|E

40|$|Possible stereochemical {{determinants}} of {{the orientation of}} TBP on the TATA box are discussed using the crystal coordinates of TBP-TATA complexes, which have been determined by other groups. The C-terminal half of the TBP beta-sheet interacts with the TATA site of the DNA, and the N-terminal half with the A-rich site, so that the two sites with distinct curvatures produce a unique fit. Although chemical contacts take place between {{one side of the}} beta-sheet and the DNA minor groove, the interaction seems to be facilitated indirectly by the characteristics of {{the other side of the}} beta-sheet and the DNA major groove. Thus, Ala 71, Leu 162 and Pro 190 differentiate the curvature of the beta-sheet in the N- and C-halves. The methyl positions in the DNA major <b>groove</b> <b>modulate</b> the bendability of the two DNA sites by using differences in the rolling capacity of TA and AT compared with PyT, and in the shifting capacity of AT compared with TT. The deformations of the first steps (TA and PyT) in the two sites are the largest and thus are important for the overall bending of the DNA. The differences between the two DNA sites are greatest at the second steps (AT and TT) and so these are important for determining the orientation of TBP...|$|R

40|$|Topographic cues {{have been}} {{recognized}} crucial on the modulation of cell behavior, and subsequent important {{for the design of}} implants, cell-based biomedical devices and tissue-engineered products. Grooved topography direct cells to align anisotropically on the substrates, resulting in an obvious morphological difference compared with the flat and the other topographies. This study aimed at investigating the effects of grooved topography on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts, adipocytes and myoblasts. A series of submicron-grooved polystyrene substrates with equal groove-to-ridge ratio but different width and depth (width/depth (nm) : 450 / 100, 450 / 350, 900 / 100, and 900 / 550) were fabricated based on electron beam lithography and soft lithography techniques. Primary rat MSCs (rMSCs) were cultured on these substrates without induction for differentiation for 6 days, and then subjected to induction for osteogenesis, adipogenesis and myogenesis. While the alignment of rMSCs strongly complied with the direction of the grooves and increased with groove depths, cell attachment on day 1 (similar to 1. 5 x 10 (4) /cm(2)) and cell proliferation after 6 days of culture (similar to 5 x 10 (4) /cm(2)) were not significantly affected by substrate types. Osteogenesis, indicated by alkaline phosphatase activities and calcium deposit, was not significantly <b>modulated</b> by the <b>grooved</b> substrates, compared with the flat control, suggesting that cell alignment may not determine osteoinduction of rMSCs. On the other hand, adipogenesis, indicated by lipid production, was significantly enhanced by the grooved substrates compared with the flat surface (P < 0. 001). On the other hand, myogenesis, indicated by desmin and MHC staining, was enhanced by the grooves in a time- and groove size-dependent manner compared with the flat control. The results suggested that grooved topography has an in-depth potential for modulating the commitment of the stem cell lineages, which could benefit the development of advanced biomaterials for biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{various aspects}} of optical disk data storage systems {{from the point of}} view of the irradiance and phase distributions at the exit pupil of the objective lens. The research topics were chosen in order to address some of the problems facing future generations of optical disk systems. Future optical disks will have a much greater areal data density, and will undoubtedly use a shorter wavelength in order to decrease the size of the optical stylus. The research in this dissertation examines some of the problems inherent in the move to shorter wavelengths. For example, at short wavelengths, the tolerance on acceptable disk tilt becomes tighter; disks must either be manufactured with a tighter flatness tolerance, or a system must be devised such that the problems caused by disk tilt are corrected inside the optical disk drive. (Such a system is described in Chapter 6.) The other topics in this dissertation address similar problems, all of which are essential for a more complete understanding of optical disk technology. After a brief introduction to the irradiance distribution at the exit pupil of the objective lens (typically called the baseball pattern), we describe a novel focusing/tracking technique. Many optical disk drives use the astigmatic technique, in which the baseball pattern is projected onto an astigmatic lens that focuses the beam onto a quadrant detector placed between the two line foci of the lens. We experimentally demonstrate that by projecting the baseball pattern onto a ring lens (i. e. a lens that focuses light to a ring rather than a single spot), we are able to produce steeper focus-error signals that are more resistant to feed-through (induced on the focus-error signal by track crossings during the seek operation) than the astigmatic technique. We then examine the effects of substrate birefringence and tilt on the irradiance and phase distributions at the exit pupil of the objective lens. The irradiance and phase patterns are calculated and experimentally verified for the cases of no substrate birefringence, birefringence aligned with the incident polarization, and birefringence aligned at 45 ° to the incident polarization. The irradiance at the exit pupil is also calculated and experimentally verified for a grooved substrate for various amounts of substrate tilt. We then examine two distinct effects that are dependent on the incident polarization direction. The first of these is the excitation of surface plasmons at the interface between the dielectric substrate (or air, if the optical disk's storage layer is air-incident) and the metallic thin films in the disk. These plasmons are responsible for dips in the zeroth order diffraction efficiency curves of a metal grating at certain angles of incidence. The dips appear as dark bands in the baseball pattern and are seen only when there is a component of incident polarization that lies perpendicular to the tracks. The location of these bands is derived from theoretical considerations and is shown to depend on the track pitch and the materials involved, but not on the groove depth or width. The band locations are confirmed by zeroth order diffraction efficiency measurements as a function of incident angle. A possible negative effect of these bands is the introduction of additional fluctuations and noise into the focusing and push-pull tracking signals. The second of the polarization-dependent effects concerns the differences in tracking performance with respect to the direction of the incident-light polarization. In optical disk storage systems, the signal that provides tracking information is dependent on the groove shape, the optical constants of the materials involved, and the polarization state of the incident light. We show that the tracking signals can be described by two measurable quantities, both of which are largely independent of aberrations in the optical system. Using these two quantities, we match the tracking performance of a given optical disk to an equivalent disk having rectangular grooves - the adjustable parameters being the rectangular groove depth and the duty cycle. By assumption, the rectangular <b>grooves</b> <b>modulate</b> only the phase of the incident beam and disregard its state of polarization. The effective groove depth and the duty cycle thus become dependent on the polarization state of the incident beam. We examine the dependencies for various disks having different groove geometries and different combinations of materials. Next, we use the baseball pattern as a diagnostic tool to develop and demonstrate the concepts of a servo system for the correction of disk tilt. Since disk tilt produces primarily coma in the beam focused onto the disk, the system uses a "variable coma generator" to produce and equal and opposite amount of coma as that caused by the tilted disk. The magnitude and direction of disk tilt are detected using the light reflected from the front facet of the disk substrate. Finally, we address a major obstacle in the construction of future generation optical disk testers - the use of shorter wavelengths and thinner substrates. A typical aspheric singlet used as the objective lens in optical disk data storage systems will not work at different wavelengths or with different substrate thicknesses, due to spherochromatism. Using two microscope objectives with adjustable collars and a pair of relay lenses, we have constructed a system in which a diffraction-limited spot of any wavelength in the range of 0. 4 μm - 0. 7 μm can be moved by as much as ± 1 00 μm in both the focusing and tracking directions. This is accomplished by simply moving an aspheric singlet mounted in an off-the-shelf optical head. The system uses the adjustable collars of the microscope objectives to correct for the spherochromatism of the singlet, and to accommodate the various thicknesses of the substrates...|$|R
