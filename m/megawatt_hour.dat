2500|$|Wood burning {{creates more}} {{atmospheric}} CO2 than biodegradation of wood {{in a forest}} (in a given period of time) because {{by the time the}} bark of a dead tree has rotted, the log has already been occupied by other plants and micro-organisms which continue to sequester the CO2 by integrating the hydrocarbons of the wood into their own life cycle.
