40|$|Two {{prototype}} ballasted electrodes were fabricated {{and tested}} with a large-volume, reduced pressure, pulsed CO 2 laser gas discharge, initiated by corona pre-ionization, and pumped by pulse widths up to 19 mu s. The design of segmented, ballasted cathodes is considered and equations are derived {{to quantify the}} degree of discharge arcing given partial collapse of the discharge. The number of segments passing the fault current was experimentally investigated {{as a function of}} the discharge power and found to increase until each segment passed the fault current. Compared with a planar-planar electrode geometry, under identical pulse excitation conditions, the ballast electrodes gave a factor of four improvement in the maximum discharge power depositions, prior to the development of instabilities. Higher frequencies were obtained with pulse trains below 50 ms, the <b>maximum</b> <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> being approximately 5 kHz. Arcing for the ballasted electrode configurations was observed in the middle of the electrodes, and its position corresponded to a measured non-uniform gas velocity...|$|E
30|$|The {{electron}} density from the IRI {{is not expected}} to be accurate for the ionosphere under the poleward-expanding substorm auroral arc which is the source the MFB. It may better represent density profiles in the quiet polar cap poleward of the arc, through which the MFB rays propagate to reach Toolik Lake. Interestingly, in this case the distinct lower cutoff of the MFB near 1.5  MHz corresponds approximately to the maximum value of the L-cutoff frequency in the ionosphere (f_L,), and the <b>maximum</b> <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> of MFB corresponds approximately to the maximum value of the plasma frequency in the ionosphere (f_pe,). If this is true, the bulk of the MFB at 1.5 – 2.0  MHz conforms to predictions of the topside generation mechanism proposed by LaBelle (2011), in which MFB originates as Langmuir waves generated over a range of altitudes at frequencies up to f=f_pe, and reaching the ground under the condition that f>f_L,. Broughton et al. (2012) showed {{that a large number of}} MFB events observed at Sondrestrom, Greenland, obeyed this relationship.|$|E
40|$|Kilometric {{continuum}} (KC) is {{the high}} frequency component (approximately 100 kHz to approximately 800 kHz) of nonthermal continuum (NTC). Unlike the lower frequency portion of NTC (approximately 5 kHz to approximately 100 kHz) whose source is around the dawn sector, the source of KC occurs at all magnetic local times. The latitudinal beaming of KC as observed by GEOTAIL is, for most events, restricted to plus or minus 15 degrees magnetic latitude. KC has been observed during periods of both low and strong geomagnetic activity, with no significant correlation of wave intensity with K(sub p), index. However statistically the <b>maximum</b> <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> of KC emission tends to increase with K(sub p) index, the effect is more pronounced around solar maximum, but is also detected near solar minimum. There is strong evidence that the source region of KC is from the equatorial plasmapause during periods when {{a portion of the}} plasmapause moves significantly inwards from its nominal position. Case studies have shown that KC emissions are nearly always associated with plasmaspheric notches, shoulders, and tails. There is a recent focus on trying to understand the banded frequency structure of this emission and its relationship to plasmaspheric density ducts and irregularities in the source region...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} susceptibility of the optimally doped Pr$_{ 1 -x}$LaCe$_x$CuO$_ 4 $ in the superconducting state is calculated using the t-J model of Cu-O planes, Mori's projection operator technique and the dispersion of electron bands derived from photoemission experiments. The electron band folding across the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone border, which {{is inherent in}} the crystal, leads to a commensurate low-frequency response. The same band folding causes the appearance of a supplementary spin-excitation branch. The coexistence of the two spin-excitation branches explains two <b>maxima</b> <b>observed</b> in the <b>frequency</b> dependence of the susceptibility. The calculated momentum and frequency dependencies are close to experimental observations. Similarities and differences in the magnetic responses of electron- and hole-doped cuprates are discussed.

40|$|Special {{relativity}} {{asserts that}} physical phenomena appear {{the same for}} all inertially moving observers. This symmetry, called Lorentz symmetry, relates long wavelengths to short ones: if the symmetry is exact it implies that spacetime must look the same at all length scales. Several approaches to quantum gravity, however, suggest {{that there may be a}} Lorentz violating microscopic structure of spacetime, for example discreteness, non-commutativity, or extra dimensions. Here we determine a very strong constraint on a type of Lorentz violation that produces a maximum electron speed less than the speed of light. We use the observation of 100 MeV synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula to improve the previous limits by a factor of 40 million, ruling out this type of Lorentz violation, and thereby providing an important constraint on theories of quantum gravity.

40|$|To {{determine}} if {{the source of the}} Jovian Io-dependent DAM (decametric) emission is along the instantaneous Io flux tube (IIFT), the results of ray-tracing calculations are compared with radio emission data obtained by the Planetary Radio Astronomy instruments on Voyager 1 and 2. RX mode gyroemission at frequencies near the local gyrofrequency and sources along field lines within the active sector between 150 and 270 deg longitude are assumed. The results indicate good agreement with the observations if the source is within 20 deg of the IIFT, but the maximum gyrofrequency of the model magnetic field is smaller than the <b>observed</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> of the DAM for the assumed active field line. While errors in the magnetic-field model coupled with emission at large Doppler shift might explain this discrepancy, a more natural explanation is that the higher-frequency component of the DAM is due to second-harmonic gyroemission...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} coherent driving of {{a single}} electron spin using second harmonic excitation in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. Our estimates suggest that the anharmonic dot confining potential combined with a gradient in the transverse magnetic field dominates the second harmonic response. As expected, the Rabi frequency depends quadratically on the driving amplitude and the periodicity {{with respect to the}} phase of the drive is twice that of the fundamental harmonic. The <b>maximum</b> Rabi <b>frequency</b> <b>observed</b> for the second harmonic is just a factor of two lower than that achieved for the first harmonic when driving at the same power. Combined with the lower demands on microwave circuitry when operating at half the qubit frequency, these observations indicate that second harmonic driving can be a useful technique for future quantum computation architectures.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} whether {{it is possible to}} determine a critical sampling grid density for a given ore body, above which further improvement in the accuracy of the estimated ore reserves would be small or negligible. The methodology employed is based on the theory of information. First, it is proven that the range of influence, when appears in the variogram function, {{is a measure of the}} <b>maximum</b> variability <b>frequency</b> <b>observed</b> in the ore body. Then, a simple application of the well-known sampling theorem shows that, under certain assumptions, it is possible to define a critical sampling density as mentioned before.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{responses}} to odor stimulation of 40 single {{units in the}} olfactory mucosa and of 18 units in the olfactory bulb of the tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) were recorded with indium-filled, Pt-black-tipped microelectrodes. The test battery consisted of 27 odorants which were proved effective by recording from small bundles of olfactory nerve. Two concentrations of each odorant were employed. These values were adjusted for response magnitudes equal to those for amyl acetate at- 2. 5 and- 3. 5 log concentration in olfactory twig recording. Varying concentrations were generated by an injection-type olfactometer. The mucosal responses were exclusively facilitory with a peak frequency of 16 impulses/sec. 19 mucosal units responded {{to at least one}} odorant and each unit was sensitive to a limited number of odorants (1 - 15). The sensitivity pattern of each unit was highly individual, with no clear-cut types, either chemical or qualitative, emerging. Of the 18 olfactory bulb units sampled, all responded to at least one odorant. The <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>observed</b> during a response was 39 impulses/sec. The bulbar neurons can be classified into two types. There are neurons that respond exclusively with facilitation and others that respond with facilitation to some odorants and with inhibition to others.

40|$|The {{maturity}} of the undulate ray, Raja undulata, {{one of the}} most important by-catch elasmobranch species captured in south Portugal, was studied for the first time. Females ranged in total length (TL) from 19. 4 to 88. 2 cm and males from 23. 0 to 83. 2 cm. The gonadosomatic index for females was higher during the winter, meaning that this species reproduces during this season. Females matured at significantly larger sizes and older ages than males, with 50 % of the females mature at 76. 2 cm TL at an age of 8. 98 years while 50 % maturity for males was achieved at 73. 6 cm TL and 7. 66 years.
