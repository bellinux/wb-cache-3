40|$|We report 40 {{cases of}} {{homozygous}} beta thalassaemia, aged between 3 and 24 months, who were observed between January 1990 and June 1996 at the Thalassaemia Centre, Paediatric Department, Catania University. A questionnaire {{was used to}} find out the parents' knowledge of their risk before the birth of the affected children and showed that the persistence of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>anaemia</b> in Sicily was mainly because of the following reasons: (1) poor information (62. 5 %), (2) laboratory error (12. 5 %), (3) difficulty in the differential diagnosis of beta thalassaemia trait (10 %), and (4) not performing prenatal testing or selective abortion of an affected fetus (15 %). We conclude that improved preventive measures at various medical and social levels can remove risk factors and so further reduce the incidence of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>anaemia</b> in Sicily...|$|E
40|$|Since 1975 the Rome Microcythaemia Centre {{has carried}} out every year, {{under the auspices}} of the health {{authorities}} of the Latium region, a screening of thalassaemics among intermediate schoolchildren of Latium. From these campaigns, knowledge about thalassaemias among the young adult population has grown which, in its turn, has resulted in screening of these young adults. Through screening in schools between 1975 and 1982, of 289 763 students examined, 6838 thalassaemics were identified, 6045 of whom were beta- or delta beta-thalassaemics. The total number of young thalassaemics who are identified at present in the Centre through screenings of schoolchildren and young adults is about 3300 per year. Furthermore, from January 1980 to April 1983, 110 prospective couples of child-bearing age at risk (94 of whom originated from Latium) were identified at the Centre, and five homozygous fetuses (three of which originated from Latium) were diagnosed. These data derive from an area in which the frequency of thalassaemia is only 2. 4 %, and they show that the programme in Latium for the prevention of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>anaemia</b> has been successful...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Pattern {{recognition}} is the research area of Artificial Intelligence that studies {{the operation and}} design of systems that recognize patterns in the data. Important application areas are image analysis, character recognition, fingerprint classification, speech analysis, DNA sequence identification, man and machine diagnostics, person identification and industrial inspection. The interest in improving the classification systems of data analysis is independent from the context of applications. In fact, in many studies it {{is often the case}} to have to recognize and to distinguish groups of various objects, which requires the need for valid instruments capable to perform this task. The objective {{of this article is to}} show several methodologies of Artificial Intelligence for data classification applied to biomedical patterns. In particular, this work deals with the realization of a Computer-Aided Detection system (CADe) that is able to assist the radiologist in identifying types of mammary tumor lesions. As an additional biomedical application of the classification systems, we present a study conducted on blood samples which shows how these methods may help to distinguish between carriers of Thalassemia (or <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Anaemia)</b> and healthy subjects. Keywords—Computer Aided Detection, mammary tumor, pattern recognition, dissimilarit...|$|E
40|$|Updated {{results of}} the thalassaemia {{prevention}} programme carried out in Latium Previous results of our programme {{have been published in}} this Journal. 1 - 3 Its basic concept is that both the distribution of information about the prevention of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>anaemia</b> (thalassaemia) and the mass screening for thalas-saemia carriers must be carried out much earlier than adulthood and must not be exclusively aimed at pregnant women or already established couples. Early timing of the preventive actions now available provides thalassaemia carriers with a number of options for prevention (including the choice of a non-thalassaemia carrier partner) besides making the option of selective abortion earlier, easier, and more widely adopted. Based on these grounds, the preventive programme carried out in Latium from 1975 by the Centro di Studi della Microcitemia di Roma, supported by Regional Health Authorities of Latium, consists of the following. (1) Distribution of information throughout the population of reproductive age, starting with teenagers who can be most conveniently contacted at secondary schools. After this first stage, the most practical and successful methods have proved to be: meetings of the Family Health Services; delivery of pamphlets and other explanatory material to people shortly to be married in the General Registry Office; periodic requests to all Public Health Officers in order to make them secondary sources of the relevant information; and the repeated use of the mass media. (2) Mass screening of two types: annual screening of final year students in secondary schools, and continuous screening of school leavers, who come on their own initiative to be examined at the Centre. The number o...|$|E
