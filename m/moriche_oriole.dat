5000|$|<b>Moriche</b> <b>oriole,</b> Icterus cayanensis chrysocephalus - {{recently}} {{merged into}} I. cayanensis ...|$|E
50|$|The {{song of the}} <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole</b> is a squeaky {{whistling}} heaaa-wheeooo-heaaa. This is an often-conspicuous species {{near its}} favoured tree, and usually occurs singly or in pairs.|$|E
50|$|This tree is {{important}} to many animal species; several bird species, such as the red-bellied macaw, sulphury flycatcher, and <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole,</b> use it for nesting and food. Tapirs, peccaries, fish and monkeys depend on the fruit.|$|E
50|$|The {{epaulet oriole}} (Icterus cayanensis) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Icteridae. The <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole,</b> {{formerly}} considered a distinct species (I. chrysocephalus) is now placed herein as a subspecies. The variable oriole, (I. pyrrhopterus), was formerly considered conspecific, but has recently been split by the SACC.|$|E
50|$|This ecologically {{distinct}} {{bird was}} formerly {{treated as a}} species Icterus chrysocephalus. It was eventually found to be embedded in the epaulet oriole (I. cayanensis) clade. Thus, for example the AOU since 2005 has lumped the <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole</b> into I. cayanensis. The subspecific structure of I. cayanensis is still rather puzzling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole</b> (Icterus cayanensis chrysocephalus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} New World family Icteridae. It is {{unrelated to}} Old World orioles (family Oriolidae). It is a breeding resident in the tropics of eastern South America. This bird is noted for its close association with the palm Mauritia flexuosa (moriche, buriti, ita, it√©, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The <b>moriche</b> <b>oriole</b> is a bird closely {{associated}} with moriche palms (Mauritia flexuosa), and it {{is found in the}} forests, swamps or savannah where that tree occurs. This bird eats mainly insects, but will also take nectar and some fruit. Its nest is a long hanging basket of grass and other plant fibres, suspended from the end of a moriche palm branch. The normal clutch is two dark-spotted pale blue or white eggs.|$|E
