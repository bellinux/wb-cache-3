5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses <b>masquerade</b> points, although additional <b>masquerade</b> points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the <b>masquerade</b> five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like <b>masquerade</b> points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Vampire: The <b>Masquerade</b> – Bloodlines began at Troika Games in November 2001.

Instead of developing a sequel to Redemption, the development team researched the White Wolf property, including the game's rules and its storylines. Troika was a small game studio, with five developers and a total staff of thirty-two (including lead writer Brian Mitsoda, who joined the team {{less than a year}} after development began). Although some preliminary design and levels were completed, much of the work was abandoned or redeveloped.|$|E
