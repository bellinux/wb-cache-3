500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the family moved}} to another {{tenement}} block, this time in Scotstoun, and Wark's father secured employment at nearby Albion Motors. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said [...] "ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a youngster" [...] as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at St Mirren. Wark attended Scotstoun Primary School, where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team. [...] He also played for Drumchapel Amateurs at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by David Moyes' father, also named David.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Test arena, Willis played 64 One Day International matches for his country, taking 80 wickets, and was a prolific List-A (one day) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20.18. With the bat, Willis made little impression as a tail-ender with a best Test score of 28 not-out (*); however, he managed two half-centuries at first-class level {{and for a time}} held a record number of Test not-outs. Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984. Under Willis' captaincy England won seven, lost five and drew six Tests, and won 16 of the ODIs. Botham recalled Willis as [...] "a tremendous trier.. a great team-man and an inspiration", as well as the [...] "only world-class fast bowler in <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> an England player." [...] The editor of Wisden wrote of him in similar terms: [...] "His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets. Although often beset with aches and pains, he never spared himself when bowling for his country." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} West Brom debut in a 4–0 home defeat to Manchester City on 10 March 1956. In 1957–58, {{he was the}} club's top league goalscorer; his tally of 24 goals {{included}} four in a 5–1 win against Burnley. Often playing as a midfielder, {{he went on to}} play 257 matches and score 61 goals for West Brom, and he captained the team for the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons. However, in August 1962, he returned to Fulham after a disagreement with West Brom vice-chairman Jim Gaunt over his salary. The ongoing dispute over both minimum and maximum wages in the game, instigated by Robson's teammate Jimmy Hill and the Professional Footballers' Association, combined with the birth of Robson's second son, prompted Robson to demand a higher salary. Gaunt refused to negotiate Robson's contract, so Robson placed a transfer request and was sold to Fulham for £20,000 in a deal which doubled his salary. Soon after Robson joined Fulham, the club sold Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh, meaning Robson's chances of securing any significant honour there were substantially reduced. Robson himself stated, [...] "In all <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a footballer, I didn't win a thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company {{fell in love with the}} idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." [...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." [...] Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying [...] "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was. I am afraid I cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success." ...|$|E

My going away to the city {{at the very moment}} when my presence was most necessary seemed base desertion. While she had been suffering, longing and lonely, I had been feasting.

2500|$|Thorpe {{announced}} his retirement from Test cricket after the England selectors chose Kevin Pietersen instead of {{him for the first}} Test of The Ashes in July 2005.

2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the United States became engaged in a series of local {{conflicts}} in Latin America, which went into history as banana wars.

So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, and I listened to the playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like.
