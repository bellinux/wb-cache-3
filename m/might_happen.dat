5|$|Rowling {{has said}} it is {{unlikely}} she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series. In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely {{to be in the}} fantasy genre. On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga <b>might</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E
5|$|Lark {{received}} missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and {{constituted the}} leadership of Milorg in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter, and he soon {{became one of the}} most important persons in {{the leadership of}} Milorg. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943. Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to them if he went through with the assassination. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943, and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in psychological warfare.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

50|$|When {{nothing was}} heard from Lenz {{throughout}} the summer, his family started {{to worry that}} something <b>might</b> have <b>happened.</b> The Ottoman Empire was at this time going {{through a period of}} turmoil, the ongoing Hamidian Massacres were killing tens of thousands of Armenians. It was difficult to ascertain what <b>might</b> have <b>happened,</b> but Alexander Terrell, the U.S. minister to Turkey, felt sure that Lenz had been killed by Kurdish bandits.|$|R
25|$|He criticized Scioli for {{negative}} campaigning by the Front for Victory. Several politicians and FPV institutions issued warnings about what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if Macri were elected president. According to Scioli, {{the campaign was}} intended to encourage public awareness. It was rumored that the campaign might have been suggested by Brazilian João Santana, who organized a similar campaign in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.|$|E
25|$|Event horizon: An {{awareness}} of plans and events {{in time and}} space. It includes an {{awareness of}} what has happened (useful for diagnosis, to achieve SA, to frame situations). It also includes prognosis, an awareness of what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> next.

25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what <b>might</b> <b>happen,</b> since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.|$|E
25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, {{know anything about the}} genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|A {{prolific}} and adaptable species, {{the eastern}} gray squirrel {{has been introduced}} to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States. The gray squirrel is an invasive species in Britain; it has spread {{across the country and}} has largely displaced the native red squirrel, S. vulgaris. In Ireland, the red squirrel has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country. That such displacement <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> in Italy is of concern, and gray squirrels might spread from Italy to other parts of mainland Europe.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{extremely}} rare p-p IV branch. Other even-rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or {{because the number of}} reacting particles is so low that any reactions that <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> are statistically insignificant. This is partly why no mass-5 or mass-8 elements are seen. While the reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei coming together to form beryllium-8, may actually happen, these elements are not detected because there are no stable isotopes of atomic masses 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.|$|E
