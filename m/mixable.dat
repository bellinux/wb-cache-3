50|$|Royal Talens {{also has}} {{produced}} a water <b>mixable</b> painting paste {{that acts as a}} thickener as well as transparetizer which will not change the consistency of the paint. There are many documented issues with accelerator products in this category causing cracking and damaging the archivability of the medium.|$|E

50|$|There was a brick making industry, in Farmville, {{using the}} clay of the Farmville Basin. In 1874, M.R. Murkland built a kiln for his hand-formed bricks. He made around 600,000 bricks each year. The Triassic Clay of the Farmville Basin was <b>mixable</b> and plastic enough {{and would not}} shrink too much which made it {{suitable}} for bricks.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the remixes {{featured}} on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a <b>mixable</b> intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged, digital, multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services {{have focused on}} a specific style of music (such as hip-hop or rock) or type of remix (such as house mixes of pop hits).|$|E
5000|$|The SH-3A is a {{monophonic}} {{analog synthesizer}} that was manufactured by Roland from 1974 to 1981. It {{is unique in}} that it is capable of both subtractive synthesis and additive synthesis. Two LFOs and a unique sample-and-hold section provided capabilities not found in competing self-contained synthesizers of the time. The SH-3A was Roland's first non-preset based synth. It was unique for its time in that it offered <b>mixable</b> waveforms at different footages. The predecessor, the Roland SH-1000 could also do this but didn't offer as much control as on the SH-3A. The rhythmic pulsing in the Blondie song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] is an example of its sound.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{receiving}} invitations {{for live}} performances, Raimondi and Ugolini {{decided to use}} models for Fun Fun's public image rather than the vocalists themselves, a common tactic used in the European dance music scene by artists like Baltimora and The Real McCoy. Have Fun!, the band's first full album from 1984, featured Francesca Merola and Roberta Servelli as the on-stage faces for the group. Have Fun! featured other popular dance singles, including [...] "Give Me Your Love," [...] "Living In Japan" [...] and the band's oft-covered signature hit [...] "Colour My Love", which became popular in American nightclubs because of its insistent synth bassline and easily <b>mixable</b> percussion intro.|$|E
5000|$|This {{system is}} still popular among {{contemporary}} painters, {{as it is}} basically a simplified version of Newton's geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. However, with the range of contemporary paints available, many artists simply add more paints to their palette as desired {{for a variety of}} practical reasons. For example, they may add a scarlet, purple and/or green paint to expand the <b>mixable</b> gamut; and they include one or more dark colors (especially [...] "earth" [...] colors such as yellow ochre or burnt sienna) simply because they are convenient to have premixed. Printers commonly augment a CMYK palette with spot (trademark specific) ink colors.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} Minimoog innovation {{was a pair}} of wheel controllers {{that the}} musician could use to bend pitch and control modulation effects in real time. The two wheels are mounted {{to the left of the}} keyboard, next to the lowest key. The function of the Pitch wheel was assigned solely to control oscillator pitch (either sharp or flat from a default, detented, non spring-loaded center position), whereas its neighboring Mod (Modulation) wheel was assignable to control a <b>mixable</b> amount of oscillator 3 and/or Noise routed to the three oscillators and/or the VCF cutoff frequency. In particular, the intuitive function and feel of the Pitch wheel allowed Minimoog users to create similar expressive pitch-bending effects that musicians such as guitarists achieve by physically 'bending' strings and using [...] "whammy" [...] bars.|$|E
50|$|From 1974-76 RMI {{produced}} {{its only}} true synthesizer, the $3,000 RMI Harmonic Synthesizer, {{an instrument that}} was years {{ahead of its time}} (Yamaha's DX-7 was released in 1983, nine years later) but not widely used or understood. The 48-key dual mono, analog/digital hybrid synth featured two digital harmonic generators (16 harmonics each, with two sets of harmonic sliders), five presets, an LFO, arpeggiator, a VCF with <b>mixable</b> LP,BP and HP outputs, and AM and FM capability. It was used most prominently by Jean Michel Jarre who played the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer on his Oxygène (1976) album as well as on many other albums that were to follow later. Stevie Wonder and Isaac Hayes were also rumoured to have this instrument in their rigs. In more recent times, the Harmonic Synthesizer was used by Richard D. James aka Aphex Twin and Stephen Parsick/'ramp.|$|E
50|$|While {{the direct}} sample loading {{facilities}} {{of the previous}} TS/ASR models were lost, a rare add-on card, called the MR-Flash, allowed the MR/ZR keyboards to load up to 4 mebibytes of samples into permanent flash ROM, via floppy disk drive. However, no sample library import facilities were offered, so existing ASR/TS owners couldn't use their sample files on the new machine. A drum machine with pro-quality <b>mixable</b> preset patterns, benefited from the unusually large internal drum sounds library (approx. 700 samples) and was integrated with the sequencer, {{but it was impossible}} to create patterns inside the machine. Instead, a program that allowed a user to create drum patterns on PC was developed, thus allowing the user to create numerous rhythms that could be loaded onto disk and work within the fluid drum machine and all aspects of the keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|Shah was a {{patriotic}} person, dedicated civil servant and an efficient administrator. [...] "With his quality {{to identify and}} solve problems, democratic attitude and thorough political analysis, many people will remember {{him for a long}} time" [...] writes Prof. Ghanashyam Kandel.Senior journalist Yuvaraj Ghimire points out that [...] "Shah did not only display honesty and spotless nature during his 45 year long career in public positions, he had also become non-controversial despite the change in political system and successfully conducted four elections including parliamentary and local level ones. He was liberal, cooperative and continued academic studies even after retirement from public service." [...] "Shah always tried to forge consensus among the election commissioners while taking key decisions and he had never tried to impose his ideas on others" [...] recalls Prof. Dr. BIrendra Prasad Mishra, who had worked as the Election Commissioner under the tenure of Shah.As a student Shah was talented, a <b>mixable</b> friend, qualified administrator, honest and loving parent of his family members. He had extraordinary wisdom, dedication and hardworking capacity and capacity to analyze things. We all may get inspiration from his life full of dedication, hard work, honesty and high intellectual capacity.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} ring {{theoretical}} structures of <b>mixable</b> shuffle algebras and their associated free commutative Rota-Baxter algebras. For {{this study we}} utilize the connection of the <b>mixable</b> shuffle algebras with the overlapping shuffle algebra of Hazewinkel, quasi-shuffle algebras of Hoffman and quasi-symmetric functions. This connection allows us to apply methods and results on shuffle products and Lyndon words on ordered sets.

40|$|Given K codes, a {{standard}} result from source coding {{tells us how}} to design a single universal code with codelengths within log(K) bits of the best code, on any data sequence. Translated to the online learning setting of prediction with expert advice, this result implies that for logarithmic loss one can guarantee constant regret, which does not grow {{with the number of}} outcomes that need to be predicted. In this setting, it is known for which other losses the same guarantee can be given: these are the losses that are <b>mixable.</b> We show that among the <b>mixable</b> losses, log loss is special: in fact, one may understand the class of <b>mixable</b> losses as those that behave like log loss in an essential way. More specifically, a loss is <b>mixable</b> if and only if the curvature of its Bayes risk is at least as large as the curvature of the Bayes risk for log loss (for which the Bayes risk equals the entropy). 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{existence}} of predictive complexity for the absolute loss game is studied. Predictive complexity is a generalization of Kolmogorov complexity which bounds {{the ability of}} any algorithm to predict elements of a sequence of outcomes. For perfectly <b>mixable</b> loss functions (logarithmic and squared difference are among them) predictive complexity is defined like Kolmogorov complexity to within an additive constant. The absolute loss function is not perfectly <b>mixable,</b> {{and the question of}} existence of the corresponding predictive complexity, which is defined to within an additive constant, is open. We prove {{that in the case of}} the absolute loss game the predictive complexity can be defined to within an additive term O(n), where n is the length of a sequence of outcomes. We prove also that in some restricted settings this bound cannot be improved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the notion of}} {{mixability}} has been developed with applications to optimal transportation, quantitative finance and operations research. An n-tuple of distributions {{is said to be}} jointly <b>mixable</b> if there exist n random variables following these distributions and adding up to a constant, called center, with probability one. When the n distributions are identical, we speak of complete mixability. If each distribution has finite mean, the center is obviously the sum of the means. In this paper, we investigate the set of centers of completely and jointly <b>mixable</b> distributions not having a finite mean. In addition to several results, we show the (possibly counterintuitive) fact that, for each n ≥ 2, there exist n standard Cauchy random variables adding up to a constant C if and only if |C|<n (n- 1) /π. ...|$|E

40|$|We call {{a matrix}} {{completely}} <b>mixable</b> if the entries in its columns can be permuted {{so that all}} row sums are equal. If it is not completely <b>mixable,</b> we want to determine the smallest maximal and largest minimal row sum attainable. These values provide a discrete approximation of of minimum variance problems for discrete distributions, a problem motivated by the question how to estimate the α-quantile of an aggregate random variable with unknown dependence structure given the marginals of the constituent random variables. We relate this problem to the multidimensional bottleneck assignment problem and show that there exists a polynomial 2 -approximation algorithm if the matrix has only 3 columns. In general, deciding complete mixability is NP-complete. In particular the swapping algorithm of Puccetti et al. is not an exact method unless NP⊆ZPP. For a fixed number of columns it remains NP-complete, but there exists a PTAS. The problem can be solved in pseudopolynomial time for a fixed number of rows, and even in polynomial time if all columns furthermore contain entries from the same multiset...|$|E

If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all <b>mixable,</b> we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable in the standard setting and known to be optimal. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} loss functions used in {{the literature}} on probabilistic prediction are the log loss function, the Brier loss function, and the spherical loss function; however, any computable proper loss function can be used for comparison of prediction algorithms. This note shows that the log loss function is most selective in that any prediction algorithm that is optimal for a given data sequence (in the sense of the algorithmic theory of randomness) under the log loss function will be optimal under any computable proper <b>mixable</b> loss function; on the other hand, there is a data sequence and a prediction algorithm that is optimal for that sequence under either of the two other standard loss functions but not under the log loss function.
