40|$|In the 18 th century, both confessional and {{linguistic}} fissures, {{as well as}} differences in cantonal governments dominated the political life of Switzerland. This geographical fractioning developed into a melting pot fed by the cosmopoli¬ tan exchanges in which Milan {{played a significant role}} through the public and individual actions of its citizens. On the basis of the Lombard Enlightenment, writers, politicians or economists give a contrasted vision of Switzerland mixing the descriptions of the Encyclopédie with the politico-social realities {{of the end of the}} Ancien Régime.

6000|$|... {19} This {{abbreviation}} of {{the penalty}} of useless labour is curiously coincident in verbal form {{with a certain}} passage which some of us may remember. It may perhaps be well to preserve beside this paragraph another cutting out of my store-drawer, from the 'Morning Post,' of about a parallel date, Friday, March 10th, 1865:- [...] "The SALONS of Mme. C-, who did the honours with clever imitative grace and elegance, were crowded with princes, dukes, marquises, and counts--in fact, with the same MALE company as one meets at the parties of the Princess Metternich and Madame Drouyn de Lhuys. Some English peers and members of Parliament were present, and appeared to enjoy the animated and dazzlingly improper scene. On the second floor the supper tables were loaded with every delicacy of the season. That your readers may form {{some idea of the}} dainty fare of the Parisian demi-monde, I copy the menu of the supper, which was served to all the guests (about 200) seated at four o'clock. Choice Yquem, Johannisberg, Laffitte, Tokay, and champagne of the finest vintages were served most lavishly throughout the morning. After supper dancing was resumed with increased animation, and the ball terminated with a CHAINE DIABOLIQUE and a CANCAN D'ENFER at seven in the morning. (Morning service--'Ere the fresh lawns appeared, under the opening eyelids of the Morn.-') Here is the menu:- 'Consomme de volaille e la Bagration: 16 hors-d'oeuvres varies. Bouchees e la Talleyrand. Saumons froids, sauce Ravigote. Filets de boeuf en Bellevue, timbales <b>milanaises,</b> chaudfroid de gibier. Dindes truffees. Pates de foies gras, buissons d'ecrevisses, salades venetiennes, gelees blanches aux fruits, gateaux mancini, parisiens et parisiennes. Fromages glaces. Ananas. Dessert.'" ...|$|R
