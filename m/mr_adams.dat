5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams,</b> who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

25|$|The day {{itself can}} not be determined, but {{it is said that}} in April, 1808, Naomi went missing. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams</b> {{gathered}} a search party and followed the horse tracks to now Randleman, North Carolina, where they found Naomi Wise's body in the river. Mrs. Ann Davis, a resident close to the water, confirmed that she had heard a woman screaming the night before. The coroner from Asheboro examined the drowned and battered body of Naomi and found her pregnant.|$|E

Annabel's pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams</b> and that of Annabel's married sister as if he were already a member.|$|E

After, she prepared for the trip home to New York aboard the Erricson line of steamers. With her was an old sailor's chest fastened by strong ropes containing a quilt, pillow, articles of raiment, small amount of food, bottle of water, and Lear Green. Despite her freedom <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Adams</b> was assigned to the deck. Fortunately for Lear, these prescribed rules existed, for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Adams</b> was closer to the chest. About once or twice through the night during silent watches of the night, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Adams</b> would untie the chest ropes around the claustrophobic chest, raise the lid, and give Lear a breath of fresh air while also checking on her welfare.|$|R

Both parties had felt this the evening before, when they met in company; but now that they were alone together, the feeling became still stronger; and when Susan had requested <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams</b> to take a chair, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams</b> had inquired after Miss Susan's health, there ensued a pause, which, the longer it continued, seemed the more difficult to break, and during which Susan's pretty face slowly assumed an expression of the ludicrous, till she was as near laughing as propriety would admit; and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Adams,</b> having looked out at the window, and up at the mantel-piece, and down at the carpet, at last looked at Susan; their eyes met; the effect was electrical; they both smiled, and then laughed outright, after which the whole difficulty of conversation vanished.|$|E
