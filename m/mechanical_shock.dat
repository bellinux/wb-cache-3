However, accelerometers and other sub-elements that convert and transmit vibrations to the recording system must not corrupt the signal. These elements {{are prone to}} defects because of external injuries during flights or maintenance. This paper will deal with a method to tackle problems of loosening and <b>mechanical</b> <b>shocks.</b> The objective is to perform a passive detection of accelerometer failures from the vibrations without knowledge of previous recordings. Experiments of mechanical failures {{have been carried out}} on a shaker to reproduce in flight vibrations, and it appears that the loosening and <b>mechanical</b> <b>shocks</b> introduce asymmetry and random peaks in the temporal vibrations. Loosening was successfully detected but <b>mechanical</b> <b>shocks</b> were much harder to detect as a result of strong dependences in the vibratory environment.

25|$|Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) {{oscillators}} are timing {{devices that}} generate highly stable reference frequencies, which can measure time. These reference frequencies {{may be used}} to sequence electronic systems, manage data transfer, define radio frequencies, and measure elapsed time. The core technologies used in MEMS oscillators have been in development since the mid-1960s, but have only been sufficiently advanced for commercial applications since 2006. MEMS oscillators incorporate MEMS resonators, which are microelectromechanical structures that define stable frequencies. MEMS clock generators are MEMS timing devices with multiple outputs for systems that need more than a single reference frequency. MEMS oscillators are a valid alternative to older, more established quartz crystal oscillators, offering better resilience against vibration and <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock,</b> and reliability with respect to temperature variation.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock</b> stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E

500|$|In January 1951, Ulam {{had another}} idea: to channel the <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock</b> {{of a nuclear}} {{explosion}} so as to compress the fusion fuel. [...] On the recommendation of his wife, Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it. Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft X-rays from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock</b> and suggested ways to enhance this effect. [...] On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations. [...] A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a fissile rod or cylinder {{at the center of}} the fusion fuel. [...] The detonation of this [...] "spark plug" [...] would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction. [...] The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the [...] "Teller–Ulam design".|$|E
500|$|The breakthrough—the {{details of}} which are still classified—was {{apparently}} {{the separation of the}} fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the X-rays produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel (by process known as [...] "radiation implosion") before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock</b> from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that X-rays from the primary would do the job much more symmetrically. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed the opinion that the idea to use the x-rays would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of it right away was because he was already working on the [...] "Greenhouse" [...] tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of [...] x-rays from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrostatic shock or {{hydraulic}} shock {{is a term}} which describes the observation that a penetrating projectile can produce remote wounding and incapacitating effects in living targets through a hydraulic effect in their liquid-filled tissues, in addition to local effects in tissue caused by direct impact. Just as force applied by a pump in a hydraulic circuit is transmitted throughout the circuit because of the near incompressibility of the liquid, so the kinetic energy of a bullet can sometimes send a shock wave through the body, transferring physical shock to tissues whose physiologic function may be disrupted by it (especially in the circulatory or nervous systems). (Other kinds of shock, namely circulatory and psychological, may follow, but <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock</b> is the immediate disruptor.) There is scientific evidence that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are [...] "light and fast" [...] (such as the 9×19mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are [...] "slow and heavy" [...] (such as the [...]45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen in Wichita, the force continued to Scapa Flow, arriving on 4 April 1942. They {{became part of}} the Home Fleet, which was {{commanded by}} Admiral John C.

Accompanied by various ships, including the UK battleship King George V, carrier , cruiser , and six destroyers, and the US Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers, Washington was assigned to provide distant cover for PQ-15, one of the Iceland–Murmansk convoys. It {{was the first time that}} American ships had ever operated with the Home Fleet. Washington was damaged on 1 May when King George V accidentally rammed the destroyer , cutting it in two. Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea as the sinking destroyer, receiving damage from depth charges as they went down with the ship and exploded as they sank. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on the ship were damaged, including all of the main battery range finders and three circuit breakers. In addition, three fire control systems and the radar were put out of action from <b>mechanical</b> <b>shock.</b> King George V, her bow heavily damaged, was forced to leave the task force with an escort of destroyers to be repaired.|$|E
