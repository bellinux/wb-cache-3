30|$|In {{contrast}} to the reported strengths, eco-certification has earned significant criticism when applied to extensive shrimp value chains. Ha et al. (2013) found that although a suitable model for mixed shrimp–mangrove systems, organic certification might not be sustainable when the farmers producing the products do not benefit from the respective value chains. High transaction costs {{for the establishment of}} a certification scheme have been identified as a major challenge when working with smallholders and consequently, eco-certification might marginalize small-holders from participation in export-oriented value chains (Tran et al. 2013; Marschke <b>and</b> <b>Wilkings</b> 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} {{composition of}} fruit from four Citrus varieties (Powell Navel orange, Clemenules <b>mandarine,</b> <b>and</b> Fortune <b>mandarine</b> <b>and</b> Chandler pummelo) covering four different species has been studied. Over one hundred compounds were profiled after HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis, including 27 esters, 23 aldehydes, 21 alcohols, 13 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 10 ketones, 5 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 4 monoterpene cyclic ethers, 4 furans, and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons, which were all confirmed with standards. The {{differences in the}} volatile profile among juices of these varieties were essentially quantitative {{and only a few}} compounds were found exclusively in a single variety, mainly in Chandler. The volatile profile however was able to differentiate all four varieties and revealed complex interactions between them including the participation in the same biosynthetic pathway. Some compounds (6 esters, 2 ketones, 1 furan and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons) had never been reported earlier in Citrus juices. This volatile profiling platform for Citrus juice by HS-SPME-GC-MS and the interrelationship detected among the volatiles {{can be used as a}} roadmap for future breeding or biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we give a new {{generalization}} of positive sectional curvature called positive weighted sectional curvature. It {{depends on a}} choice of Riemannian metric and a smooth vector field. We give several simple examples of Riemannian metrics which do not have positive sectional curvature but support a vector field that gives them positive weighted curvature. On the other hand, we generalize {{a number of the}} foundational results for compact manifolds with positive sectional curvature to positive weighted curvature. In particular, we prove generalizations of Weinstein's theorem, O'Neill's formula for submersions, Frankel's theorem, <b>and</b> <b>Wilking's</b> connectedness lemma. As applications of these results, we recover weighted versions of topological classification results of Grove-Searle and Wilking for manifolds of high symmetry rank and positive curvature...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometry}} of Riemannian symmetric spaces is really richer {{than that of}} Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Nevertheless, there exists a large literature of special classes of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds with an important list of features which are typical for a Riemannian symmetric space. Normal homogeneous spaces, naturally reductive homogeneous spaces or g. o. spaces are some interesting examples of these classes of spaces where, in particular, the Jacobi equation can be also written as a differential equation with constant coefficients and the osculating rank of the Jacobi operator is constant. Compact rank one symmetric spaces are among the very few manifolds that are known to admit metrics with positive sectional curvature. In fact, there exist only three non-symmetric (simply-connected) normal homogeneous spaces with positive curvature: V 1 = Sp(2) /SU(2), V 2 = SU(5) /(Sp(2) × S 1), given by M. Berger <b>and</b> the <b>Wilking’s</b> example V 3 = (SU(3) � SO(3)) /U&#x 2022;(2). Here, we show some geometric properties of all these spaces, properties related with the existence of isotropic Jacobi fields and {{the determination of the}} constant osculating rank of the Jacobi operator. It provides different way to ”measure” of how they are so close or not to the class of compact rank one symmetric spaces...|$|R

40|$|This final project {{report was}} written {{based on the}} job {{training}} in Tourist Information Center (TIC) of Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata (DISBUDPAR) Surakarta for the period of March 2013. The writer used observation, interview and literatute study in the process of collecting the data. The objectives of this final project report are to describe the general description of DISBUDPAR Surakarta and the writer‟s activities during the job training, to figure out the strengths of TIC of DISBUDPAR Surakarta and to figure out the weaknesses of TIC of DISBUDPAR Surakarta. The result of this final project report shows the strengths of TIC of DISBUDPAR Surakarta are having competent staffs and giving free charge of information. TIC has the competent staffs who are mastering five foreign languages (English, <b>Mandarine,</b> Chinese, Japanese <b>and</b> German) to support their duties as a front officer. The second strength is giving free charge of information. It becomes the strength of TIC of DISBUDPAR Surakarta because in other TIC, the tourists will be asked for the charge for the information they need. The result of this final project report also shows the weaknesses. The first weakness is a lack number of the staffs. TIC has only two staffs, it is inefficient in giving the service to the tourists. The second weakness is a lack number of supporting facilities. Printed media information is the only supporting facility in TIC. There is no other supporting facilities such as computers connected to the internet and vehicles for transportation. The last weakness is the non strategic location. TIC is located behind Graha Wisata Building and Radya Pustaka Museum. It makes the building can not be found by the tourist easily. Hopefully, this final project report can be beneficial for the readers in understanding TIC of DISBUDPAR Surakarta. ...|$|R
