50|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) {{is a type}} of cancer {{affecting}} blood cells that eventually develop into non-lymphocyte white blood cells. The disease originates from the bone marrow, the soft inner portion of select bones where blood stem cells develop into either lymphocyte or in this particular condition, myeloid cells. This acute disease prevents bone marrow cells from properly maturing, thus causing an accumulation of immature <b>myeloblast</b> cells in the bone marrow.|$|E
50|$|In {{rare cases}} the erythroid lineage {{is the only}} obvious {{component}} of an acute leukemia; a <b>myeloblast</b> component is not apparent. The erythroid component consists predominantly or exclusively of proerythroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts. These cells may constitute 90% {{or more of the}} marrow elements. Despite this lack of myeloblasts, these cases should be considered acute leukemias.

While AML has been extensively studied from the perspectives of biochemical and genetic aspects, little is known about its cellular biophysical properties. In this study, optical tweezer technology was used to examine the micromechanical properties of <b>myeloblasts</b> from bone marrow of AML patients at single cell level. The <b>myeloblasts</b> were separately analyzed according to their expression of CD 34 +, a marker of primitive hematopoietic cells. To extract the intrinsic properties from the relationship between the stretching force and the induced deformation, a theoretical approach was developed to model the mechanical responses of cells and further characterize their mechanical properties. The preliminary results show that the area compressibility modulus of CD 34 + <b>myeloblasts</b> was significantly less than that of CD 34 - cells, which indicate that micromechanical properties are unique features of <b>myeloblasts</b> and provide us with an insight into the cell mechanics of primitive AML cells. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The mean labeling index of <b>myeloblasts</b> from CML patients when the white blood cell (WBC) count was lower than 20, 000 /cu mm (42. 4 %) was {{not significantly different from}} that of normal <b>myeloblasts</b> (49. 9).

The mean labeling index of CML myelocytes was not significantly influenced by the level of WBC. The data presented indicate that such variations in the labeling index of the leukemic <b>myeloblasts</b> represent changes of their proliferative activity related to the level of WBC.

Using monospecific antisera for immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have detected gag gene-related proteins in the <b>myeloblasts.</b> The DU 1765 and DU 11157 cells contained a p 100 protein which possessed antigenic determinants of the viral proteins p 27, p 19, p 15, and p 12. The p 100 was not found in leukemic <b>myeloblasts</b> from Spafas chickens, and pulse-chase experiments showed that the p 100 was not a precursor for the viral proteins. However, the p 100 is present in uninfected line 15 chicken embryos. A pr 76 -like protein was identified in DU 1765 cells but migrated slightly further into gels than the pr 76 of Spafas-derived leukemic <b>myeloblasts.</b> The Spafas-derived <b>myeloblasts</b> produced a pr 60, whereas the DU 1765 cells contained instead a related protein of 62, 000 daltons.
