60|$|The newborn {{child is}} at first {{no more than}} an animal. Indeed, it is among the lowest and most {{helpless}} of all animals, a mere vegetative lump; assimilation incarnate--wailing. It is for the first day in its life deaf, it squints blindly at the world, its limbs are beyond its control, its hands clutch drowningly at anything whatever that drifts upon this vast sea of being into which it has plunged so amazingly. And imperceptibly, subtly, so subtly that never at any time can we mark with certainty the increment of its coming, there creeps into this soft and claimant little creature a mind, a will, a personality, the beginning of all that is real and spiritual in man. In a little while there are eyes full of interest and clutching hands full of purpose, smiles and frowns, the babbling beginning of expression and affections and aversions. Before the first year is out there is obedience and rebellion, choice and self-control, speech has commenced, and the struggle of the newcomer to stand on his feet in this world of men. The process is unanalyzable; given a certain <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and protection, these things come spontaneously; with the merest rough encouragement of things and voices about the child, they are evoked.|$|E

40|$|As the United States {{seeks to}} improve the value <b>of</b> health <b>care,</b> there is an urgent need to develop quality {{measurement}} for emergency departments (EDs). EDs provide 130 million patient visits per year and are involved in half of all hospital admissions. Efforts to measure ED quality are in their infancy, focusing on a small set of conditions and timeliness measures, such as waiting times and length-of-stay. We review the history of ED quality measurement, identify policy levers for implementing performance measures, and propose a measurement agenda. Initial priorities include <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>care</b> for serious conditions that are commonly seen in EDs, such as trauma; <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> efficient use of resources, such as high-cost imaging and hospital admission; and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic accuracy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Performance {{reporting}} is increasingly focused on physician practice sites and individual physicians. OBJECTIVE: To assess {{the reliability of}} performance measurement for practice sites and individual physicians. RESEARCH DESIGN: We used data collected across multiple payers {{as part of a}} statewide measurement collaborative to evaluate the observed measure reliability and sample size requirements to achieve acceptable reliability <b>of</b> 4 Health <b>Care</b> Effectiveness Data and Information Set <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>care</b> and 10 Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> chronic <b>care</b> across 334 practice sites. We conducted a parallel set of physician-level analyses using data across 118 primary physicians practicing within a large multispecialty group. MEASURES: Observed reliabilities and estimated sample size requirements to achieve reliability >/= 0. 70. RESULTS: At the practice site level, sample sizes required to achieve a reliability of 0. 70 were less than 200 patients per site for all 4 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>care,</b> all 4 process <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care,</b> and 2 outcomes <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care.</b> Larger samples were required to achieve reliability for cholesterol screening in the presence of cardiovascular disease (n = 249) and use of appropriate asthma medications (n = 351). At the physician level, less than 200 patients were required for all 4 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>care,</b> but for many chronic <b>care</b> <b>measures</b> the samples <b>of</b> patients available per physician were not sufficient to achieve a reliability of 0. 70. CONCLUSION: In a multipayer collaborative, sample sizes were adequate to reliably assess clinical process and outcome measures at the practice site level. For individual physicians, sample sizes proved adequate to reliably measure preventive care, but may not be feasible for chronic care assessment...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{reporting}} patient satisfaction {{has become an}} important feature of the healthcare landscape. In countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, measures of patient satisfaction are increasingly being employed as drivers of quality and accountability. Patient satisfaction has also been tied to value-based purchasing {{as part of a}} suite of strategies seeking to drive improved performance and efficiency. In a number of countries investigations into largescale care failures have also reported failure to listen to patients as a key factor in these failures (Garling 2008, Thomḗ 2009), leading to refocused efforts to improve patient satisfaction. As part of this patient satisfaction agenda, nurses have changed leadership practices and re-designed nursing care delivery in efforts to improve patient satisfaction. Yet the merits (or otherwise) of employing patient satisfaction as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> quality remain unclear. Given the continued attention to patient satisfaction it is important to establish whether satisfaction is an adequate or appropriate primary indicator of nursing care quality.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a psychometric scale – the birth {{satisfaction}} scale (BSS) – for assessing women’s birth perceptions. Design/methodology/approach – Literature review and transcribed research-based perceived birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction expression statements were converted into a scored questionnaire. Findings – Three overarching themes were identified: service provision (home assessment, birth environment, support, relationships with health care professionals); personal attributes (ability to cope during labour, feeling in control, childbirth preparation, relationship with baby); and stress experienced during labour (distress, obstetric injuries, receiving sufficient medical care, obstetric intervention, pain, long labour and baby’s health). Research limitations/implications – Women construct their birth experience differently. Views are directed by personal beliefs, reactions, emotions and reflections, which alter in relation to mood, humour, disposition, frame of mind and company kept. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals can use BSS to assess women’s birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Scores measure their service quality experiences. Social implications – Scores provide a global <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> that women perceived they received during labour. Originality/value – Finding out more about what causes birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction helps maternity care professionals improve intra-natal care standards and allocate resources effectively. An attempt has been made to capture birth satisfaction’s generalised meaning and incorporate it into an evidence-based measuring tool...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Door to balloon time (D 2 BT) is {{a quality}} <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for ST segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). We {{postulate}} that aggressive {{efforts to reduce}} D 2 BT may lead to increased false positive (FP) STEMI diagnoses. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 1006 consecutive patients from two yearly intervals between July 2008 to June 2010, who presented to our hospital with symptoms and EKG concerning for STEMI, was performed. During this time, successful efforts to reduce D 2 BT occurred. Incidence of cath lab activation (heart alerts), emergent cardiac catheterization (heart codes) were compared. We also compared the D 2 BT and the incidence of FP heart codes (emergent catheterization, no coronary disease) for each year Results: Recent D 2 BT decreased signi!cantly compared to the previous year. STEMI Incidence has remained the same but, there was a slightly increased incidence of emergent cardiac catheterization and a trend towards increased incidence of FP heart codes. Some of the latter patients had delay in receiving appropriate care for urgent non-cardiac conditions. Conclusion: Aggressively pushing the D 2 BT down may increase unnecessary emergent cardiac catheterization. Efforts to reduce D 2 BT have to be monitored systematically to avoid unnecessary procedures and delay in appropriate care for critically ill patients. Careful evaluation of the patient before emergent cardiac cath is essential...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{number of}} {{countries}} adopting per case hospital payment systems has been continuously increasing in recent years. Nonetheless, debates persist regarding their consequences for equity of access to services. This concern relates {{to the failure of}} diagnostic classifications properly to take into account patients' care requirements, raising the threat of case selection ('cream skimming'). We examine the heterogeneity of costs within diagnostic categories related to socioeconomic (SE) factors using length of stay (LOS) as a proxy <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> needs and costs. We evaluate its consequences in terms of fairness in resource allocation between hospitals. METHODS: We employ data on all discharges in 2002 - 03 from a sample of 60 Belgian hospitals (617, 275 observations), measuring the association between LOS and SE factors using generalized linear models. We design a resource allocation formula based on the Belgian financing scheme, where non-medical activity is paid based on a normative number of in-patient days, and measure financial penalties and rewards according to whether payment is adjusted for the SE characteristics of patients or not. RESULTS: Both patients' SE status and hospitals' area SE profile {{have a significant impact on}} LOS, which persists after controlling for detailed diagnostic and hospital characteristics. Hospitals treating low income patients are financially penalized as a result. CONCLUSION: SE factors are a predictor of in-patient LOS and should be taken into account in per case resource allocation among hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{small scale}} studies have {{documented}} {{that when people}} {{assume the role of}} assisting a person with impairments or an older person, care activities account for a significant portion of their daily routines. Nevertheless, little research has investigated the problem of measuring the time that carers spend in care-related activities. This paper contrasts two different measures of care time – an estimated average weekly hours question in the 1998 Australian Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, and diary estimates from the 1997 national Australian Time Use Survey. This study finds that diaries provide information for a more robust estimate, but only after one models the time use patterns in the days of carers to identify care-related activities, which diarists do not necessarily record as care. Such a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> time reveals that even people who offer only occasional assistance to a person with impairments tend to spend the equivalent of more than 10 minutes a day providing care. Most caregivers undertake the equivalent of a part-time job to help a friend or family member. Summing the average caregiving time provided by all household members reveals that over a quarter of Australian households caring for an adult or child provide the equivalent of a full-time employee’s labour, and another quarter work between 20 and 39 total weekly hours to provide informal care.

40|$|Objective: Continuity of care is {{considered}} foundational to high-quality care. Traditional {{continuity of care}} constructs may adequately characterize care quality in general populations, but may merit reconceptualization for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, interactions between multiple chronic condition patients and providers involve complex medication management; therefore care continuity measurement may be more relevant if focused on the provider subset who prescribes essential medications for chronic conditions—a construct we call continuity of medication management. Our objective was to explore conceptual distinctions between continuity of medication management and continuity of care, survey existing evidence in this area, and discuss implications of our findings for future research and intervention development. Methods: In this topical review, we discuss conceptual distinctions between continuity of medication management and continuity of care, review the limited continuity of medication management–related empirical evidence, and discuss implications for future research and interventions. Results: Continuity of medication management represents a potential conceptual and measurement advance by reflecting interpersonal continuity and management continuity, and may provide a means of identifying patients at high-risk of adverse events. Empirical evidence also establishes support for continuity of medication management as a meaningful <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> continuity. Finally, continuity of medication management {{may also be a}} potential target for future intervention to improve care delivery among multiple chronic condition patients. Conclusion: If continuity of medication management is validated in diverse populations, correlated with patient outcomes, and responsive to change, then it may be an important target for improving the health and health care of multiple chronic condition patients...|$|E

Failure modes and effects analysis was used by a multidisciplinary team to validate these measures and prioritize them in terms of associated risk. Forty sets of case notes were reviewed by two independent teams and the inter-rater reliability was determined using observed percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. We used the data to calculate the proportion of patients in whom we are currently meeting targets for good quality <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Results: The multidisciplinary team did not identify any additional areas of concern and assigned the highest risk priority to a delay of over 4 h from recognition of sepsis to antibiotic administration.

40|$|Background: Pre-ART, {{defined as}} all {{services}} provided between the timeframe {{of a patient}} testing positive to HIV till the first dose of antiretroviral, can be a crucial period in patient retention and attrition. Therefore, this study aims to examine practices around facility level Pre-ART throughout Ethiopia based on discussions with clinicians and facility staff and to determine potential considerations for country specific Pre-ART guidelines and future public health practice in other resource constrained countries. Methods: Framework Analysis was applied to secondary data derived from key informant interviews with facility level clinicians and staff in Ethiopia regarding themes around Pre-ART. We identified significant data surrounding the practices and processes currently taking place at a sample of six sites. An exploratory understanding of the challenges and best practices surrounding Pre-ART was highlighted and themes to be taken under consideration by a Pre-ART guideline-working group in Ethiopia were noted. Results: Study sites indicated various service provisions and practices around Pre-ART care along the testing to treatment cascade. Patient tracking, Cotrimoxazole prescription, access to CD 4 machines, and data management practices varied by facility. Similar practices around linkages from testing to treatment were noted across facilities. Conclusion: Combining the local resource reservoir with a national guideline plan allow for the ideal meshing of top down and bottom up implementation and will minimize the pitfalls of system wide rollout of Pre-ART guidelines. The ultimate goals behind any Pre-ART program should be to provide a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and support which patient’s value. The benefits then derived from this valuation result in the key public health outcomes, namely in terms of patient retention, early initiation onto ART, and continued monitoring of patient progress across the testing to treatment cascade. Meeting these goals and objectives hinges on a collaborative effort and one that bridges the divide of policy makers and practitioners. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The use of {{epidural}} anaesthesia in delivery {{with the}} purpose to reduce pain and fear in a pregnant woman has the influence on the physiological status {{of the woman in}} childbirth and the course of delivery. From the epidural space of the pregnant woman, one part of free anaesthetic comes in the foetal circulation through the mother's circulation and placenta and connects with the foetal proteins. A lower value of albumins and serum proteins in the foetal circulation give bigger free fraction of anaesthetic which is accumulated in the foetal liver, brain and heart full of blood. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the influence of epidural anaesthesia on the newborn. Methods. Retrospective study of 6, 398 documents of newborns was performed in our Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics 'Narodni front' during 2006. The first group was made of 455 newborns from deliveries with epidural anaesthesia and the second was the control group of 5, 943 remaining newborns. In both groups we analysed the following: sex, week of gestation, weight, Apgar score, <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and resuscitation, perinatal morbidity and then the obtained results were compared. Results. Most of deliveries were vaginal without obstetric intervention (86. 6 %). The number of deliveries finished with vacuum extractor (4. 6 %) was statistically significantly bigger in the group with epidural anaesthesia than in the control group. Most of the newborns in the first group were born on time (96. 5 %) in 39. 0 ± 1. 0 week of gestation and with foetal weight 3448 ± 412 grammes. There was no statistical significance in Apgar score between both groups. Epidural anaesthesia does not increase the degree of the newborn's injury. Lower pH of blood was found in the newborns from deliveries with vacuum extractor or operated on (the Ceasarean section). Conclusion. Application of epidural anaesthesia decreases duration of delivery and has no adverse effects on the newborn and hypoxic encephalopathy is lower...|$|E

WebbThis study {{examined}} the relationships between and among the factors of compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and spiritual resiliency {{in association with the}} care work of United States Army chaplains who minister to soldiers, families, and Department of the Army (DA) civilians in the military. This investigation breaks new ground in understanding the factors that affect chaplain care work. Data were collected from 408 active duty Army chaplains who responded to and completed the online survey. Information about rank, years of service, battle fatigue/stress and number of deployments was collected. These data along with specific scales were combined into the Chaplain Care Work Model—the tool used in this investigation. Scores from three measurement instruments: Professional Quality of Life Scale R-IV, Spiritual Well-Being Scale, and the Resilience Scale were used to test the hypotheses for this study. Of particular interest, the measurement scales of Spiritual Well-Being and Resiliency were combined to develop a new measurement construct labeled Spiritual Resiliency. The model of Chaplain Care Work was tested using path analysis and structural equation modeling techniques to illustrate the relationships of the predictors (constructed from latent variables—Chaplaincy Status, Deployment Status, and Self Care) to the outcome <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Work (also a latent variable). Overall 85 % of the variance in care work {{can be attributed to the}} model’s predictors, adding to the value of examining care work among those who provide direct service to others. Findings indicated that spiritual resiliency ebbed and flowed as a function of the different levels of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction experienced by the chaplains because of their care work. Furthermore, number of deployments and experience (years of chaplain service) had significant relationships with compassion fatigue and burnout. Results from the findings were underpinned by explicit narrative comments provided by chaplains. These comments provided rich material in support of the significant relationships discovered in this study, and offered insights into how care work is both meaningful and necessary for maintaining a healthier chaplaincy...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{a context}} of {{increasing}} concern for complex care needs in medical patients, this study is intended to document the utility in pneumology patients of INTERMED, a reliable and valid instrument to assess case complexity {{at the time of}} hospital admission. Methods: Three hundred and fifteen consecutive patients were assessed at hospital admission with INTERMED by a trained nurse. At discharge, independent research workers, blind to the previous results, reviewed the medical database and a subsample (n = 144) was assessed for psychopathological outcome. Severity of the pulmonary disease was assessed with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), and psychopathology with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (cognitive disturbances), and CAGE Scale (alcohol abuse). Operational definitions were used for <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> complexity. Results: Most patients were in geriatric age, and 78 patients (24. 7 %) were classified as "complex" by means of INTERMED (IM+).

40|$|Background: A {{significant}} {{minority of}} patients {{do not receive}} all the evidence-based care recommended for their conditions. Health care quality may be improved by reducing this observed variation. Composite measures offer a different patient-centred perspective on quality and are utilized in acute hospitals via the ‘care bundle’ concept as indicators of the reliability of specific (evidence-based) care delivery tasks and improved outcomes. A care bundle consists {{of a number of}} time-specific interventions that should be delivered to every patient every time. We aimed to apply the care bundle concept to selected QOF data to measure the quality of evidence-based care provision. Methods: Care bundles and components were selected from QOF indicators according to defined criteria. Five clinical conditions were suitable for care bundles: Secondary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), Stroke & Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Each bundle has 3 - 8 components. A retrospective audit was undertaken in a convenience sample of nine general medical practices in the West of Scotland. Collected data included delivery (or not) of individual bundle components to all patients included on specific disease registers. Practice level and overall compliance with bundles and components were calculated in SPSS and expressed as a percentage. Results: Nine practices (64. 3 %) with a combined patient population of 56, 948 were able to provide data in the format requested. Overall compliance with developed QOF-based care bundles (composite measures) was as follows: CHD 64. 0 %, range 35. 0 - 71. 9 %; Stroke/TIA 74. 1 %, range 51. 6 - 82. 8 %; CKD 69. 0 %, range 64. 0 - 81. 4 %; and COPD 82. 0 %, range 47. 9 - 95. 8 %; and DM 58. 4 %, range 50. 3 - 65. 2 %. Conclusions: In this small study compliance with individual QOF-based care bundle components was high, but overall (‘all or nothing’) compliance was substantially lower. Care bundles may provide a more informed <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> quality than existing methods.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of surgical site infections (SSI) is considered increasingly {{to be an}} indicator of quality of care. We conducted a study in which daily inspection of the surgical incision was performed by an independent, trained team to monitor the {{incidence of}} SSI using U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions, as a gold-standard <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> In the department of surgery, two registration systems for SSI were used routinely by the surgeon: An electronic and a plenary tracking system. The results of the independent team were compared with the outcomes provided by two registration systems for SSI, so as to evaluate the reliability of these systems as a possible alternative for indicating quality of care. Methods: The study was an incidence study conducted from May 2007 to January 2009 that included 1, 000 adult patients scheduled to undergo open abdominal surgery in an academic teaching hospital. Surgical incisions were inspected daily to check for SSI according to definitions of health care-associated infections established by the CDC. Follow-up after discharge was done at the outpatient clinic of the hospital by telephone or letter in combination with patient diaries and reviews of patient charts, discharge letters, electronic files, and reported complications. Univariate and multivariable analyses were done to identify putative risk factors for missing registrations. Results: Of the 1, 000 patients in the study, 33 were not evaluated. Surgical site infections were diagnosed in 26. 8 % of the 967 remaining patients, of which 18. 0 % were superficial incisional infections, 5. 4 % were deep incisional infections, and 3. 4 % were organ/space infections. More than 60 % of SSIs were unreported in either of the department's two tracking systems for such infections. For these two systems, independent major risk factors for missing registrations were (1) the lack of occurrence of an SSI, (2) transplantation surgery, and (3) admission to non-surgical departments. Conclusions: Most SSIs were not tracked with the department's two systems. These systems proved poor alternatives to the gold-standard method of quantifying the incidence of Surgical Site Infection SSI and, therefore, the quality of care. Both protocolized wound assessment and on-site documentation are mandatory for realistic quantification of the incidence of SSI...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Awareness {{is the key}} to {{successful}} stroke rehabilitation and in practice poor knowledge of self-awareness and failure to recognise stroke deficits hinders efforts in the rehabilitation of patients. Stroke is associated with both functional and cognitive impairment, but the individual correlation between impairment, daily activities and self-awareness of deficit of stroke patients in the acute and sub-acute environment has yet to be explored. This research study aims to address the gap in the current evidence base, by identifying the degree of patient’s self-awareness of stroke-deficit in a sample of patients with sub-acute stroke and determine the strength of relationship between self-awareness and functional performance. Aim and Objectives The primary aim of this research was to examine the association between self- awareness and functional performance deficits across three domains (Basic ADL; Instrumental ADL and Cognition) in sub-acute stroke. The objectives were: 1. To identify patients’ self-awareness of stroke-deficit within three months of stroke. 2. To investigate the association between functional outcomes of ADL performance and self-awareness. Methods A cross sectional study using a sample of convenience was completed. Nineteen participants admitted to an acute hospital with first event stroke were assessed for awareness of deficit post stroke. Self-awareness was measured using the Self- Regulation Skills Interview (SRSI). A range of outcome measures were used to assess functional and cognitive performance. They included the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Kettle Test (KT), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Results The majority of participants presented with right sided stroke infarct of mild severity (74 %). The majority of participants presented with low-moderate levels of awareness (53 %) and were female (58 %). Significant correlations were demonstrated between the SRSI, MoCA and KT. The strongest correlation was found between the SRSI and the MoCA (r= - 0. 814), with a strong relationship also demonstrated between the SRSI and the KT (r= 0. 521). There was no relationship between the SRSI and the MBI (p= 0. 951; r=- 0. 015). The association between functional performance outcome measures and other variables was further examined using linear regression analysis. The SRSI explained no variance on the MBI (0 %), however explained 23. 3 % variance on the Kettle Test. Conclusion More than half of {{the participants in this study}} presented with only low-moderate self- awareness levels of stroke deficit. There was a strong association between self- awareness, cognition and one component of IADL performance as measured on the KT. No correlation was demonstrated between SRSI and MBI. Implications of Findings Self-awareness deficits are prevalent in the mild sub-acute stroke population. There is a high association between self-awareness, cognition and higher order activities of daily living (IADL). Screening of mild stroke patients for awareness deficits should be included as a standard <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Future research should address the development of a stroke-specific measure of awareness and standardisation of assessment...|$|E
