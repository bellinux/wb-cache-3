5000|$|Ocean liners also {{adopted a}} style of Art Deco, known in French as the Style Paquebot, or [...] "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS Normandie, which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was {{designed}} particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six <b>matching</b> <b>pillars</b> lined the walls. This {{was one of the}} earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.|$|R
50|$|Beyond this, {{in front}} of the South wall of the Basilica are two {{rectangular}} pillars always known as the Pillars of Acre. They were thought to be booty taken by the Venetians from Acre after their great victory over the Genoese there in 1258, but this traditional story has also had to be revised. The pillars actually came from the church of St Polyeuktos in Constantinople (524-7), and were probably taken by the Venetians soon after the fourth crusade in 1204. The ruins of this church were discovered in 1960 and it was excavated in the 1990s, when capitals were found, which <b>matched</b> the <b>pillars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The House at 15 Chestnut Street in Wakefield, Massachusetts {{is a well}} {{preserved}} high style Colonial Revival house. It {{was built}} in 1889 for Thomas Skinner, a Boston bookkeeper. The -story wood-frame house is topped by a hipped roof with flared eaves and a heavily decorated cornice. A porch extends {{across the front of}} the house, which is supported by paired turned columns. Above on the porch is a low railing with paired <b>pillars</b> (<b>matching</b> the support columns in position) topped by urns. The front door is flanked by Ionic pilasters, then sidelight windows, and then another pair of pilasters.|$|R
500|$|Also on the event's card, the TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Ultimate X match, {{with the}} {{participants}} being the champion, Petey Williams, {{and the two}} challengers being, A.J.

40|$|Recently the {{importance}} of a comprehensive policy evaluation has been increasingly recognized by international organizations, e. g. the World Bank, OECD and FAO as well as especially by the EU. In particular, for agricultural policies of the second pillar a comprehensive evaluation is obligatory. However, presently applied evaluation techniques are clearly lagging behind the ambiguous evaluation targets set by the EU Commission. Given the fact that a comprehensive policy evaluation is a very complex methodological challenge this discrepancy is not really surprising. Thus, nowadays it is still fair to conclude that adequate evaluation tools applicable to EU rural development policies do not exist yet. In this context this paper derives microeconometric evaluation techniques which have been developed within the EU research project ADVANCED-EVAL to evaluate RD policy programmes. In particular, the methodological shortcomings of simple evaluation techniques currently applied to evaluate EU RD policy programmes are demonstrated via a comparison of empirical evaluation results of SAPARD policies in Slovakia derived from these simple EU techniques with evaluation results derived from advanced microeconometric methods, i. e. propensity score matching. policy evaluation, propensity score <b>matching,</b> second <b>pillar</b> of the CAP, Agricultural and Food Policy, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R

40|$|James BrophyGerman big {{business}} and the Nazi Party held a dubious historical relationship during the Second World War, with industrialists helping to produce and run Hitler’s war machine with forced labor from the concentration camps. But the ties between industry and Nazism were not always so strong and clear-cut; before 1933 and Hitler’s acquiring of the German chancellorship, varying complex factors {{played a role in}} how the two groups viewed one another. Hitler and his ideological <b>pillars</b> <b>matched</b> well with the economic and political views of the Nazi business elite, and he attempted to build a relationship before 1933, through which he could secure funding from industrialists. Some historians have used this evidence to imply that German {{big business}} played a substantial role in funding the Nazi Party during its rise to power. My research, however, will disprove this point and also explain why, even with Hitler’s close ties to German industry, a relationship could not develop between the Nazi Party and business leaders. The project will focus considerably on the Nazi left-wing, which was the major road block in such a relationship taking flight. I will eventually prove that German big business did not provide major financial support to the Nazis before 1933, but also explain why the factors keeping the two groups apart would quickly disintegrate after Hitler’s coming to power. This rapid disintegration would allow for the wartime relationship between Nazism and Germany industry, as well as the conquest of much of Europe. Histor...|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Keyes for Semon Emil “Bunkie” Knudsen (Executive Vice President of General Motors Company and President of Ford Motor Company), Knudsen Mansion {{has been}} {{described}} as a “lovely,” “rambling family home,” a “huge mansion,” and “a sprawling, twelve-room colonial farmhouse, with two tennis courts and a swimming pool, on 40 acres in suburban Birmingham, Mich.” Keyes returned again to mixing building materials that he used the previous year at Welch House—in this case using stone gable faces against the house’s brick—as well as retractable fabric awnings framing the windows (a detail Keyes had occasionally used elsewhere, such as on Welch House, Buhs House and Windmill Pointe). White iron rails decorate the upper windows. Keyes connected the main wing and the large garage wing of the asymmetric house with a line of single-story, flat-roofed sun rooms, one with a large circular skylight. The back patio is of brick, framed by low brick walls. Stone <b>pillars</b> (<b>matching</b> the stone of the house) and iron gates mark the entrance to a long winding drive through thick woods (and 24-hour security) that finally ends at the mansion. The estate is the largest of any of Keyes’s projects, as well as the most hidden from view (followed in both cases by Woodland). Upon being fired from Ford in 1971, Knudsen moved to Cleveland and sold his mansion (after subdividing, containing less than half of the original property) two years later to David Hermelin (United States ambassador to Norway and Detroit area philanthropist and entrepreneur), who would have major additions built on the house (including enormous structures which partially overlap Keyes’s original rooflines) and whose widow is still the owner. (Hermelin was known to host major Presidential fund raisers for Bill Clinton at Knudsen Mansion—which is also known as the Hermelin House.) ...|$|R
