5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and one small camper. A <b>microburst</b> in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001USD, $520,000 2012USD).|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a new {{investigation}} of <b>microbursts</b> at meter-decameter wavelengths are reported. Several properties of <b>microbursts</b> reported earlier are confirmed, and some new properties, such as time profile characteristics, flux density, and energy spectra are studied in order to compare the properties of <b>microbursts</b> with those of normal type III bursts. Electron beams of similar characteristics are found to generate both <b>microbursts</b> and type III bursts. Plasma waves generated by the electron beams due to beam-plasma instability are quickly isotropized as they scatter on the density fluctuations in the corona, leading to the low brightness temperature of <b>microbursts.</b> The resulting low levels of plasma waves produce transverse radiation of low brightness temperature. As {{a result of the}} isotropization, the second harmonic plasma emission dominates the fundamental, so that <b>microbursts</b> are expected to be primarily a harmonic plasma emission...|$|R

Here we discuss one such system which analyses Doppler and reflectivity radar volumes to detect <b>microbursts</b> (windshear events). The system employs a network of agents, each performing a subtask of the detection, with message passing between agents. The various agents detect reflectivity cores, high divergent shear zones, <b>microbursts</b> and track <b>microbursts</b> through time.

5000|$|Wet <b>microbursts</b> are downbursts {{accompanied}} by significant precipitation {{at the surface}} which are warmer than their environment (Wakimoto, 1998). These downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of parcels than negative buoyancy which tend to drive [...] "dry" [...] <b>microbursts.</b> As a result, higher mixing ratios are necessary for these downbursts to form (hence the name [...] "wet" [...] <b>microbursts).</b> Melting of ice, particularly hail, appears {{to play an important}} role in downburst formation (Wakimoto and Bringi, 1988), especially in the lowest 1 km above ground level (Proctor, 1989). These factors, among others, make forecasting wet <b>microbursts</b> difficult.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all <b>microburst</b> wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) <b>microburst</b> intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} affected 507,831people on the island; {{it resulted}} in 16deaths14of which confirmedand 42injuries. In Saint Andrew Parish's Sandy Park, a house next to a street gully succumbed {{to the effects of}} the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish. Rushing waters swept away three people {{in different parts of the}} island, all of whom drowned. Amid a <b>microburst,</b> a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.|$|E

The importance of this result is explored. A single model to explain the stronger type III bursts and the weaker <b>microbursts</b> is sought. It is shown {{that none of the}} models for stabilizing the strongest type III electron streams can explain the observed microbursts: these models have threshold levels of Langmuir waves which imply emission (due to spontaneous scattering off ions) with brightness temperatures in excess of those observed. It appears that either some vital physics is still missing from models for type III bursts, or that <b>microbursts</b> should have properties significantly different from those of type III bursts. In the latter case further observations should allow important tests of type III models...|$|R

500|$|A <b>microburst</b> {{is a very}} {{localized}} {{column of}} sinking air known as a downburst, producing damaging divergent and straight-line winds at the surface {{that are similar to}} but distinguishable from tornadoes which generally have convergent damage. [...] The term was defined as affecting an area [...] in diameter or less, distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas. They are normally associated with individual thunderstorms. <b>Microburst</b> soundings show the presence of mid-level dry air, which enhances evaporative cooling.|$|E
40|$|Electron <b>microbursts</b> are rapid {{fluctuations}} of electron fluxes occurring on {{time scales}} of milliseconds.

They may be a major process of loss of realtivistic electrons from the Earth's outer radiation belts. One of the key issues that new mission s such as RBSP will address is to understand the loss of relativistic electrons.

500|$|A macroburst, {{normally}} {{associated with}} squall lines, {{is a strong}} downburst larger than [...] [...] A wet <b>microburst</b> consists of precipitation and an atmosphere saturated in the low-levels. A dry <b>microburst</b> emanates from high-based thunderstorms with virga falling from their base. [...] All types are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface. Downbursts can occur over large areas. In the extreme case, a derecho can cover a huge area more than [...] wide and over [...] long, lasting up to 12 hours or more, and is associated {{with some of the}} most intense straight-line winds, but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most downbursts.|$|E
500|$|Low-level outflow {{boundaries}} from thunderstorms are {{cooler and}} more moist than the air mass the thunderstorm originally formed within {{due to its}} wet bulbing by rain, forming a wedge of denser air which spreads out {{from the base of}} the parent thunderstorm.

Damage was heaviest in Guantánamo Province, where 9mi (17km) of seawalls and two aqueducts were destroyed. The storm damaged or destroyed 43bridges, damaged 1,106mi (1,779km) of roads, and wrecked 16.5mi (26.5km) of rail lines. About 3mi (5km) of underground electrical cables were damaged. There was heavy agricultural damage in southeastern Cuba, estimated at about $45million. Gordon damaged 7,482acres (3,028hectares) of sugar cane fields and damaged or destroyed about 5.5million banana trees. About 100,000sacks of coffee were wrecked, amounting to $3.5million in damage, and 50,000litres of milk were ruined. While Gordon was paralleling northern Cuba, it produced high seas that caused flooding, including in Havana. Nationwide, the storm damaged 5,750houses and destroyed 156others. The cost of damage and reconstruction of homes and roads was $47.4million, {{and there was an}} additional $9.5million in damage to public buildings. Gordon killed two people in the country, which was kept to a minimum due to evacuations, and damage totaled $102million. Two people were injured at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The flooding from Gordon followed two other similarly damaging events in the preceding year.|$|E
500|$|Outflow {{boundaries}} create low-level {{wind shear}} {{which can be}} hazardous during aircraft takeoffs and landings. If a thunderstorm runs into an outflow boundary, the low-level wind shear from the boundary can cause thunderstorms to exhibit rotation {{at the base of}} the storm, at times causing tornadic activity. Strong versions of these features known as downbursts can be generated in environments of vertical wind shear and mid-level dry air. <b>Microbursts</b> have a diameter of influence less than , while macrobursts occur over a diameter greater than [...] Wet <b>microbursts</b> occur in atmospheres where the low levels are saturated, while dry <b>microbursts</b> occur in drier atmospheres from high-based thunderstorms. When an outflow boundary moves into a more stable low level environment, such as into a region of cooler air or over regions of cooler water temperatures out at sea, it can lead to the development of an undular bore.|$|R

50|$|Downbursts {{are created}} by an area of {{significantly}} rain-cooled air that, after reaching ground level, spreads out in all directions producing strong winds.

Another variety, the heat burst, is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and squall lines where rainfall is lacking.

The ground-based VLF receiver at Andφya (L= 6. 1), located at 160 km northeast of Stamsund, and at Syowa Station, Antarctica (L= 6. 1) observed polar chorus emissions and quasi-periodic (QP) emissions during the balloon flight. In the study of cross correlations between the X-ray and the VLF emissions, {{it has been found}} that the X-ray <b>microbursts</b> precede VLF chorus at Andφya by about 1. 7 s, while the VLF chorus at Syowa occurred almost simultaneously with the X-ray <b>microbursts.</b> This is qualitatively explained by the nature of counterstreaming type wave-particle interaction and the echoing of whistler mode wave packets in the magnetosphere. X-ray pulsations and rising-tone type QP emissions with periods of 20 - 30 s showed a good coherency. This similarity suggests that both phenomena are closely related to each other through the cyclotron wave-particle interaction in the magnetosphere...|$|R
