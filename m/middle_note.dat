6000|$|There is some danger, however, {{in giving}} {{instances}} like this; seeing {{that as the}} mode of rendering will {{vary according to the}} intensity of the feeling which the reader feigns to himself, the right cadence may not be hit upon. With single words there is less difficulty. Thus the [...] "Indeed!" [...] with which a surprising fact is received, mostly begins on the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> of the voice, and rises with the second syllable; or, if disapprobation as well as astonishment is felt, the first syllable will be below the <b>middle</b> <b>note,</b> and the second lower still. Conversely, the word [...] "Alas!" [...] which marks not the rise of a paroxysm of grief, but its decline, is uttered in a cadence descending towards the middle note; or, if the first syllable is in {{the lower part of the}} register, the second ascends towards the <b>middle</b> <b>note.</b> In the [...] "Heigh-ho!" [...] expressive of mental and muscular prostration, we may see the same truth; and if the cadence appropriate to it be inverted, the absurdity of the effect clearly shows how the meaning of intervals is dependent on the principle we have been illustrating.|$|E

5000|$|A unique particularity of {{the minor}} chord {{is that this is}} the only chord of three notes in which the three notes have one {{harmonic}} - hearable and with a not too high row - in common (more or less exactly, depending on the tuning system used).

50|$|For a bird of {{such great}} size, the great slaty {{woodpecker}} has a weak, quiet voice, especially {{compared to other}} large woodpeckers, which tend to have loud, booming voices. The species call is a whinnying cackle of 2 to 5, usually 4 notes, woikwoikwoikwoik, the initial being higher in pitched and the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> being distinctly lower. Single dwot calls, variable in sound, strength and duration, are sometimes given while perched or in flight. Breeding pairs of these woodpeckers have been heard to softly mew at each other. In more antagonistic situations, sharp taw-whit or dew-it calls are uttered while the birds swing their heads back and forth.|$|E
50|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{behind the}} perfume was her late mother. She {{explained that the}} oldest memory she cherished about her mother was the perfume she put on. Describing the scent as consisting of gardenias and tuberose, Madonna revealed that she carries that perfume everywhere she goes. To create the particular smell that she had in mind, Madonna collaborated with Stephen Nilsen, who had previously produced fragrances for designers like Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan and Tom Ford. After the scent was developed, they believed the finished product to be a modern interpretation of Madonna's mother's perfume. The top note of Truth or Dare consists of essences from gardenia and tuberose, jasmine was embedded in the <b>middle</b> <b>note,</b> and the base {{was a mixture of}} vanilla and musk.|$|E

5000|$|With change-valves, the {{diatonic}} hydraulophone is polyphonic in {{the same}} sense as a so-called [...] "chromatic harmonica" [...] - you can play chords and move all members of a chord down one semitone or up one semitone together, but the function of the valves is usually not separated to work on a per-note basis, so for example, you can play an A-minor chord, and flex the entire chord down to A-flat minor, but you can't easily play an A major chord without the use of polyphonic embouchure to bend only the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> to a C (which requires more skill than the average hydraulist has). Thus the [...] "diatonic" [...] hydraulophone is called [...] "diatonic" [...] conservatively to [...] "under promise and over-deliver".|$|E
5000|$|Their {{distinctive}} calls {{consists of}} three or four notes with the a drop on the <b>middle</b> <b>note.</b> The antiphonal duet of a male and female has the male leading with a [...] "poor'ol bear" [...] followed by the females [...] "dear dear". The tunes may however change over time. The birds tend to remain within a well marked area and do not wander widely. The song is a variable short series of around three to four notes of rich, fluty, liquid, slurred, short whistled notes; these are sometimes delivered haltingly and sometimes rapidly. The evening group song consists of a recurrent sputtering churrr sound, which is low and slurred; ending with a sharp chreep. Calls include soft mewing notes, and a pulsing, purring trill when agitated.|$|E
50|$|In this notation, which assumes G as the tonic or 1/1, a 7 lowers a pitch from a just {{intonation}} {{value by}} 35/36, or 48.77 cents; an upside-down 7 raises a pitch {{by the same}} amount. The first chord is a major triad and, relative to G, contains the notes 8/7 (231 cents above G), 10/7 (617 cents), and 12/7 (933 cents); the second chord is a minor triad comprising the pitches 7/6 (267 cents), 7/5 (583 cents), and 7/4 (969 cents). Notice that while the outer notes ascend from the first chord to the second, the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> descends. Such subtle movements were among the attractions that Partch found in an expanded just intonation of more than 12 pitches per octave. Tonality flux is a special instance {{of the principle of}} parsimonious (most direct) voice leading.|$|E

5000|$|In musical notation, stems are the, [...] "thin, {{vertical}} {{lines that}} are {{directly connected to}} the note head." [...] Stems may point up or down. Different-facing stems indicate the voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff. Within one voice, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem originates from {{the right-hand side of}} the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a chord contains a second, the stem runs between the two notes with the higher being placed on the right of the stem and the lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of the stem, while the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> will be on the wrong side.|$|E
5000|$|Several singers {{singing a}} melody together. In orchestral music unison {{can mean the}} {{simultaneous}} playing of a note (or a series of notes constituting a melody) by different instruments, either at the same pitch; or in a different octave, for example, cello and double bass (all'unisono). Typically a section string player plays unison {{with the rest of}} the section. Occasionally the Italian word divisi (meaning divided, abbrev. div.) marks a point where an instrumental section, typically the first violins, is to be divided into two groups for rendering passages that might, for example, include full chords. Thus, in the divisi first violins the [...] "outside" [...] players (nearer the audience) might play the top note of the chord, while the [...] "inside" [...] seated players play the <b>middle</b> <b>note,</b> and the second violins play the bottom note. At the point where the first violins no longer play divisi, the score may indicate this with unison (abbrev. unis.).|$|E
5000|$|Though less used than ancohemitonic scales, the cohemitonic scales have an {{interesting}} property. The sequence of two (or more) consecutive halfsteps in a scale presents the opportunity to [...] "split" [...] the scale by placing the tonic note of the scale on the <b>middle</b> <b>note</b> of the halfstep span. This allows a leading tone from below resolving upwards, {{as well as a}} descending flat-supertonic upper neighbor, both converging on the tonic. The split turns a weakness - dissonance of cohemitonia - to a strength: contrapuntal convergence on the tonic. It is very common that a cohemitonic (or even hemitonic) scale (e.g.: Hungarian minor { C D E F G A B }) be displaced preferentially to a mode where the halfstep span is split (e.cont.: Double harmonic scale { G A B C D E F }), and by which name we more commonly know the same circular series of intervals. [...] Cohemitonic scales with multiple halfstep spans present the additional possibility of modulating between tonics each furnished with both upper and lower neighbors.|$|E

These notes are created carefully {{with knowledge of the}} evaporation process of the perfume.|$|R
