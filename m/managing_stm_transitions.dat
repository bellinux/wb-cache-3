40|$|Abstract—Scaling of CMOS {{technology}} into nanometric feature sizes has raised {{concerns for the}} reliable operation of logic circuits, {{such as in the}} presence of soft errors. This paper deals with the analysis of the operation of sequential circuits. As the feedback signals in a sequential circuit can be logically masked by specific combinations of primary inputs, the cumulative effects of soft errors can be eliminated. This phenomenon, referred to as error masking, is related to the presence of so-called restoring inputs and/or the consecutive presence of specific inputs in multiple clock cycles (equivalent to a synchronizing sequence in switching theory). In this paper, error masking is extensively analyzed using the operations of state <b>transition</b> matrices (<b>STMs)</b> and binary decision diagrams (BDDs) of a finite state machine (FSM) model. The characteristics of state transitions with respect to correlations between the restoring inputs and time sequence are mathematically established using STMs; although the applicability of the STM analysis is restricted due to its complexity, the BDD approach is more efficient and scalable for use in the analysis of large circuits. These results are supported by simulations of benchmark circuits and may provide a basis for further devising efficient and robust implementations when designing FSMs. Index Terms—Finite state machines (FSMs), Error masking, Sequential circuits, State <b>transition</b> matrices (<b>STMs),</b> <b>Transition</b> probability matrices, Binary decision diagrams (BDDs), Soft errors...|$|R
40|$|Model {{checking}} software transactional memories (STMs) {{is difficult}} because of the unbounded number, length, and delay of concurrent transactions and the unbounded size of the memory. We show that, under certain conditions, the verification problem {{can be reduced to}} a finite-state problem, and we illustrate the use of the method by proving the correctness of several STMs, including two-phase locking, DSTM, TL 2, and optimistic concurrency control. The safety properties we consider include strict serializability and opacity; the liveness properties include obstruction freedom, livelock freedom, and wait freedom. Our main contribution lies {{in the structure of the}} proofs, which are largely automated and not restricted to the STMs mentioned above. In a first step we show that every STM that enjoys certain structural properties either violates a safety or liveness requirement on some program with two threads and two shared variables, or satisfies the requirement on all programs. In the second step we use a model checker to prove the requirement for the STM applied to a most general program with two threads and two variables. In the safety case, the model checker constructs a simulation relation between two carefully constructed finite-state transition systems, one representing the given STM applied to a most general program, and the other representing a most liberal safe STM applied to the same program. In the liveness case, the model checker analyzes fairness conditions on the given <b>STM</b> <b>transition</b> system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParallel {{programs}} need {{to manage}} the time trade-off between synchronization and computation. A high parallelism may decrease computing time but meanwhile increase synchronization cost. Software Transactional Memory (STM) {{has emerged as a}} promising technique, which bypasses locks, to address synchronization issues through transactions. A way to reduce conflicts is by adjusting parallelisms. However, there is no universal rule to decide the best parallelism for a program from an offline view. Furthermore, an offline tuning is costly and error-prone. Hence, it becomes necessary to adopt a dynamical tuning-configuration strategy to better <b>manage</b> a <b>STM</b> system. Autonomic computing offers designers a framework of methods and techniques to build systems with well-mastered behaviours. Its key idea is to implement feedback control loops to design safe, efficient and predictable controllers, which enable monitoring and adjusting controlled systems dynamically while keeping overhead low...|$|R

The (4 x 4) pattern arose at T <~ 600 C during sample posttreatment cooling. The reconstruction was observed to be reversible. The c(8 x 8) structure was revealed by STM at room temperature on the same samples. The (4 x 4) patterns have been evidenced to be a manifestation of the c(8 x 8) surface structure in RHEED.

Once established, a STM infestation can quickly increase through the movement of asexual propagules, such as shoot fragments, bulbils and protonema. Many practices used by superintendents are likely aiding in the dispersal and establishment of propagules. Research is needed to help superintendents effectively control this very invasive pest. The objectives of this research were to: 1) Investigate {{the cumulative effect of}} cultivation on a STM infestation in a creeping bentgrass putting green, when used with or without light, frequent topdressing and the herbicide carfentrazone; 2) Determine if STM growth is reduced by spraying ammonium sulfate (AMS) compared to urea, and understand the effect of spray volume on STM growth; 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of a range of carfentrazone rates for postemergence STM control; and 4) Determine if altering the pH of irrigation water with sulfuric- or hydrochloric acid affects the growth of STM. Generally, cultivation and carfentrazone reduced STM cover; however, the greatest reduction in STM cover was achieved when cultivation treatments were used in conjunction with carfentrazone. Topdressing did not affect STM cover. Ammonium sulfate increased STM cover and dry weight compared to urea and an untreated control. Furthermore, spray volume did not affect STM cover at any rating date. Superintendents <b>managing</b> <b>STM</b> infestations should limit or avoid use of AMS as an N source. At 28 days after treatment (DAT) the ED[subscript] 90 (dose required to cause 90 % gametophyte injury) was 26. 8 g ai ha[superscript]- 1, and at 49 DAT ED[subscript] 90 was 54. 3 g ai ha[superscript]- 1; both of these doses are substantially lower than the label rates for long- and short-term control, respectively. As compared with label recommendations, this research suggests lower carfentrazone rates, and longer intervals, may be effective for STM control in putting greens. Irrigation pH affected STM growth, with pH’s 5 and 6 having increased growth compared to pH’s 7 and 8. It was hypothesized a lower irrigation pH enabled STM to better withstand sodium stress...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{compiler}} generation from lambda-calculus definitions is studied. The compiling schemes developed utilize as their object language {{the set of}} state <b>transition</b> machines (<b>STMs)</b> : automata-like <b>transition</b> sets using firstorder arguments. An intermediate definition form, the STM-interpreter, is treated as central to the formulation of STMs. Three compiling schemes are presented: one derived directly from an STM-interpreter for the lambda-calculus; one formulated from an STM-interpreter variant of Landin’s SECD-machine; and one defined through meaning-preserving transformations upon a denotational definition of the lambda-calculus. The results are compared and some tentative conclusions are made regarding the utility of compiler generation with the STM forms. 1...|$|R

With decrease in film thickness delta(0) monotonically decreases, whereas lambda(0) monotonically increases. We observe that Tc, lambda(o) and delta(0) are well described by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory in all films other than the two thinnest ones where we see evidence of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinski (KTB) transition close to Tc.

40|$|Building {{models is}} an {{important}} way of integrating knowledge. Testing and updating models of social-ecological systems can inform management decisions and, ultimately, improve resilience. We report on the outcomes of a six-year, multidisciplinary model development process in the sagebrush steppe, USA. We focused on creating state-and-transition models (STMs), conceptual models of ecosystem change that represent nonlinear dynamics and are being adopted worldwide as tools for <b>managing</b> ecosystems. <b>STM</b> development occurred in four steps with four distinct sets of models: (1) local knowledge elicitation using semistructured interviews; (2) ecological data collection using an observational study; (3) model integration using participatory workshops; and (4) model simplification upon {{review of the literature}} by a multidisciplinary team. We found that different knowledge types are ultimately complementary. Many of the benefits of the STM-building process flowed from the knowledge integration steps, including improved communication, identification of uncertainties, and production of more broadly credible STMs that can be applied in diverse situations. The STM development process also generated hypotheses about sagebrush steppe dynamics that could be tested by future adaptive management and research. We conclude that multidisciplinary development of STMs has great potential for producing credible, useful tools for managing resilience of social-ecological systems. Based on this experience, we outline a streamlined, participatory STM development process that integrates multiple types of knowledge and incorporates adaptive management...|$|R
40|$|The present {{manuscript}} reviews recent scanning tunnelling microscopy (<b>STM)</b> {{studies of}} <b>transition</b> metal (TM) aluminide surfaces. It provides a general {{perspective on the}} contrast between Al atoms and TM atoms in STM imaging. A general trend is the much stronger bias dependence of TM atoms, or TM-rich regions of the surface. This dependence can be attenuated by the local chemical arrangements and environments. Al atoms can show a stronger bias dependence when their chemical environment, such as their immediate subsurface, is populated with TM. All this is well explained in light of combined results of STM and both theoretical and experimental electronic and crystallographic structure determinations. Since STM probes the Fermi surface, the electronic structure {{in the vicinity of}} the Fermi level (EF) is essential for understanding contrast and bias dependence. Hence, partial density of states provides information about the TM d band position and width, s–p–d hybridization or interactions, or charge transfer between constituent elements. In addition, recent developments in STM image simulations are very interesting for elucidating chemical contrast at Al–TM alloy surfaces, and allow direct atomic identification, when the surface does not show too much disorder. Overall, we show that chemically-specific imaging is often possible at these surfaces...|$|R
40|$|For {{over half}} a century, {{inorganic}} Si and III-V materials have led the modern semiconductor industry, expanding to logic transistor and optoelectronic applications. However, these inorganic materials have faced two different fundamental limitations, flexibility for wearable applications and scaling limitation as logic transistors. As a result, the organic and two dimensional have been studied intentionally for various fields. In the present dissertation, three different studies will be presented with followed order; (1) the chemical response of organic semiconductor in NO 2 exposure. (2) The surface and stability of WSe 2 in ambient air. (3) Deposition of dielectric on two dimensional materials using organometallic seeding layer. The organic molecules rely on the van der Waals interaction during growth of thin films, contrast to covalent bond inorganic semiconductors. Therefore, the morphology and electronic property at surface of organic semiconductor in micro scale is more sensitive to change in gaseous conditions. In addition, metal phthalocyanine, {{which is one of}} organic semiconductor materials, change their electronic property as reaction with gaseous analytes, suggesting as potential chemical sensing platforms. In the present part, the growth behavior of metal phthalocyanine and surface response to gaseous condition will be elucidated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In second part, the surface of layered transition metal dichalcogenides and their chemical response to exposure ambient air will be investigated, using <b>STM.</b> Layered <b>transition</b> metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted widespread attention in the scientific community for electronic device applications because improved electrostatic gate control and suppression of short channel leakage resulted from their atomic thin body. To fabricate the transistor based on TMDs, TMDs should be exposed to ambient conditions, while the effect of air exposure has not been understood fully. In this part, the effect of ambient air on TMDs will be investigated and partial oxidation of TMDs. In the last part, uniform deposition of dielectric layers on 2 D materials will be presented, employing organic seedling layer. Although 2 D materials have been expected as next generation semiconductor platform, direct deposition of dielectric is still challenging and induces leakage current commonly, because inertness of their surface resulted from absent of dangling bond. Here, metal phthalocyanine monolayer (ML) is employed as seedling layers and the growth of atomic layer deposition (ALD) dielectric is investigated in each step using STM...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of memory was originally thought to occur through learning causing the {{formation of}} early short-term memory (<b>STM),</b> which <b>transitions</b> into long-term memory (LTM) {{through the process of}} consolidation. Work in Aplysia found that memory consists of three distinct phases that are defined by their unique dependence on protein synthesis. Through altering serotonin exposure, experimenters could selectively generate a translation-independent STM, a translation-dependent intermediate-term memory (ITM), and a transcription- and translation-dependent LTM. Here we specifically examine the memory mechanisms of LTM using neonatal odor preference learning, which is a well-defined, associative mammalian learning and memory model. Within this model a single pairing of the conditioned stimulus (CS) of novel odor exposure with the unconditioned stimulus (US) of the activation of bulbar beta -adrenoceptors within rat pups causes {{the formation of}} a preference for the conditioned odor that lasts for 24 h. Previous analysis of molecular signaling found that odor preference learning increased bulbar cAMP levels and the phosphorylation of CREB. Manipulating the US of beta -adrenoceptor activation causes the alteration of cAMP signaling resulting in the formation or impairment of neonatal odor preference memory such that there is an optimal level of activation, either too little or excessive activation of the US does not produce learning. [...] In the present thesis, we set out to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that produce 24 h neonatal odor preference memory with specific focus on the US of cAMP signaling. In earlier work we had shown, using translational and transcriptional protein synthesis inhibitors, that as in Aplysia, neonatal odor preference memory includes a translation-independent STM lasting till 3 h after learning, a translation-dependent ITM occurring 5 h after learning, and a transcription- and translation-dependent LTM occurring 24 h after learning. Altering the US through decreasing beta -adrenoceptor activation causes the selective generation of ITM, demonstrating the three characteristics of invertebrate memory in mammalian memory (see Appendix). Neonatal odor preference learning causes the activation of bulbar PKA 10 min after training (Chapter 2) and the activation of bulbar ERK immediately after training (Chapter 3). The direct activation of bulbar PKA acts as a sufficient US to selectively generate ITM and LTM and extend odor preference memory to 72 h (Chapter 2). The activation of Epac is also a sufficient US for the generation of long-term neonatal odor preference memory (Chapter 3), demonstrating that cAMP can work through the PKA or Epac/ERK pathway to generate longer protein synthesis-dependent phases of neonatal odor preference memory. Inhibition of either PKA (Chapter 2) or ERK (Chapter 3) prevented the LTM of rat pup odor preference learning with a normal US, suggesting both pathways contribute synergistically to LTM. LTM can be rescued from the inhibition of either bulbar PKA (Chapter 2) or ERK (Chapter 3) through increasing (3 -adrenoceptor activation to a level which normally would not produce learning. Thus higher levels of activation of either pathway alone are sufficient to produce LTM. However, the simultaneous inhibition of both kinases inhibits LTM at any level of beta -adrenoceptor activation tested. PKA (Chapter 2) and Epac (Chapter 3) activation, when given alone, as an intracellular US do not produce STM. Thus ITM and LTM occur independently of STM. In addition a high level of (3 -adrenoceptor activation in the presence of either a PKA (Chapter 2) or ERK (Chapter 3) antagonist does not lead to ITM although LTM is now supported. Thus, while PKA and Epac/ERK synergistically generate normal LTM through odor preference learning, the distinct memory phases of STM, ITM and LTM can occur without the prior occurrence of the temporally earlier memory. Here we have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} PKA and/or Epac activation can act directly as an US for a long-term mammalian memory. In addition, we find that memory is likely composed of parallel intracellular processes which are quasi-independent rather than occurring as a set of serial, interdependent "consolidating" processes...|$|R
