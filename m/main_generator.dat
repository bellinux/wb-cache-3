5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG main and two {{auxiliary}} turbo generators with each driving two dynamos, one each {{for alternating current}} and direct current. Each <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{pairs of}} motors are {{connected}} in series across the <b>main</b> <b>generator.</b> At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the <b>main</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Empire Abercorn {{had four}} <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> and one {{auxiliary}} <b>generator.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> were [...] "Harlandics", built by Harland and Wolff. They were powered by six-cylinder diesel engines of [...] producing 250kW each the auxiliary generator was {{powered by a}} three-cylinder diesel engine of [...] producing 15kW, voltage was 220 volts.|$|R
5000|$|Baltika has a {{diesel-electric}} {{propulsion system}} {{built around the}} power plant principle in which the <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> provide electricity for all shipboard consumers, including the propulsion system. The vessel has three Wärtsilä 9L26 <b>main</b> <b>generators,</b> each producing [...] and capable of running on low sulphur fuel oil.

5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 <b>main</b> <b>generators,</b> each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 <b>main</b> <b>generators,</b> 14 are installed in {{the north side of}} the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100TWh.|$|R

50|$|On September 8, BP {{published}} {{a report that}} suggested that the ignition source was the released gas entering the air intakes of the diesel generators, and engulfing the deck area where the exhaust outlets for the <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> were emitting hot exhaust gas.|$|R
25|$|The {{prime mover}} RPM is {{increased}} and the <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.|$|E
25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the <b>main</b> <b>generator,</b> the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E
25|$|In older locomotives, it was {{necessary}} for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency and to protect the <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} a power-generating dam that holds a {{reservoir}} known as Diablo Lake. At {{the time it was}} completed, Diablo Dam, at 389 feet, was the tallest dam in the world. Water from the dam operates two <b>main</b> <b>generators,</b> each with a capacity of 64.5 MW.|$|R
5|$|The 14 {{north side}} <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> are in operation. The first (No.2) started on July 10, 2003. The north side became {{completely}} operational September 7, 2005 with {{the implementation of}} generator No.9. Full power (9,800MW) was only reached on October 18, 2006 after the water level reached 156m.|$|R

25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the state, near the border with the State of Mexico, is the town of Tlalpujahua. This {{community}} is known for Christmas ornaments that are blown from glass then hand-painted. This craft began after Joaquin Muñoz Orta returned from the United States, where he became familiar with the tradition of using glass balls to decorate trees. They began creating them in Mexico City but returned to his hometown to continue in 1964, where his business grew to make millions of the balls each year, exporting most. Today, the making of ornaments remains the <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> of employment for this area.|$|E
25|$|All {{models have}} chassis and running gear, generator, {{traction}} motors and controls from GE, and Ingersoll Rand provided the diesel engine. The principle of operation {{was the same}} as modern locomotives, the diesel engine driving a <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> of 600volts DC with four axle-hung traction motors. In contrast to the ALCO boxcabs having a design with side doors and ladders the GE boxcabs have front doors and end platforms with steps. The underframe was cast iron. The radiator system was sitting {{on the roof of the}} locomotive. At each locomotive end a GE Model CD65 motor with a Sturtevant multivane fan was pressing air through the radiators.|$|E

The sixth (No.17) began operation on December 18, 2007, raising capacity to 14.1GW, finally surpassing Itaipu (14.0GW), to become the world's largest hydro power plant by capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Electric {{speed and}} load control was {{obtained}} by reducing the <b>main</b> <b>generator's</b> field excitation current coming from the [...] dynamo using a twelve step drum rheostat. The eight traction motors were connected in parallel; for low speed control the motors could be series connected in two sets of four connected in parallel.|$|R
25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new single power lever integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single <b>main</b> <b>generator,</b> which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing field elevation inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E
25|$|While during normal icebreaking {{operations}} each <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> fed its dedicated double-armature electric motor, {{the diesel}} generator supplying the forward propulsion motor {{could also be}} switched to supply electricity to either of the stern motors. In addition, the current {{from any of the}} main generators could be split between the port and starboard propulsion motors with the control of both motors remaining independent from each other. While the stern propulsion motors were built for double torque to overcome the additional loads from propeller-ice interaction, the electric motor driving the forward-facing propeller was dimensioned for a three-fold torque to keep the propeller turning in difficult ice conditions. The nominal speeds of the propulsion motors were 140 rpm in the stern and 160 rpm in the bow.|$|E
25|$|Like the British Class 50s, {{they were}} {{equipped}} with an English Electric 16 CSVT engine and produced 2700hp (2020 HP at the wheels). Unlike the BR locomotives upon which electronic control is extensively used, the Portuguese locomotives employ conventional control gear (the only exceptions being stepless control of tractive effort by a solid-state load regulator {{and the use of}} a very effective out-of-balance wheel-slip detector). The <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> and the traction motors are identical to those used on the BR Type 3 and Deltic locomotives. Contrary to BR Class 50, the Portuguese Série 1800 locomotives were built to be as much compatible with the smaller Série 1400 (themselves similar to BR Class 20) as possible and also to use as many common components as possible.|$|E

25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the <b>main</b> <b>generator)</b> and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E
2500|$|In newer designs {{controlled}} by a “traction computer,” each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or “kW reference”, in software. The computer compares this value with actual <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> power output, or “kW feedback”, calculated from traction motor current and <b>main</b> <b>generator</b> voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the <b>main</b> <b>generator,</b> as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays {{a central role in}} this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a “back-up” in case of engine overload. [...] Modern locomotives fitted with electronic fuel injection (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however a “virtual” load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.|$|E

The main engines are also equipped with exhaust gas economizers. In late 2011 they were also retrofitted with catalytic converters and urea spraying systems to reduce NOx emissions {{in order to meet}} the strict EPA requirements. While designed according to the power plant principle in which the <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> produce power for all shipboard consumers either directly or through a motor-generator, Nordica has one auxiliary diesel generator that can be used to produce electricity when the ship is at port. The four-cylinder Wärtsilä Vasa 4R22 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engine has an output of [...] at 1,000 rpm. In addition she has a twelve-cylinder Caterpillar 3412 DISA emergency diesel generator with an output of [...] at 1,500 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Her two V8 Paxman {{main engines}} each {{had to drive}} a {{generator}} {{in addition to the}} Voith Schneider propellers. Despite also having a third independent generator driven by a 6-cylinder Ruston diesel engine, at times of high electrical demand, the <b>main</b> <b>generators</b> drew around 95bhp from each engine, leaving insufficient power to the propellers, the service speed suffering as a result, particularly in bad weather.|$|R
