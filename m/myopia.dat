5|$|Hyperoxic <b>myopia</b> has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to <b>myopia</b> or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as <b>myopia.</b> Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E
5|$|Henri-Georges Clouzot {{was born}} in Niort, France, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a book store owner. He {{was the first of}} three {{children}} in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. In 1922, Clouzot's father's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest, France, where his father became an auctioneer. In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his <b>myopia.</b> At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. While living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign language films shot there.|$|E
25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with <b>myopia,</b> but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause <b>myopia.</b> Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of <b>myopia,</b> a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of <b>myopia</b> being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of <b>myopia.</b> A collaboration of all <b>myopia</b> studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of <b>myopia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alcohol <b>myopia</b> {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol <b>myopia.</b> This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol <b>myopia</b> to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol <b>myopia</b> tend to feel more committed to their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol <b>myopia.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{literature}} review writes that studies in several nations {{have found a}} relationship between <b>myopia</b> and higher IQ and between <b>myopia</b> and school achievement. Several, but not all, studies have found hyperopia {{to be associated with}} lower IQ and school achievements. A common explanation for <b>myopia</b> is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. One is that the myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more which causes <b>myopia.</b> Another is that the myopic child have an advantage at IQ testing which is near work because of less eye strain. Still another explanation is that pleiotropic gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously. A study of Chinese schoolchildren found that after controlling for age, gender, school, parental <b>myopia,</b> father’s education, and books read per week, <b>myopia</b> was still associated with high nonverbal IQ. Nonverbal IQ was a more important explanation than books read per week.|$|E

25|$|People {{under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol <b>myopia</b> act in a risky manner because of the myopia's inhibiting effects on their ability to analyze the probable outcomes of their actions. Alcohol activates dopaminergic circuits in the midbrain that also regulate the brain's analyzation and recognition of the outcomes of an action. It is not yet clear on exactly how alcohol effects these dopaminergic circuits. The following behaviors are influenced by risk taking when a person is experiencing the effects of alcohol <b>myopia.</b>|$|E

25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol <b>myopia</b> limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to see the world through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol <b>myopia</b> can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E

25|$|Near-sightedness, {{also known}} as {{short-sightedness}} and <b>myopia,</b> is a condition of the eye where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. This causes distant objects to be blurry while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe near-sightedness {{increases the risk of}} retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Water has {{a higher}} {{refractive}} index than air – {{similar to that of}} the cornea of the eye. Light entering the cornea from water is hardly refracted at all, leaving only the eye's crystalline lens to focus light. This leads to very severe hypermetropia. People with severe <b>myopia,</b> therefore, can see better underwater without a mask than normal-sighted people.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the contact}} lens market is likely to grow due to the {{increasing}} occurrence of eye-related conditions such as astigmatism, hypermetropia and <b>myopia.</b> The other drivers are increasing population, the desire to make fashion statements, and technological advancement. By the end of 2020, {{the value of the}} contact lens market is predicted to reach $13.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|Cataract {{extraction}} following {{refractive surgery}} poses special {{problems for the}} patient and the surgeon because the corneal change as a result of refractive surgery complicates accurate keratometry, a key element of lens implant power calculation. After laser refractive surgery for <b>myopia,</b> this could result in overestimation of corneal power, underestimation of the IOL power required, and hyperopic outcomes after cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using corrective lenses. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for <b>myopia</b> a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Horatio's {{siblings}} Olive Augusta and James {{were born}} in 1833 and 1836, respectively. An invalid sister, Annie, was born in 1840, and a brother, Francis, in 1842. Alger was a precocious boy afflicted with <b>myopia</b> and asthma, but Alger, Sr. decided early that his eldest son would one day enter the ministry, and, to that end, he tutored the boy in classical studies and allowed him to observe the responsibilities of ministering to parishioners.|$|E
25|$|LASIK is most {{similar to}} another {{surgical}} corrective procedure, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and both represent advances over radial keratotomy in the surgical treatment of refractive errors of vision. For patients with moderate to high <b>myopia</b> or thin corneas which cannot {{be treated with}} LASIK and PRK, the phakic intraocular lens is an alternative. As of 2011, over 11 million LASIK procedures had been performed in the United States and as of 2009 over 28 million have been performed worldwide.|$|E

In 1960 Theodore Levitt argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The fallacy of the production orientation was also referred to as marketing <b>myopia</b> in an article of the same name by Levitt.|$|E
25|$|When Gaggi {{was a young}} teenager, {{his family}} moved to New Jersey after {{purchasing}} a small farm. When Gaggi turned 17 in 1942, he attempted to join the United States Army, but was rejected due to <b>myopia.</b> In 1943, Gaggi's family left the farm and moved to the Bath Beach area of Brooklyn. Angelo resumed work as a barber while his mother and sister worked in a dress factory. Discharged from the Army due to injury, Roy sold peanut dispensers to bars.|$|E
25|$|Radial keratotomy is a {{refractive}} surgery procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for <b>myopia</b> {{has been largely}} superseded by LASIK and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea. For similar reasons, radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for people with keratoconus.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol <b>myopia</b> on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol <b>myopia.</b> The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
25|$|The American {{scientist}} Benjamin Franklin, {{who suffered}} from both <b>myopia</b> and presbyopia, invented bifocals. Serious historians have {{from time to time}} produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825.|$|E
