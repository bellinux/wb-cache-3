The <b>micro-pile</b> is under plastic state due to its mechanic features. Solid element and ideal elastic-plastic constitutive model of Mohr-Coulomb are applied as the rock and soil mass and pile. The calculation model can work out the safety factor of slope, the dynamic changing process of pile deformation and failure, the failure mode of slope after strengthened by <b>micro-pile.</b> Then the structural element of pile is used to simulate piles, which can obtain the bending moment and shear force.

50|$|During {{construction}} engineers discovered vertical {{movements and}} particularly differential movements ('dishing') between the tower core and the wings. The tower core was sinking {{at a rate}} of 1/2 to 3/4 in per week and the wings were sinking at a slower rate causing differential distortion between the column bays. If these movements were not stopped, severe structural damage would occur and the building would have been at risk of eventual collapse. Construction was halted while a solution was developed and implemented. The solution proved to be the installation of <b>micro-piles</b> (formerly marketed as 'Pin Piles') filled with grout 200 ft deep below the structure each capped with a hydraulic jack to stabilize the structure at the desired vertical height to carry the weight.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Liquefaction is a major concern for bridge column foundations in earthquake prone regions. Although its effects are devastating to the structural integrity of foundations, there is little quantitative information to guide engineers in the design of bridge column pile foundations that may be subjected to liquefaction of the surrounding soil during a seismic event. In order to quantify the effect of liquefaction on the stiffness and damping provided by a pile foundation under the cyclic loading that occurs during a seismic event, a representative foundation often used in bridge design is modeled using linear finite elements. The case study foundation is a 3 x 10 pile group with thirty concrete piles that are each 15 m deep. The effectiveness of a common <b>micro-pile</b> retrofit is also examined through the use of the finite element model. Sixteen 30 m deep micro-piles are added to the perimeter of the 3 x 10 pile group and are connected to the original 3 x 10 pile foundation with an expanded pile cap. These slender piles are comprised of reinforced concrete partially encased with a steel pipe. Loading is applied to the finite element model at frequencies of 0, 2, 4, and 8 Hertz in three directions of translation and two directions of rotation. Liquefaction is simulated in the finite element model by decreasing the elastic modulus of various layers in the model to ten percent and one percent of their original value. The quantitative effects of different loading directions and frequencies are observed when both the retrofitted and non-retrofitted model are subjected to varying degrees of liquefaction at several different soil depths. The information obtained in these simulations is then used to develop stiffness and damping modification factors. This study shows that the effect of retrofitting and of liquefaction on the dynamic behavior of the pile group is highly dependent on load direction, load frequency, and liquefied layer location...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} provides {{theoretical and}} experimental {{support to the}} concept of deliberately seismically under-designing shallow foundations to invoke strong below-ground nonlinearity in the form of rocking, and thereby render RC structures safe under intense seismic excitation. To this end, (I) A series of small-scale (1 -g) and centrifuge tests are conducted investigating the performance of elastic single bridge pier models supported on shallow foundations of different sizes. Static and seismic loading scenarios explore the potential benefits and limitations of under-designed rocking foundations in comparison to conventional alternatives. (II) A validated nonlinear numerical method is developed to provide further insights on the different shallow foundation response mechanisms with emphasis on soil failure. The methodology of Anastasopoulos et al. [2010] is incorporated and extended to account for scale effects in cohesionless soil. (III) For a realistic modelling of the nonlinear response of the superstructure, the novel small-scale physical model of Knappett et al [2011] is utilized and further developed to fabricate 1 : 50 scaled replicas of well-confined modern RC bridge piers. A total of 26 such piers were constructed. The validity of their response was verified by a number of 4 -point bending tests. (IV) Four shaking table centrifuge tests investigate and compare the performance of two RC model bridge piers, having the same structural section in each case, but with two different foundation designs — a conventional design and a rocking isolation design. Each alternative is tested under two different seismic loading scenarios, where the sequence of real ground motions was imposed at the soil model base in such an order as to allow also investigation of the effect of the exact seismic history. (V) To improve rocking isolation design so as to avoid large foundation settlements, an additional set of 9 centrifuge tests (4 static and 5 dynamic) are conducted involving several hybrid foundation schemes. In these schemes the shallow rocking footing is suitably “strengthened” by geometrical modifications or various means of soil improvement: (i) a variable–geometry foundation, whose small rocking stiffness and capacity increase with foundation rotation after some threshold angle; (ii) a rocking-isolated footing standing on top of an appropriately designed “cofferdam”, which provokes uplifting by hindering the formation of bearing capacity failure mechanisms under the footing; (iii) combined densification with a 2 x 2 group of unconnected piles (one under each foundation corner); and (iv) a grid of <b>micro-pile</b> inclusions. The results demonstrate the virtues of rocking-isolation shallow foundations, which stem from: (i) reducing accelerations transmitted onto the deck; (ii) increasing system ductility; (iii) limiting permanent deck drifts; and (iv) increasing resistance against damage accumulation in successive earthquakes. Yet, these tests also highlight the main drawback of rocking isolation. That is, the so called “sinking response”, or in other words the gradual accumulation of settlement caused by strongly inelastic soil behaviour. The four new concepts for improving the performance of rocking foundations that were introduced and tested in this dissertation prove capable of ameliorating this drawback while retaining the benefits of rocking isolation...|$|E
40|$|Sliding slope {{stabilization}} {{can be carried}} out adopting the so-called "reticulated-pile structure". This design solution is also adopted to support high excavations, when no other "traditional" solution is applicable (e. g. anchored diaphragm walls). The soil is reinforced by <b>micro-piles</b> both owing to the formation of a continuous "nucleus" of improved characteristics and by the presence of the piled structure which reacts to the applied loads. The accurate design of the reticulated-pile structure is a very difficult task, owing to its statically indetermination and to the difficulty in the soil-piles interaction analysis. The paper reports a rational approach to design such a structure, already used in many real applications.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of some maintenance works {{for the improvement of}} about 1 km of bank sides at the Lido (Venice), some repairs on the pedestrian and the vehicular bridges on the Excelsior canal were carried out. In particular, the upgrading of the brick masonry arch bridge “Sandro Gallo” is presented in this contribution. The S.

The repairs carried out on the bridge were mainly aimed at upgrading the bridge to the first category, according to the Italian code.

40|$|AbstractSince their {{introduction}} in Europe and North America some 50 years ago, auger cast-in-place piles (ACIP) {{have become}} increasingly popular all over the world. These piles offer considerable environmental advantages during construction including minimal vibration, and low noise beside their high productivity. The most severe limitation of the ACIP is its sensitivity to operator performance, {{which can lead to}} a pile of poor integrity or inconsistent quality. Thus the improper use of ACIP equipment can result in piles containing defects or can cause instability of nearby structures. Three case studies are presented and discussed in an effort to illustrate learned lessons. First case study highlights the misuse of ACIP equipment leading to unreliable defective pile foundations. Second and third case studies show the adverse effects of installing ACIP on the stability of nearby structures. The study revealed that it is essential to employ a clever pile crew during the installation of ACIP to observe, interpret, and take corrective actions for unusual situations. The authorities worldwide should oblige pile contractors to employ only experienced and qualified workers in charge of geotechnical engineering works. Tender documents should include precise clauses related to the technological factors affecting the quality of ACIP. Unfavorable side effects of installing ACIP in saturated loose and medium sand can cause tilt of adjacent existing structures; even they are on either shallow or deep foundations. A row of <b>micro-piles</b> and/or soil grouting adjacent to the existing buildings were successfully used to reduce the adverse effects of ACIP. Implementation of different codes on the results of pile loading tests produced different pile working loads. Therefore tender documents should specify the code upon which interpreting the pile test results. At the meantime the geotechnical engineer should implement his experience and judgment during application of the specified code. Finally this work indicates that the outcome prediction of ACIP may deviate from the actual performance...|$|R
