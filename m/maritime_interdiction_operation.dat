50|$|In 2005, HS-5 {{provided}} two {{aircraft and}} 37 personnel {{to participate in}} the massive Hurricane Katrina relief effort. The Nightdippers logged more than 93.6 flight hours, rescued 41 people in distress and delivered 14,860 pounds of food and water to hurricane victims. Also that summer approximately thirty maintainers, aircrew, and pilots were deployed for six months to an Expanded <b>Maritime</b> <b>Interdiction</b> <b>Operation</b> (EMIO) operating site. The Nightdippers effectively executed the Navy’s EMIO mission operating as part of the maritime component fighting the Global War on Terrorism by deterring, delaying, and disrupting the movement of terrorists and terrorist-related materials at sea. The Nightdippers operated with United States Marine Corps Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST) companies and Mobile Security Squadron Seven (MSS-7), as well as with forces from various allied nations. From January to July 2009, HS-5 deployed in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. Seven months later, HS-5 again deployed aboard Eisenhower and on the first night aboard launched the alert aircraft to conduct a long-range open ocean rescue in perilous weather conditions; the squadron also later recovered three survivors from an E-2C Hawkeye forced to ditch in the North Arabian Sea. In June 2012, HS-5 and CVW-7 deployed with Carrier Strike Group EIGHT (CSG-8) again aboard Eisenhower. Twelve days into the deployment, HS-5 successfully rescued a French Rafale pilot who ejected in the Mediterranean Sea and returned him to the French aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle. HS-5 returned home for two months before deploying again aboard Eisenhower until July 2013. Two months into that second deployment, HS-5 successfully rescued two American Naval Aviators who ejected from their F/A-18F in the Persian Gulf. While deployed the squadron’s homeport officially changed to NS Norfolk, VA in anticipation of the upcoming transition to the MH-60S Seahawk. On January 24, 2014, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Five (HS-5) completed its transition to the MH-60S and was re-designated Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Five (HSC-5) during a ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} team {{collaboration}} was developed that emphasizes cognitive {{aspects of the}} collaboration process and includes the major processes that underlie this type of communication: (1) individual knowledge building, (2) knowledge inter-operability, (3) team shared understanding, and (4) developing team consensus. This paper describes research conducted to validate this model and determine how these processes contribute to team performance by analyzing two collaborative decisionmaking tasks. Team communications that transpired during two complex problem solving situations were analyzed and coded. Data was analyzed for two teams that conducted a <b>Maritime</b> <b>Interdiction</b> <b>Operation</b> (MIO) and four teams that engaged in an air-warfare scenario. The MIO scenario involves a boarding team that boards a suspect ship to search for contraband cargo (e. g. explosives, machinery) and possible terrorist suspects. The air-warfare scenario involves identifying air contacts in the combat information center of an Aegis ship...|$|E
