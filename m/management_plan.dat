5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential <b>management</b> <b>plan.</b> Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the <b>management</b> <b>plan,</b> which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park <b>management</b> <b>plan.</b> The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

30|$|Federal fire <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> are {{essential}} implementation guides {{for the management}} of wildland fire on federal lands. Recent changes in federal fire policy implementation guidance and fire science information suggest the need for substantial changes in federal fire <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> of the United States. Federal land management agencies are also undergoing land <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> efforts that will initiate revision of fire <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> across the country. Using the southern Sierra Nevada as a case study, we briefly describe the underlying framework of fire <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> assess their consistency with guiding principles based on current science information and federal policy guidance, and provide recommendations for the development of future fire <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on our review, we recommend that future fire <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> be: (1) consistent and compatible, (2) collaborative, (3) clear and comprehensive, (4) spatially and temporally scalable, (5) informed by the best available science, and (6) flexible and adaptive. In addition, we identify and describe several strategic guides or “tools” that can enhance these core principles and benefit future fire <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> in the following areas: planning and prioritization, science integration, climate change adaptation, partnerships, monitoring, education and communication, and applied fire management. These principles and tools {{are essential}} to successfully realize fire management goals and objectives in a rapidly changing world.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examined}} {{protected area}} planning processes and planning effectiveness in Victoria, Australia, {{in the period}} 1987 - 2007. The research focussed on <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> documents which set out the management approach and goals, together with a framework for decision making, to apply to a protected area over a given period of time. Protected areas are defined as places {{set aside for the}} long-term conservation of nature and include national parks and other types of reserve. The research questions were: • What are <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> for protected areas? What are they meant to do and how do they do it? • How were protected area <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> prepared in Victoria in the period 1987 to 2007 ? • How do you measure effectiveness in protected area <b>management</b> <b>plans?</b> • How effective were <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> prepared in Victoria in the period 1987 to 2007 ? • Can protected area <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> be made more effective? The research found that there had been little academic discussion on this form of planning and that there was little agreement on how to assess planning effectiveness, so it was necessary to adapt work in related fields including systematic conservation planning, evidence-based conservation, and town and regional planning. The research found that there was significant disagreement in the literature on the appropriate style, process and content of <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Most sources assumed that <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> would be the principal guiding document for management of a particular park but interviews revealed that, at the time in question, annual works programs were determined largely by other management systems. Analysis of <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> and interviews showed that the content and format of <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> changed significantly between 1987 and 1997, the latter plans being shorter and with less resource information and having less park-specific prescriptions due to the introduction of strict editorial guidelines. The research indicated that there was no accepted methodology to measure the effectiveness of protected area <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Therefore work on town and regional planning was adapted to assess plan quality [...] inputs, process and outputsa conformance-based approach and planning effectiveness [...] outcomes [...] a performance-based approach. This new methodology proved to be viable but lengthy and complex. It was limited by the availability and accessibility of information, and the need for specialist evaluation techniques. Considerable resources were devoted to <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> in the period in question but case studies showed that they were inadequate in many respects and were not effective in terms of the criteria developed in this thesis. <b>Management</b> <b>plans</b> were loosing their relevance and were less useful for day-to-day management. The overall conclusion of the thesis was that it is feasible to make protected area planning more effective through better legislation, better integration with local government and other public land planning, more dynamic planning, the use of specific and measurable objectives, providing cost estimates for proposed actions, use of evidence-based planning, development of effective audit and monitoring programs, and the reinstatement of the importance of <b>management</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E
5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species.

A fire <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E
