40|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> we find {{in almost}} every product today are {{implemented}} using integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Developing <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> is a challenging task due to complexity and miniaturization. A single IC can contain billions of transistors, which are smaller than ever. As a result more Design-for-Test (DfT) features, so called instruments, are embedded on-chip in modern ICs to handle and monitor various activities. Many defects are handled at IC manufacturing; however, there are many problems occurring after ICs are being mounted on PCBs. In many cases, it is unfortunately not possible to reproduce the problem when the <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> is taken to a repair shop. These problems are known as No Trouble Found (NTF). One obstacle is the limited access to the on-chip DfT instruments that exist in most ICs.

40|$|For {{advanced}} body related applications, {{there is}} a need of soft, conformable, elastic, mechanical compliant and washable systems. Smart clothes for health monitoring, sport or professional protection need washable and conformable <b>electronic</b> <b>systems,</b> which can be deformed up to 20 %. Implants, like monitoring sensors, or functional implants, need softness, stretchability to comply with the human body, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. Many technologies are already available, like polyimide or PET/PEN based flexible <b>electronic</b> <b>system,</b> or conductive yarns for textile which can be knitted or embroidered to produce textrodes or textile based <b>electronic</b> <b>systems.</b> However softness and interconnections are still problems. Polymers based <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> or stretchable <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> are a possible solution. We have developed several technologies to produce stretchable electronics systems. They are based on the concept of flexible functional islands, onto which standard SMD components are soldered, interconnected with meanders shaped metallic stretchable interconnections. Metallic interconnections are made from copper or gold and are optimized using FEM analysis. Stretchable <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> are then molded in elastomeric (e. g. silicone rubber or polyurethane) matrix. They can sustain at least 100 % of elongation and 3000 cycles at 20 % of elongation. They can be integrated in textile and they are biocompatible and washable...|$|R
