40|$|Solar {{astrometry}} {{deals with}} the accurate measumerent of the solar diameter, and in general with the measurement of {{the shape of the}} Sun. During the last decades several techniques have been developed to monitor the radius and the irradiance of the Sun: <b>meridian</b> <b>transits,</b> <b>telescopes</b> in drift-scan mode, solar astrolabes, balloons, and satellites dedicated to the measurements of the solar diameter, and space measurements of the total solar irradiance are now performed to know the relationship radius-luminosity for the Sun in this evolutionary stage of its life. The feedback of solar astrometry in climate studies is of paramount importance. The status of art in the various fields of research here adressed is outlined. Comment: 8 pages, 1 fig.

5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|R

50|$|The sun transit time, also {{referred}} to as Sun - <b>meridian</b> <b>transit</b> time, is the daily moment when the Sun culminates on the observer's meridian, reaching its highest position in the sky. This solar time is most often used as local noon and therefore will vary with longitude. For example, on April 29, the sun transit time in Boston, Massachusetts is 12:42 p.m., whereas that for New York, New York is 12:53 p.m. This is due to longitudinal distance between the two cities.|$|R
