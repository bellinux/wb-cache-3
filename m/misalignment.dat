5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit <b>misalignment</b> of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit <b>misalignment</b> of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of <b>misalignment.</b> If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for <b>misalignment</b> interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the interactions across current account <b>misalignments,</b> Real Effective Exchange Rate <b>misalignments</b> and financial (or output) gaps within EU countries. We apply panel techniques, including a Bayesian panel VAR, to 27 EU members {{over the period}} 1994 - 2012. We find that, for the euro area, the reaction of current account <b>misalignments</b> to a shock in the Real Effective Exchange Rate <b>misalignments</b> is the largest and the financial gap can influence the current account <b>misalignments</b> more than the output gap. In non-euro area countries and euro periphery an increase in current account <b>misalignments</b> leads to a temporary increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate <b>misalignments,</b> lowering competitiveness and thus amplifying current account fluctuations. For the core, a raise in the rate or {{an expansion of the}} financial gap may help in rebalancing the current account. In the CEE members, an increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate <b>misalignments</b> may bring larger current account deficits in the medium-long run...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on exchange rate <b>misalignments</b> is very extensive {{as well as}} the {{literature on}} exchange rate determinants. To our knowledge, however, no study has analyzed the determinants of exchange rate <b>misalignments.</b> As huge capital inflows have been pouring into emerging countries since the climax of the crisis, exchange rate <b>misalignments</b> are becoming a crucial issue for policy makers. For a large panel of emerging and industrialized countries and on the period 1982 - 2008, we identify, empirically, the main determinants of exchange rate <b>misalignments</b> obtained thanks to a FEER approach (Williamson, 1994). Our analysis put forward trade openness, financial openness and regional specialization as determinant variables of exchange rate <b>misalignments.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or <b>misalignment</b> of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit <b>misalignment</b> of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Don {{failed to}} intensify {{significantly}} {{due to a}} <b>misalignment</b> between the lower and mid-level circulations. The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July28, although the winds increased slightly. Early on July29, Don attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) {{as reported by the}} Hurricane Hunters, and the storm maintained that intensity while moving across the Gulf of Mexico. As Don approached the Texas coast early on July30, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler water temperatures just offshore. The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230UTC on July30. About {{three and a half hours}} later, Don degenerated into a remnant low, and the circulation dissipated six hours after that.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the growth effects of {{real effective exchange rate}} <b>misalignments</b> for the G 20 countries {{over the period}} 1980 - 2006. To this end, we first estimate real effective equilibrium exchange rates relying on the behavioral approach BEER, from which <b>misalignments</b> are derived. Second, we estimate a dynamic panel growth model in which among the traditional determinants of growth, our measure of <b>misalignments</b> is included. Our findings put forward some important differences between developed and emerging economies. The magnitude of the <b>misalignments</b> is more pronounced in the case of emerging countries, and the speed of convergence towards the estimated equilibrium exchange rate is slower for industrialized ones. Turning to our growth regression analysis, we find that <b>misalignments</b> {{have a negative effect on}} the economic growth. As a consequence, an appropriate exchange rate policy would close the gap between real exchange rates and their equilibrium level.

5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the <b>misalignment</b> unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight <b>misalignment</b> of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight <b>misalignment</b> of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} the exchange rate <b>misalignments</b> and the external balance under a pegged currency system focusing on the former French colonies of Africa (the CFA zone). Having discussed and chosen an appropriate analytical framework, it addresses the issue of model uncertainty regarding the equilibrium exchange rate model before estimating currency <b>misalignments.</b> The results show that <b>misalignments</b> have a negative and asymmetric impact on the current account. While overvaluation of the CFA franc deteriorates the current account, undervaluation does not improve it. Finally, our results highlight that the export concentration tends to exacerbate the overall negative impact of currency <b>misalignments...</b>|$|R
40|$|We use a panel data {{methodology}} {{to derive}} a consistent set of both real effective and bilateral exchange rate <b>misalignments</b> for the G 20 currencies. As far as Asia is concerned, two {{conclusions can be}} drawn. First, according to our estimations, the five Asian countries in the sample had strongly undervalued currencies {{at the beginning of}} 2006. Second, a lack of exchange rate adjustment in Asia has limited impact on other <b>misalignments</b> against the US dollar. Indeed, bilateral <b>misalignments</b> between the USA and any other country mainly depend on real effective <b>misalignments</b> of both countries.

40|$|<b>Misalignments</b> always {{occur in}} real optical systems. These <b>misalignments</b> do not {{generate}} new aberration forms, but they change the aberration field dependence. Two-mirror telescopes {{have been used}} in several applications. We analyze a two-mirror telescope configuration that has negligible sensitivity to decenter <b>misalignments.</b> By applying the wave aberration theory for plane-symmetric optical systems it is shown that the asphericity in the secondary mirror, if properly chosen, can compensate for any decenter perturbation allowing third-order coma unchanged across the field of view.

5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the <b>misalignment</b> of the calendar, an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

The alignment and bending functions depend only on properties of the ideal lattice in the absence of errors and steering and have associated expansion amplitudes set by the <b>misalignments</b> and steering fields.
