50|$|Tool and die {{makers are}} {{a class of}} {{machinists}} in the manufacturing industries who <b>make</b> <b>jigs,</b> fixtures, dies, molds, machine tools, cutting tools, gauges, and other tools used in manufacturing processes. Depending on which area of concentration a particular person works in, {{he or she may}} be called by variations on the name, including tool maker (toolmaker), die maker (diemaker), mold maker (moldmaker), tool fitter (toolfitter), etc.|$|E
50|$|Many woodworkers {{prefer to}} <b>make</b> the <b>jig</b> {{in the shop}} in order to {{customize}} it to the particular project at hand.|$|R
40|$|Simple support method <b>makes</b> costly <b>jigs</b> and {{fixtures}} unnecessary. "Dummy" tubes {{installed at}} regular intervals to support "real" tubes before real tubes installed, filled with Cerrobend (or equivalent) material, metallic substance with low melting point, makes dummy tubes rigid so they brace real tubes as installed. When all available spaces for real tubes filled, dummy tubes removed and replaced with real tubes...|$|R
5000|$|Light {{spinning}} and baitcasting tackle {{are used to}} fish for schoolmaster snapper. Live shrimp and baitfish, as well as shrimp pieces and cut bait, are the best natural bait. While <b>jigs</b> <b>make</b> for the best artificial bait, artificials are rarely used and rarely successful.|$|R
40|$|Drill-press jig used {{to remove}} {{improperly}} installed rivets. Drillpress <b>jig</b> <b>makes</b> possible to drill accurately-centered, straight holes through rivets. Key component of jig is a drill bushing with spherical recess machined into base. Contour of recess matches contour of rivet head. Operator holds jig handle {{with one hand}} and controls drill with other. Handle and screw head hold drill bit in place over center of rivet so rivet drilled out through its axis. With rivet removed, parts separated and refastened or reused elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Deep metal {{boxes and}} other parts easily fabricated. Adjustable tooling jig for bending brake {{accommodates}} spacing blocks and either standard male press-brake die or bar die. Holds spacer blocks, press-brake die, bar window die, or combination of three. Typical bending operations include bending of cut metal sheet into box and bending of metal strip into bracket with multiple inward 90 degree bends. By increasing free space available for bending sheet-metal parts <b>jig</b> <b>makes</b> it easier to fabricate such items as deep metal boxes or brackets with right-angle bends...|$|R
40|$|Closed accessThis study {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanical jig for evaluating the ankle joint torque on both cadaver and human ankles. Previous study showed that ankle sprain motion was a combination of plantarflexion and inversion. The device allows measurement of ankle supination and pronation torque with one simple axis in a single step motion. More importantly, the ankle orientation allows rotation starting from an anatomical position. Six cadaveric specimens and six human subjects were tested with simulated and voluntary rotation respectively. The presented mechanical <b>jig</b> <b>makes</b> possible the determination of supination torque for studying ankle sprain injury and the estimation of pronation torque for examining peroneal muscle response...|$|R
50|$|A good, simplistic way to {{summarize}} the change in ideas is to compare {{the making of a}} certain product in different time periods. In 1750, a rifle was made in a workshop by a craftsman using hand tools, and if he needed a new tool, it is likely that he would make it himself using the same tools and methods that he would use to make his product, the rifle (smithy, files, woodcarving knives, etc.) This type of craftsmanship can still be done today, but it is expensive in terms of skilled labor time per unit of output, and therefore it implies small total output volume and high unit price. However, today the way to make rifles in large quantity with low unit price is to first do the tool-and-die work (toolroom work) (that is, make, or have someone else <b>make,</b> machine tools, <b>jigs,</b> and fixtures), and then use those specialized tools to mass-produce the rifles in an automated way that involves no toolroom methods.|$|R
40|$|SW Resources, a {{non-profit}} organization, was contracted to assemble 20, 000 pop nozzle assemblies per day. Most {{of the workers}} at SW Resources have mental or physical disabilities which hinders their ability to assemble the parts correctly. The current assembly process can be performed by most individuals but {{there are problems with}} over tightening of the nozzles and with worker discomfort. The over tightening of the outer casing caused leaks which led to a recall of nearly 400, 000 assemblies. The purpose of this project is to produce a food sanitary assembly <b>jig,</b> <b>make</b> the assembly task more comfortable for the workers, and decrease the reject rate. This report documents the research, design, development, and performance of the assembly jig that is being used by workers with disabilities at SW Resources to assemble hundreds of pop nozzles a day without over tightening and without hurting their hands. BACKGROUND The customer for this project is SW Resources located in Parkersburg, West Virginia. SW is a NISH affiliated, non-profit organization that performs work for both large corporations and local businesses but always aims to increase the opportunities for people with disabilities to be valuabl...|$|R
