[...] He had {{previously}} performed with Ruby Green (Terry Garthwaite), and had recorded Sparking Ragtime & Hardbitten Blues, a now-classic LP, with Green, since released as a CD, so their fans expected they would perform again together.

She had a version of [...] "I'm Goin' Away" [...] where she played guitar at least as well as I did and sang wonderfully. I was of course flattered that someone was so involved with my music and very impressed with how well she handled the material. It turns out that she is the daughter of a Gary Davis disciple named Tom Winslow and apparently she grew up around the Davis' scene and was pretty much brought up in a folk-blues household.She said that I was a primary musical influencefor her, so I've asked her to come and do a guest appearance at the gig,and she said she'd come all the way down from Albany to do it, so it lookslike we'll be hosting Thomasina Winslow on that night, too.

It exists in the centre of a 40 km long monoclinal ridge (Jebel Dihm, Wadi Tayin massif), exposing a full crustal section perpendicular to the spreading direction. New detailed mapping supported by U-Pb zircon geochronology suggests that the active, fast-spreading ridge that died just prior to detachment of the ophiolite is preserved and largely intact. Our observations provide insights into the crystallizing mush zone of a magma chamber, before it crosses the external walls and solidifies as deformed gabbros. Our data provide new constraints on the shape and internal dynamics of a magma chamber, including gabbro subsidence {{from the floor of}} a perched melt lens and the limited contribution of sills to crustal accretion. By locating precisely the palaeo-ridge axis, prior full spreading rate estimates can be increased to ~ 140 km Ma− 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{computer}} vision {{is concerned with}} extracting information from images. The task of image segmentation {{is a first step}} in many computer vision methods and serves to simplify the problem by grouping the pixels in the image in logical ways. Image segmentation is hard to clearly define because there are many levels of detail in an image and therefore many possible ways of meaningfully grouping pixels. Additionally, after choosing a definition for an optimal segmentation, there are many computational difficulties in finding such a segmentation. This thesis presents three different ways to approach image segmentation, explain an efficient implementation for each approach, and show sample segmentations results. ivv Acknowledgements I would like to thank Daniel Scharstein for advising me on my thesis despite that he was on leave for the semester.
