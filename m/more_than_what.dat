5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> ritual is represented.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> {{the author of the}} story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E

Overall, {{at the end of}} the first season, it was reported that the ISL drew a total of 429 million viewers across India, just a bit lower than the Pro Kabaddi League, and two and a half times more than the FIFA World Cup. It was also reported that 57% of the viewers were women and children and that the STAR Sports website gained 32 million visits during the tournament.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of stoppage, the {{scorecards}} read 89–81, 89–82, and 87–83, all in favour of Mayweather.

25|$|In July 1921, a {{cease-fire}} was agreed and negotiations between delegations of the Irish and British sides produced the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

25|$|Using {{deuterium-tritium}} fuel, {{the resulting}} energy barrier is about 0.1MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen is 13.6eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) {{result of the}} fusion is an unstable 5He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining 4He nucleus is 3.5MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6MeV.

25|$|Information about tariffs at water kiosks is contradictory.

25|$|Non-revenue {{water has}} been {{estimated}} at being higher than 65%. Currently, service providers produce 41,720 liters per second (LPS), which is an average of 907 liters per person and day (LPPD) before losses.

25|$|In 2000, a {{wind farm}} of 17 {{turbines}} was erected {{at the western}} cape. It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year. This is much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland Anatolia through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view.
