5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>method</b> that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E

25|$|While {{outwardly}} {{very similar}} to the armet, the close helmet had an entirely different method of opening. Like the armet, the close helmet followed the contours {{of the head and neck}} closely, and narrowed at the throat, therefore it required a <b>mechanical</b> <b>method</b> for opening and closing. While an armet opened laterally using two large hinged cheekpieces, a close helmet instead opened vertically via an integral rotating bevor, which was attached to the same pivots as its visor. The moving parts were usually secured when closed by pivot-hooks engaging pierced staples. Alternatively, spring-loaded studs could be employed. The bevor was often held closed by a strap.|$|E
25|$|When a {{prolonged}} agricultural crisis and economic slump after the Napoleonic Wars threatened to cripple the entire educational reform programme, {{the government had}} to resort to a distressingly <b>mechanical</b> <b>method</b> of education, the so-called Bell-Lancaster method imported from the industrial north of England, which reduced the number of teachers by a drastic simplification of the curriculum to enable preposterously large numbers of pupils to be taught by a single individual. After some years, this method provoked increasing opposition from parents, who wanted more liberal and inspiring forms of education. Their demands received vigorous support from the poet-clergyman N. F. S. Grundtvig, who exercised a powerful influence on the development of Danish schools. Grundtvig wanted to reduce the task of children's schools to no more than the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in order to make room, either at home or at school, for a liberal narrative education that would build on the natural potential for development inherent in the child's mind.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the <b>mechanical</b> <b>method</b> of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims—A {{randomised}} controlled {{comparison of}} haemostatic efficacy of mechanical, injection, and thermal methods of haemostasis was undertaken using canine mesenteric vessels {{to test the}} hypothesis that <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> of haemostasis are more effective in controlling haemorrhage than injection or thermal methods. The diameter of arteries in human bleeding ulcers measures up to 3. 45 mm; mesenteric vessels up to 5 mm were therefore studied.  Methods—Mesenteric vessels were randomised to treatment with injection sclerotherapy (adrenaline and ethanolamine), bipolar diathermy, or <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> (band, clips, sewing machine, endoloops). The vessels were severed and haemostasis recorded.  Results—Injection sclerotherapy and clips failed to stop bleeding from vessels of 1 mm (n= 20) and 2 mm (n= 20). Bipolar diathermy was effective on 8 / 10 vessels of 2 mm but failed on 3 mm vessels (n= 5). Unstretched elastic bands succeeded on 13 / 15 vessels of 2 mm but on only 3 / 10 vessels of 3 mm. The sewing machine achieved haemostasis on 8 / 10 vessels of 4 mm but failed on 5 mm vessels (n= 5); endoloops were effective on all 5 mm vessels (n= 5).  Conclusions—Only <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> were effective on vessels greater than 2 mm in diameter. Some <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> (banding and clips) were less effective than expected and need modification. Thermal and (effective) <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> were significantly (p< 0. 01) more effective than injection sclerotherapy.

OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effects of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment, prostaglandins (vaginal and intracervical prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), misoprostol) and oxytocin.

A comparison with amniotomy will be added, should this comparison be made in future trials. Different types of intervention have been considered as mechanical methods: (1) introduction of laminaria tents, or their synthetic equivalent (Dilapan), into the cervical canal; (2) the introduction of a catheter through the cervix into the extra-amniotic space, with or without traction; (3) use of a catheter to inject fluidsin the extra-amniotic spaceIn addition, we made other comparisons: (1) specific <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> (balloon catheter and laminaria tents) compared with any prostaglandins or with oxytocin; (2) addition of prostaglandins or oxytocin to <b>mechanical</b> <b>methods</b> compared with prostaglandins alone.

MAIN RESULTS: For this update we have included a further 27 studies. The review includes 71 randomised controlled trials (total of 9722 women), ranging from 39 to 588 women per study.
