In the boundary layer (0 – 1. 4 km), maritime air masses, advected over the forest by southeasterly trade winds, were measured at various distances from the coast. Since the organohalogens presented here have relatively long atmospheric lifetimes (0. 4 – 1. 0 years) {{in comparison to the}} advection times from the coast (1 – 2 days), emissions will accumulate in air traversing the rainforest.

40|$|Although {{there are}} many chlorine-containing trace gases in the atmosphere, only those with {{atmospheric}} lifetimes of 2 years or fewer appear to have significant natural sources. The most abundant of these gases are <b>methyl</b> chloride, <b>chloroform,</b> dichloromethane, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene. Methyl chloride represents about 540 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) Cl, while the others together amount to about 120 pptv Cl. For <b>methyl</b> chloride and <b>chloroform,</b> both oceanic and land-based natural emissions have been identified. For the other gases, {{there is evidence of}} oceanic emissions, but the roles of the soils and land are not known and have not been studied. The global annual emission rates from the oceans are estimated to be 460 Gg Cl/yr for CH₃Cl, 320 Gg Cl/yr for CHCl₃, 160 Gg Cl/yr for CH 2 Cl 2, and about 20 Gg Cl/yr for each of C₂HCl₃, and C₂Cl₄. Land-based emissions are estimated to be 100 Gg Cl/yr for CH 3 Cl and 200 Gg Cl/yr for CHCl 3. These results suggest that the oceans account for about 12 % of the global annual emissions of methyl chloride, although until now oceans were thought to be the major source.

5000|$|Ozone can {{be harmful}} {{if it is}} ground-level, {{but if it is}} in the stratosphere, it protects the Earth from {{ultraviolet}} rays from the sun. The stratosphere blocks some of the light called ultraviolet B, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage. It can also damage plant life on land and in the ocean. Some of the main pollutants that are harmful to the stratosphere are called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). They come from aerosols such as hairspray, air conditioners, and some other types. They were banned in the 1970s. In the 1980s, scientists found that there were holes in the ozone around the South Pole. As a result, over 190 countries, including the United States, signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This agreement is designated to eliminating chemicals that harm the stratosphere.

50|$|The {{hydroxyl}} •OH radical {{is one of}} {{the main}} chemical species controlling the oxidizing capacity of the global Earth atmosphere. This oxidizing reactive species has a major impact on the concentrations and distribution of greenhouse gases and pollutants in the Earth atmosphere. It is the most widespread oxidizer in the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere. Understanding •OH variability is important to evaluating human impacts on the atmosphere and climate. The •OH species has a lifetime in the Earth atmosphere of less than one second. Understanding the role of •OH in the oxidation process of methane (CH4) present in the atmosphere to first carbon monoxide (CO) and then carbon dioxide (CO2) is important for assessing the residence time of this greenhouse gas, the overall carbon budget of the troposphere, and its influence on the process of global warming. The lifetime of •OH radicals in the Earth atmosphere is very short, therefore •OH concentrations in the air are very low and very sensitive techniques are required for its direct detection. Global average hydroxyl radical concentrations have been measured indirectly by analyzing <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> (CH3CCl3) present in the air. The results obtained by Montzka et al. (2011) shows that the interannual variability in •OH estimated from CH3CCl3 measurements is small, indicating that global •OH is generally well buffered against perturbations. This small variability is consistent with measurements of methane and other trace gases primarily oxidized by •OH, as well as global photochemical model calculations.|$|E

The distributions of methyl chloride, <b>methyl</b> bromide and <b>chloroform</b> were analyzed as a function of forest contact time and the respective relationship used to determine fluxes from the rainforest during the long dry season. Emission fluxes have been calculated for <b>methyl</b> chloride and <b>chloroform</b> as 9. 4 (± 4. 0 2 s) and 0. 34 (0. 14 ± 2 s) µg m - 2 h - 1, respectively. No significant flux from the rainforest was observed for methyl bromide within the limits of these measurements. The flux of methyl chloride was in general agreement with the flux measured over the same region in March 1998 during the LBA Claire project using a different analytical system. This confirms that the rainforest is a strong source for methyl chloride and suggests that this emission is relatively uniform throughout the year. In contrast the chloroform flux derived here is a factor of three less than previous measurements made in March 1998 suggesting a pronounced ecosystem variation. The differences in chloroform fluxes could not be attributed to either temperature or rainfall changes. The global extrapolation of the derived fluxes led to 1. 5 (± 0. 6 2 s) Tg yr - 1 for methyl chloride, which is in the range of the missing source postulated by previous model studies and 55 (± 22 2 s) Gg yr - 1 for chloroform...|$|R

Methyl iodide emissions from rice plants grown in soils were observed to be significantly lower than reported from rice paddies in the literature, suggesting that the growth conditions contribute to the production of methyl iodide...|$|R
40|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{emissions}} of <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> (1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane) {{resulting from the}} Montreal Protocol provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve {{our understanding of the}} oxidizing power of EarthÕs atmosphere. Atmospheric observations of this industrial gas during the late 1990 s yield new insights into the global burden and distribution of the hydroxyl radical. Our results set Þrm upper limits on the global and Southern Hemispheric lifetimes of <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> and conÞrm the predominance of hydroxyl in the tropics. Our analysis suggests a global lifetime for <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> of 5. 2 (10. 2, 20. 3) years, a Southern Hemispheric lifetime of 4. 9 (10. 2, 20. 3) years, and mean annual concentrations of OH that are 15 6 10 % higher south of the intertropical convergence zone than those north of this natural mixing bound-ary between the hemispheres.

40|$|Billions of tons {{natural and}} {{anthropogenic}} gases are released and subsequently {{removed from the}} troposphere each year. Photochemical reactions, initiated by hydroxyl (OH) radicals, oxidise most gases to products which are more easily removed by precipitation and dry deposition at the Earth's surface. Since human-induced pollution emissions strongly affect OH formation and loss, large global changes in OH concentrations are possible. The available evidence as reviewed here, however, indicates that global mean OH has changed relatively little in the past century. Depletion of OH by reactive carbon gases has been compensated by increased OH formation by nitrogen oxides, an act of &quot;inadvertent geo-engineering&quot;. Analyses of global mean OH for the past 2. 5 decades, however, partly based on <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> measurements, are ambiguous. Especially the OH trend in the 1990 s based on these analyses {{is at odds with}} present understanding. Since the discrepancy is dominated by the uncertainty in <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> emission estimates, improvements of source inventories and model analyses, combined with continued high precision <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> measurements, will help resolve this problem...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{purified}} {{samples of}} the two chlorocarbons, trichloroethane and <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform,</b> were reacted with OH over the temperature range of 278 to 460 K in a discharge-flow system with resonance flourescence detection of OH. Attention {{is given to the}} data obtained at various temperature levels and to the graph of Arrhenius' diagram. It is determined that the <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroform</b> reaction was slower and its temperature dependence somewhat steeper than the earlier measurements had indicated, probably due to the presence of faster reacting olefinic impurities in prior studies. Implications for stratospheric ozone reductions by C 10 -sub-x catalysis and for tropospheric OH-budget are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanism}} of transport and distribution of volatile organic compounds in blood. Studies were conducted on five typical organic solvents to investigate how these compounds are transported and distributed in blood. Groups of four to five rats were exposed for 2 hr to 500 ppm of n-hexane, toluene, <b>chloroform,</b> <b>methyl</b> isobutyl ketone (MIBK), or diethyl ether vapor; 94, 66, 90, 51, or 49 %, respectively, of these solvents in the blood were found in the red blood cells (RBCs). Very similar results were obtained in vitro when aqueous solutions of these solvents were added to rat blood. In vitro studies were also conducted on human blood with these solvents; 66, 43, 65, 49, or 46 %, respectively, of the added solvent was taken up by the RBCs. These results indicate that RBCs from humans and rats exhibited substantial differences in affinity for the three more hydrophobic solvents studied. When solutions of these solvents were added to human plasma and RBC samples, large fractions (51 - 96 %) of the solvents were recovered from ammonium sulfate-precipitated plasma proteins and hemoglobin. Smaller fractions were recovered from plasma water and red cell water. Less than 10 % of each of the added solvents in RBC samples was found in the red cell membrane ghosts. These results indicate that RBCs {{play an important role in}} the uptake and transport of these solvents. Proteins, chiefly hemoglobin, are the major carriers of these compounds in blood. It can be inferred from the results of the present study that volatile lipophilic organic solvents are probably taken up by the hydrophobic sites of blood proteins...|$|R
40|$|Washed excised {{roots of}} rice (Oryza sativa) {{produced}} H 2, CH 4 and fatty acids (millimolar concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate; micromolar concentrations of isovalerate, valerate) when incubated under anoxic conditions. Surface sterilization {{of the root}} material resulted in the inactivation of the production of CH 4, a strong reduction of the production of fatty acids and a transient (75 h) but complete inhibition of the production of H 2. Radioactive bicarbonate was incorporated into CH 4, acetate, propionate and butyrate. About 20 ^ 40 % of the fatty acid carbon originated from CO 2 reduction. In the presence of phosphate, CH 4 was exclusively produced from H 2 /CO 2, since phosphate selectively inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis. Acetoclastic methanogenesis was also selectively inhibited by <b>methyl</b> fluoride, while <b>chloroform</b> or 2 -bromoethane sulfonate inhibited CH 4 production completely. Production of CH 4, acetate, propionate and butyrate from H 2 /CO 2 was always exergonic with Gibbs free energies 6320 kJ mol 31 product. Chloroform inhibited the production of acetate and the incorporation of radioactive CO 2 into acetate. Simultaneously, H 2 was no longer consumed and accumulated, indicating that acetate was produced from H 2 /CO 2. Chloroform also resulted in increased production of propionate and butyrate whose formation from CO 2 became more exergonic upon addition of chloroform. Nevertheless, the incorporation of radioactive CO 2 into propionate and butyrate was inhibited by chloroform. The accumulation of propionate and butyrate {{in the presence of}} chloroform probably occurred by fermentation of organic matter, rather than by reduction of acetate and CO 2. [U- 14 C]Glucose was indeed converted to acetate, propionate, butyrate, CO 2 and CH 4. Radioactive acetate, CO 2 and CH 4 were also products of the degradation of [U- 14 C]cellulose and [U- 14 C]xylose...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{describing}} the complete oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to sulfate by an anoxygenic, phototrophic purple sulfur bacterium. Complete DMS oxidation was observed in cultures of Thiocapsa roseopersicina M 11 incubated under oxic/light conditions, resulting in a yield of 30. 1 mg protein mmol– 1. No oxidation of DMS occurred under anoxic/light conditions. <b>Chloroform,</b> <b>methyl</b> butyl ether, and 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole, which are specific inhibitors of aerobic DMS oxidation in thiobacilli and hyphomicrobia, did not affect DMS oxidation in strain M 11. This {{could be due to}} limited transport of the inhibitors through the cell membrane. The growth yield on sulfide as sole electron donor was 22. 2 mg protein mmol– 1 under anoxic/light conditions. Since aerobic respiration of sulfide would have resulted in yields lower than 22 mg protein mmol– 1, the higher yield on DMS under oxic/light conditions suggests that the methyl groups of DMS have served as an additional carbon source or as an electron donor in addition to the sulfide moiety. The kinetic parameters Vmax and Km for DMS oxidation under oxic/light conditions were 12. 4 ± 1. 3 nmol (mg protein) – 1 min– 1 and 2 µM, respectively. T. roseopersicina M 11 also produced DMS by cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Specific DMSP cleavage rates increased with increasing initial substrate concentrations, suggesting that DMSP lyase was only partly induced at lower initial DMSP concentrations. A comparison of T. roseopersicina strains revealed that only strain M 11 was able to oxidize DMS and cleave DMSP. Both strain M 11 and strain 5811 accumulated DMSP intracellularly during growth, while strain 1711 showed neither of these characteristics. Phylogenetic comparison based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence revealed a similarity of 99. 0 % between strain M 11 and strain 5811, and 97. 6 % between strain M 11 and strain 1711. DMS and DMSP utilization thus appear to be strain-specific. ...|$|R
