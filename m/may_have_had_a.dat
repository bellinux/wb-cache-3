5|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{morphology}} of the mandibles, scientists {{have suggested that}} Brownimecia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> high level of feeding specialization.|$|E
5|$|In 1311–1312, a {{rebellion}} in Kraków instigated by the city's patrician leadership seeking rule by the House of Luxembourg was put down. This event <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> limiting {{impact on the}} emerging political power of towns.|$|E
5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|Weierstrass <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{illegitimate child}} named Franz with {{the widow of}} his friend Carl Wilhelm Borchardt.|$|R
50|$|According to some scholars, {{the salt}} water now {{covering}} this site <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{effect on the}} accuracy of the carbon dating.|$|R
50|$|Nine {{academic}} freedom bills were proposed in various state legislatures in 2011. The effort {{to repeal the}} Louisiana Science Education Act <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect in dampening the pressure to pass those bills.|$|R
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E
5|$|The family Trogloraptoridae <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wider {{distribution}} {{given that}} redwood forests encompassed {{a far greater}} area in North America during the Pliocene (about 5 mya). Other species may still be present in other caves.|$|E
5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads. It is thought that the occupant <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> close connection with the woman in the bed burial– perhaps a relative or a lady-in-waiting who was buried with her mistress.|$|E
5|$|Heather Weather (Thompson) is {{the weather}} {{reporter}} for the local TV news. She battles Corrinda for the spotlight. She is suspected of the murder when Marilyn learns Heather <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> affair with Larry.|$|R
5|$|Polyphonic music {{written for}} the monks of Christ Church Priory (the cathedral) survives from the 13th century. The cathedral <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> organ {{as early as the}} 12th century, though the names of organists are only {{recorded}} from the early 15th century.|$|R
500|$|A figure named Æsc (Old English [...] "ash tree") {{appears as}} the son of Hengest in the Anglo-Saxon {{genealogy}} for the kings of Kent. This <b>has</b> resulted in <b>a</b> number of theories that the figures <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> earlier basis in pre-Norse Germanic mythology.|$|R
5|$|After the Roman {{conquest of}} Britain in the 1st centuryAD, Maiden Castle {{appears to have}} been abandoned, {{although}} the Romans <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> military presence on the site. In the late 4th centuryAD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th centuryAD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered Species Act protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E
5|$|The list on {{the left}} recounts the actions and {{operations}} undertaken by the squadrons operating in the Adriatic during the campaign. The list on the right provides contextual information, recounting wider events in Europe and the Mediterranean that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect on the campaign.|$|R
50|$|Due to declining sea {{temperatures}} {{in the area that}} Angolasaurus inhabited, as well as the later Bientiaba locality, it <b>has</b> been hypothesized that it and the other mosasaurs inhabiting its region <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> increased coverage of dark patterning on its dorsal surface to aid in thermoregulation.|$|R
50|$|According to tradition, {{during his}} youth he shared the {{education}} of a royal prince who afterwards became King of Edessa, perhaps Abgar X bar Manu (ruled Osroene 202-217). He is said to <b>have</b> converted the prince to Christianity, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> important share in Christianizing the city.|$|R
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating that it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more favourable climate), {{but the lack of}} pollen may be the product of a deeper lake. Polylepis may have thrived in favourable salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena pollen is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{conclusions}} {{of the study was}} that the people buried in Lindow Moss <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> less varied diet than their European counterparts. According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age collection at the British Museum, the importance of Lindow Man lies more in how he lived rather than how he died, as the circumstances surrounding his demise may never be fully established.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Bátaapáti, in Tolna County, which was mainly {{inhabited}} by Germans. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect on his choice of musical instruments as the harp was very popular with the German people in his community. Many wanderer harpists lived in the counties south of Lake Balaton.|$|R
40|$|Management {{measures}} {{directed at}} limiting fishing effort <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{influence on the}} behaviour of the beam trawl fleet that negatively affected the North Sea plaice and sole stocks. This study analyses trends in fleet behaviour and fishing pressure in relation to management measures proposed by the fishing industry...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the horns, Syndyoceras also possessed tusk-like canine teeth, that it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> used to root through soil and undergrowth for food, {{in a similar manner}} to a modern musk deer. The shape of the skull also suggests that it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> inflated muzzle, like that of a modern saiga.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> potentially negative effect on interest in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|The one-child {{policy of}} China {{made it more}} {{expensive}} for parents with children to adopt, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect upon the numbers of children living in state-sponsored orphanages. However, in the 1980s and early 1990s, poor care and high mortality rates in some state institutions generated intense international pressure for reform.|$|R
50|$|Each spring {{since its}} {{founding}} in 1977, Memphis in <b>May</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant economic and educational impact to the city. The celebration includes a diverse mix of events, beginning during the first weekend of the month at Tom Lee Park on the Mississippi River, the site of the Beale Street Music Festival.|$|R
50|$|During the 16th century lusterweibchen boomed, with famous designs {{by artists}} such as Albrecht Dürer, Veit Stoss, and Tilman Riemenschneider. Lusterweibchen chandeliers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> almost magical appeal. {{reflecting}} {{the spirit of the}} era. The most famous lusterweibchen design was a dragon chandelier carved according to a drawing by Albrecht Dürer.|$|R
5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria {{in the last years}} of the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused {{a dramatic change}} in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
25|$|Two {{independent}} evolutionary {{analyses of}} the peroxisomal proteome found homologies between the peroxisomal import machinery and the ERAD pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum, along {{with a number of}} metabolic enzymes that were likely recruited from the mitochondria. Recently, it <b>has</b> been suggested that the peroxisome <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> actinobacterial origin, however, this is controversial.|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{reduction}} of percentage peak uptake in the segments of accelerated sestamibi clearance showed a trend of being {{higher than that}} in normal perfusion segments. However, this was not significant. Since tracer decay might <b>have</b> impacts on the percentage peak uptake, this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> influence on the relative uptake analysis.|$|R
50|$|Antinomianism or Grindletonianism <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{influence}} on Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643).|$|R
