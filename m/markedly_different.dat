5|$|Ishaan's {{situation}} changes {{when a new}} art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, {{joins the}} school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are <b>markedly</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E

50|$|Jamón serrano: (also {{known as}} jamón reserva, jamón curado and jamón extra): “ordinary cured ham” from white pigs, fed with a mixed diet of {{authorized}} commercial compound feed. The words serrano, curado, reserva and extra are just marketing terms {{and do not}} reliably indicate quality, which can differ <b>markedly</b> between <b>different</b> brands and {{is not easy to}} recognize. Price may be a good indication. It has TSG status.|$|R
5|$|The Sugar Bowl eruptive {{period was}} short and <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It {{produced}} the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.|$|E
5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E

The quality and diversity {{of all of these}} vary <b>markedly</b> between <b>different</b> balls. While all claim to offer luxury (and many deliver), some have distinctive hallmarks: Peterhouse is famed for its ferris wheel, Magdalene for its dining, Trinity for its exceptional fireworks and flame display, Clare for its entertainment lineup and St John's and Robinson for its party atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Variations are <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> {{with each}} {{subspecies}}. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Within the genus, the yellow-tailed {{and the two}} Western Australian white-tailed species, the short-billed and long-billed black cockatoo, {{form the}} {{subgenus}} Zanda. The red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos form the other subgenus, Calyptorhynchus. The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile food begging calls {{and the degree of}} sexual dimorphism. Males and females of the latter group have <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from that of its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1.

30|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} such as β-lactams {{are appropriate}} first-line therapy for most patients. A proportion of H. influenzae isolates produce β-lactamase (this varies <b>markedly</b> between <b>different</b> locations) {{and in this}} circumstance, extended spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulinic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolide antibiotics are appropriate therapeutic choices. In Spain and Japan, β-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains are prevalent. These BLNAR strains {{are associated with a}} high incidence of pneumonia [68, 69]. For hospitalized patients particularly if there is associated respiratory failure the parenteral route of administration may be preferred.|$|R
40|$|A very {{striking}} {{feature of}} medicine is that prevalence of diseases varies <b>markedly</b> in <b>different</b> populations around the globe.

5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E

In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Human {{subjects}} {{were instructed to}} point one hand to different visual targets which were randomly sequenced, using a paradigm which allowed {{two degrees of freedom}} (shoulder, elbow). The time course of the hand trajectory and the joint angular curves were observed. The latter exhibited patterns which change <b>markedly</b> for <b>different</b> movements, whereas the former preserve similar characteristics (in particular, a single peaked tangential velocity curve). The hypothesis is then formulated that the central command for these movements is formulated in terms of trajectories of the hand in space...|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery {{published}} {{the results of}} their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A full new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Australian botanist Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B.subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.ericifolia is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E

Such behavior is found to be consistent with a sticky-price model with backward-looking agents. Sticky information model finds less support. Finally, such behavior of prices is not consistent with forward-looking agents or exible prices. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variation}} in the mercury levels found in mackerel. These levels differ <b>markedly</b> for <b>different</b> species, and even for the same species in different locations; however, the strongest positive correlation seems {{to be connected to}} the species' size (the larger species being higher on the food chain). According to the United States Food and Drug Administration, king mackerel is one of four fishes, along with swordfish, shark, and tilefish, that children and pregnant women should avoid due to high levels of methylmercury found in these fish and the consequent risk of mercury poisoning.|$|R
40|$|A natural {{experiment}} in the Russian real estate markets is used to test different theories of price formation.

In cities, in which prices were quoted in Russian rubles, their dollar-equivalents fell sharply together with the exchange rate, stayed low {{for two to three}} years, and then recovered rapidly when economy picked up. Such behavior is found to be consistent only with a sticky-price model with backward-looking agents. Models based on forward-looking agents and sticky information do not find support...|$|R
5|$|The Grey Cup is the {{championship}} of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the trophy {{awarded to the}} victorious team. The trophy is named after Albert Grey, the Governor General of Canada from 1904 until 1911. He donated the trophy to the Canadian Rugby Union in 1909 to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. By this time Canadian football had become <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the rugby football from which it developed. Although it was originally intended to be awarded only to amateur teams (like the Stanley Cup), over time, the Grey Cup became {{the property of the}} Canadian Football League as it evolved into a professional football league. Amateur teams ceased competing for the Cup by 1954; since 1965, the top amateur teams, playing in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), have competed for the Vanier Cup.|$|E

(It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — <b>markedly</b> <b>different</b> from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in the New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations, was <b>markedly</b> <b>different.</b> They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies and the historical records of the early colonizers. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak {{when compared to the}} statistically led investigations in Europe.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{identity}} of motor neurons diverges <b>markedly</b> at <b>different</b> rostrocaudal {{levels of the}} spinal cord, but the signals that specify their fate remain poorly defined. We show that retinoid receptor activation in newly generated spinal motor neurons has {{a crucial role in}} specifying motor neuron columnar subtypes. Blockade of retinoid receptor signaling in brachial motor neurons inhibits lateral motor column differentiation and converts many of these neurons to thoracic columnar subtypes. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active retinoid receptor derivative impairs the differentiation of thoracic motor neuron columnar subtypes. These findings provide evidence for a regionally restricted role for retinoid signaling in the postmitotic specification of motor neuron columnar identity...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{progress}} made in Civil Rights since the 1960 s {{there are still}} huge wage disparities {{between black and white}} workers in America. In new research that examines wage disparities in metropolitan areas in the U. S., Craig Kerr finds that the idea of a national wage gap is misleading. Instead, he argues that wage disparities often differ <b>markedly</b> between <b>different</b> cities and regions due to factors that include black population numbers, workplace discrimination, union membership, segregation, and incarceration rates. With this in mind, he writes that policies aimed at reducing wage inequalities should be targeted at specific areas, rather than using a one size fits all approach...|$|R
40|$|It {{is evident}} that the pores of the nuclear {{envelope}} function as pathways for macromolecular exchanges between the nucleus and cytoplasm (1, 2). It is of interest, therefore, that the total pore area varies <b>markedly</b> in <b>different</b> cell types (3), as does the ultrastructure of the electron-opaque annular material associated with the pores (4). It has proven difficult, however, to determine {{the relative importance of}} these structural variations in controlling the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope.
