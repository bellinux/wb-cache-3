40|$|Abstract—We {{have applied}} the phase unwrapping {{technique}} {{to resolve the}} phase ambiguity problem arising from complex expressions of scattering parameters, for reflection-only <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations,</b> since, at some instances, only {{one side of the}} sample under test is accessible for electromagnetic measurements. We considered two different <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations</b> for testing the applicability of the phase unwrapping technique as: 1) two identical samples with different lengths flushed by a short-circuit termination and 2) one sample shorted by a varying short-circuit termination. For each <b>measurement</b> <b>configuration,</b> the underlying expressions for the reflection scattering parameters are derived. For both cases, we evaluated the suitability of the phase unwrapping technique by considering a highly-dispersive medium (distilled water) as our test sample. We note that continuity of the real part of the complex wavelength is a key issue in the unwrapping technique for (one-port) reflection-only measurements. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} dynamic {{positioning}} {{to function in}} ice-infested waters is growing as the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} enters the Arctic. The ice introduces great challenges, some of which can be resolved through proper ice management. This requires good knowledge of the surrounding ice-environment. This thesis deals with the question of achieving a good state estimator for a sea-ice model. The dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model of Hilber III (1979) is implemented, and it is shown through simulations that it reacts in a realistic manner to varying air temperature. The states of this model are estimated with an ensemble Kalman filter, and it is shown that different states can be estimated very well by ensemble Kalman filters based on different <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations.</b> This implemented nonlinear sea-ice model and state estimator is meant to serve as a platform where methods designed to select <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations</b> best suited for state estimation can be tested. A suggestion for a method which chooses <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations</b> on-line is presented. The idea is that this method allows for different <b>measurement</b> <b>configurations</b> to be applied at different time steps, all based on which one that provides the best estimate at the current time. Unfortunately {{there was no time to}} implement this method and test it on the previously mentioned test platform; it must be kept in mind that it is merely a theoretical suggestion which must be further tested. </p...|$|R
