5000|$|Inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, also {{referred}} to as <b>mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> (ML II), is part of the lysosomal storage disease family and results from a defective phosphotransferase (an enzyme of the Golgi apparatus). This enzyme transfers phosphate to mannose residues on specific proteins, and serves as a marker for them to be targeted to lysosomes within the cell. Without this marker, the proteins are instead excreted outside the cell—the default pathway for proteins moving through the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans) [...] in various tissues throughout the body (i.e. fibroblasts). As a result, a buildup of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristic I-cells, or [...] "inclusion cells." [...] These cells can be identified under the microscope. In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> (ML II) is a {{particularly}} severe form of ML that has a significant resemblance to another mucopolysaccharidoses called Hurler syndrome. Generally only laboratory testing can distinguish the two as the presentation is so similar. There are high plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes and are often fatal in childhood. Typically, {{by the age of}} 6 months, failure to thrive and developmental delays are obvious symptoms of this disorder. Some physical signs, such as abnormal skeletal development, coarse facial features, and restricted joint movement, may be present at birth. Children with ML II usually have enlargement of certain organs, such as the liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), and sometimes even the heart valves. Affected children often have stiff claw-shaped hands and fail to grow and develop in the first months of life. Delays in the development of their motor skills are usually more pronounced than delays in their cognitive (mental processing) skills. Children with ML II eventually develop a clouding on the cornea of their eyes and, because of their lack of growth, develop short-trunk dwarfism (underdeveloped trunk). These young patients are often plagued by recurrent respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, otitis media (middle ear infections), bronchitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Children with ML II generally die before their seventh year of life, often as a result of congestive heart failure or recurrent respiratory tract infections.|$|E

To distinguish lysosomal from non-lysosomal degradation, labelling experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of 10 mM NH 4 Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal function. It was found that <b>mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> fibroblasts exhibited a markedly reduced rate of lysosomal protein degradation, whereas the rate of nonlysosomal degradation appeared normal.

Both the intracellular and extracellular acidic alpha-mannosidase activities were completely precipitated by antiserum to placenta alpha-mannosidase B. In contrast to the heat-lability of the intracellular acidic alpha-mannosidase and its low affinity for artificial mannoside substrate, the extracellular enzyme exhibited both normal thermostability and normal kinetics.

40|$|Lysosomal hydrolases {{catalyze}} {{the degradation}} {{of a variety of}} macromolecules including proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids. The biogenesis of lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles requires a continuous substitution of soluble acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins. The targeting of lysosomal hydrolases depends on mannose 6 -phosphate residues (M 6 P) that are recognized by specific receptors mediating their transport to an endosomal/prelysosomal compartment. The key role in the formation of M 6 P residues plays the GlcNAc- 1 -phosphotransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus. Two genes have been identified recently encoding the type III alpha/beta-subunit precursor membrane protein and the soluble gamma-subunit of GlcNAc- 1 -phosphotransferase. Mutations in these genes result in two severe diseases, <b>mucolipidosis</b> type <b>II</b> (MLII) and III (MLIII), biochemically characterized by the missorting of multiple lysosomal hydrolases due to impaired formation of the M 6 P recognition marker, and general lysosomal dysfunction. This review gives an update on structural properties, localization and functions of the GlcNAc- 1 -phosphotransferase subunits and improvements of pre- and postnatal diagnosis of ML patients. Further, the generation of recombinant single-chain antibody fragments against M 6 P residues and of new mouse models of MLII and MLIII will have considerable impact to provide deeper insight into the cell biology of lysosomal dysfunctions and the pathomechanisms underlying these lysosomal disorders.

Mutations {{in the two}} genes that encode GlcNAc- 1 -phosphotransferase give rise to lysosomal storage diseases (<b>mucolipidosis</b> type <b>II</b> and III), whereas no pathological conditions {{have been associated with}} the loss of UCE activity. To analyze the consequences of UCE deficiency, the UCE gene was inactivated via insertional mutagenesis in mice. The UCE −/− mice were viable, grew normally and lacked detectable histologic abnormalities. However, the plasma levels of six acid hydrolases were elevated 1. 6 - to 5. 4 -fold over wild-type levels. These values underestimate the degree of hydrolase hypersecretion as these enzymes were rapidly cleared from the plasma by the mannose receptor. The secreted hydrolases contained GlcNAc-P-Man diesters, exhibited a decreased affinity for the cation-independent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor and failed to bind to the cation-dependent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor. These data demonstrate that UCE accounts for all the uncovering activity in the Golgi.

Bone markers, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline, also indicated a high turnover of bone metabolism; however, no apparent rickets-like changes and no increased levels of PTH were observed.

Here we present the first case of a large homozygous intragenic GNPTAB gene deletion (c. 3435 - 386 _ 3602 + 343 del 897) encompassing exon 19, identified in a ML II a/b patient. Long-range PCR and sequencing methodologies were used to refine the characterization of this rearrangement, leading to the identification of a 21 bp repetitive motif in introns 18 and 19. Further analysis revealed that both the 50 and 30 breakpoints were located within highly homologous Alu elements (Alu-Sz in intron 18 and Alu-Sq 2, in intron 19), suggesting that this deletion has probably resulted from Alu–Alu unequal homologous recombination. RT-PCR methods were used to further evaluate the consequences of the alteration for the processing of the mutant pre mRNA GNPTAB, revealing the production of three abnormal transcripts: one without exon 19 (p.

40|$|Lysosomal hydrolases are {{synthesized}} in {{the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum and specifically transported through the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network, from which transport vesicles bud to deliver them to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. The explanation of how are the lysosomal enzymes accurately recognized and selected over many other proteins in the trans-Golgi network relies on being tagged with a unique marker: the mannose- 6 -phosphate (M 6 P) group, which is added exclusively to the N-linked oligosaccharides of lysosomal soluble hydrolases, as they pass through the cis-Golgi network. Generation of the M 6 P recognition marker depends on a reaction involving two different enzymes: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1 -phosphotransferase and α-N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The M 6 P groups are then recognized by two independent transmembrane M 6 P receptors, present in the trans-Golgi network: the cation-independent M 6 P receptor and/or the cation-dependent M 6 P receptor. These proteins bind to lysosomal hydrolases on the lumenal side of the membrane and to adaptins in assembling clathrin coats on the cytosolic side. In this way, the M 6 P receptors help package the hydrolases into vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi network to deliver their contents to endosomes that ultimately will develop into mature lysosomes, where recently-delivered hydrolases may start digesting the endocyted material. The above described process {{is known as the}} M 6 P-dependent pathway and is responsible for transporting most lysosomal enzymes.

Normal AP was not observed in <b>mucolipidosis</b> type <b>II</b> (I-cell disease) fibroblasts; instead, extracts from these cells revealed the presence of two closely migrating bands with higher Mr values than normal fibroblast CRM. Furthermore, extracts of media from I-cell fibroblast cultures, but not from control or Gaucher fibroblast cultures, contained AP activity towards sphingomyelinase and beta-glucocerebrosidase. Fibroblasts from a patient with mucolipidosis type III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) showed an intermediate pattern consisting of normal as well as the higher-Mr CRM. Our data provide evidence for the existence of AP in cultured skin fibroblasts and suggest that these proteins may be targetted to the lysosome by post-translational modification in a similar manner to that reported for lysosomal enzymes...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: <b>Mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> (ML II or I-cell disease) (OMIM 252500) is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal enzyme targeting disorder that usually presents between 6 and 12 {{months of age}} with a clinical phenotype resembling Hurler syndrome and a radiological picture of dysostosis multiplex. When ML II is severe enough to be detected in the newborn period, the radiological changes {{have been described as}} similar to hyperparathyroidism or rickets. The biological basis of these findings has not been explored and few biochemical measurements have been recorded. We describe three unrelated infants with ML II who had radiological features of intrauterine hyperparathyroidism and biochemical findings consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism (marked elevation of serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels). The vitamin D metabolites were not substantially different from normal and repeatedly normal calcium concentrations excluded vitamin D deficiency rickets and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism secondary to calcium-sensing receptor gene mutations (OMIM 239200). The pathogenesis of severe hyperparathyroidism in the fetus and newborn with ML II is unexplained. We hypothesize that the enzyme targeting defect of ML II interferes with transplacental calcium transport leading to a calcium starved fetus and activation of the parathyroid response to maintain extracellular calcium concentrations within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Newborns with <b>mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> can present with radiological and biochemical signs of hyperparathyroidism. Awareness of this phenomenon may help in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls and establishing a proper diagnosis and therapy...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} <b>Mucolipidosis</b> <b>II</b> (I-cell disease) {{with a wide}} range of {{severity}} of skeletal involvement were studied. Pathological findings in two cases provided helpful information in understanding the radiographic features of dysostosis multiplex. Inhibition of the growth plate cartilage calcification and rickets-like lesions were observed in the metaphyses. Enhanced subperiosteal remodelling and paratrabecular fibrosis were also evident in the diaphyses. High levels of parathormone were found in one case. This finding supports the hypothesis that bone lesions may be secondary, at least in part, to damage in such viscera as the kidney and/or the liver and that they are mediated by vitamin D and parathormone...|$|E
40|$|To {{accomplish}} their degradative function lysosomes must {{be filled}} with specific proteins, which after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have to be directed to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for further processing and lysosomal targeting. The explanation of how lysosomal enzymes are accurately recognized and selected over many other proteins in the TGN relies on a small recognition marker, added exclusively to their N-linked oligosaccharides as they pass through the cis-Golgi: the mannose 6 -phosphate (M 6 P) group. Generation of the M 6 P recognition marker depends on a two-step reaction involving two different enzymes: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1 -phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) and -N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphodiester  -N-acetylglucosaminidase (uncovering enzyme). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase catalyses the transfer of a GlcNAc- 1 -phosphate residue from UDP-GlcNAc to C 6 positions of selected mannoses in high-mannose type oligosaccharides of the hydrolases. Then, the uncovering enzyme removes the terminal GlcNAc, exposing the M 6 P recognition signal. At the TGN, the recognition signal allows the segregation of lysosomal hydrolases from all other types of proteins through selective binding to the M 6 P receptors: the cation-independent M 6 P receptor (CI-MPR) and/or the cation-dependent M 6 P receptor (CD-MPR). The produced clathrin-coated vesicles bud off from the TGN and fuse with late endosomes (LE). At the low pH of the LE, the hydrolases dissociate from the M 6 P receptors and the empty receptors are recycled to the Golgi for further rounds of transport. Impairments in this delivery/transport pathway may result in missorting of lysosomal enzymes, with consequent severe pathological condition. Additionally, the expression levels of M 6 P pathway functional components and of the recognition marker itself may have an influence on the efficacy of some therapeutic approaches. Here we will review the current knowledge {{on each of the}} major proteins involved in the M 6 P-dependent pathway, highlighting their involvement in disease. Special attention will be given to the lysosomal storage disorders associated to GlcNAc-phosphotransferase loss of function: <b>Mucolipidosis</b> type <b>II</b> and III...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> type <b>II</b> {{and type}} III (ML II and III) are rare {{autosomal}} recessive disorders of lysosomal hydrolase trafficking respectively caused by completely absent or reduced {{activity of the}} enzyme GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the initial step in the synthesis of mannose- 6 -phosphate recognition marke. This heterohexameric enzyme composed of three subunits (alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2), {{is a product of}} two distinct genes GNPTAB and GNPTG. Mutations in GNPTAB result ML II and ML III, while mutations in GNPTG are only associated with ML III. To date more than 100 different GNPTAB mutations have been described, causing either ML II alphaβ or ML III alphaβ. Although splicing and frameshift mutations are usually associated with more severe phenotypes and missense mutations with milder ones, this typical pattern is not observed for all ML II patients. Here we report the impact of two GNPTAB missense mutations upon the protein: while W 81 L occurred in the portion of the gene that encodes the apha-subunit, R 986 C affected a genomic region encoding the beta subunit. To address this issue, the entire coding region of the wild-type GNPTAB was cloned into the pcDNAHisMax TOPO vector and the c. 440 delC (A 147 AfsX 5), c. 2956 T>C (R 986 C) and c. 242 G>T (W 81 L) were introduced on this vector using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. The presence of additional mutations, resulting from possible enzymatic misincorporation, was excluded by sequencing all constructs. COS 7 cells were transfected with control and mutant plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Protein expression levels and subcellular location were determined through Western Blot and Immunofluorescence, respectively. Results and Conclusions: We analyzed the protein expression levels of three GNPTAB mutations: c. 242 G>T (W 81 L), c. 2956 T>C (R 986 C) andc. 440 delC (A 147 AfsX 5). The frameshift c. 440 delC (A 147 AfsX 5), predicting to introduce a premature stop codon, was used as negative control. and, as expected, no GNPTAB protein product was detectable. Instead, the analysis of both missense mutations, c. 2956 T>C (R 986 C) and c. 242 G>T (W 81 L), revealed a decrease in GNPTAB protein expression, compared to the control wild type. This concurs with a previous computational assessment by the Polyphen and SIFT algorithms, predicting that the 2 mutations were likely to be potentially damaging. In addition, computational analysis ([URL] revealed that both missense mutations occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. The results of all these approaches correlate with the severe ML II phenotype of the patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{fulfill their}} degradative {{function}} lysosomes must receive specific proteins, which after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) need {{then to be}} directed to the trans Golgi network (TGN) for further processing and lysosomal targeting. The major pathway for lysosomal enzyme delivery, the M 6 P-dependent pathway, requires the recognition of a specific mannose- 6 -phosphate signal selectively added to lysosomal enzymes in the TGN. Nevertheless, increasing evidence indicates the existence of additional or alternative pathways, M 6 P-independent, from the TGN to lysosomes. Presently, two alternative receptors which mediate that transport have been described: the lysosomal integral membrane protein LIMP- 2 and sortilin. Impairments in the M 6 P pathway are responsible for two well-defined lysosomal storage disorders: <b>Mucolipidosis</b> types <b>II</b> (MLII) and III (MLIII), which are caused by total or partial loss of GlcNAc- 1 -phosphotransferase activity, respectively. This enzyme {{is responsible for the}} first of two catalytic steps that ultimately result {{in the formation of the}} M 6 P recognition marker, and is encoded by two independent genes: GNPTAB and GNPTG. In total, a set of 23 unrelated ML II and III cases from several origins was screened, leading to the identification of 18 different mutations: 16 in the GNPTAB gene and 2 in the GNPTG gene. Of those, 13 were novel: 11 in the GNPTAB gene and 2 in the GNPTG gene. All mutations identified were further analyzed with the most suitable approaches, paying special attention to the novel alterations and their effect at different levels, from molecules to the organism as a whole: mRNA and protein expression, protein subcellular location and phenotypic effects were all taken into account. Concerning the contribution of defects in the genes that code for proteins involved in the M 6 P-independent trafficking pathways, in a set of 120 individuals with clinical suspicion of LSD but without definitive biochemical and/or molecular diagnosis, no novel mutations were detected either on the gene that codes for LIMP- 2 (SCARB 2) or on the one that codes for sortilin (SORT 1). So far, no evidence came that SORT 1 deficiencies may be associated to LSD phenotypes. Still, enlarged sample sizes are needed in order to draw more reliable conclusions on the topic. The role of variations in SCARB 2 on the broad phenotype spectrum observed for Gaucher disease (GD) patients was also addressed. After the majority of Portuguese GD patients (91 individuals) was screened, one novel SCARB 2 variant was identified, reinforcing previous evidence that mutations in the gene that codes for the beta-glucocereborosidase transporter can act as GD modifiers. In general, this study reinforces the biological importance of a proper targeting of lysosomal proteins to their final destination, by highlighting the severe consequences of impairments in proteins involved in that process.
