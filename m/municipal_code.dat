40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Cities of {{the world}} today house {{more than half the}} world’s population, {{contribute}} to 80 percent of the global GDP, consume approximately 70 percent of the global energy and produce 70 percent of the greenhouse gases produced worldwide (Floater et al., 2014; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). City governments are critical players in reducing the global energy footprint. As a leading example, cities in the United States are passing legislation and taking actions to improve the sustainability of their jurisdictions and increasingly addressing renewable energy concerns. Local government programs and plans along with <b>municipal</b> <b>codes</b> have a considerable impact on city energy use. Codification is a process of organizing and arranging all legislation of a general and permanent nature into a Code. This paper addresses the key question: Is codification used by municipal governments to promote renewable energy development? If yes, then how? The paper documents and forms a policy baseline of existing renewable energy references in <b>municipal</b> <b>codes</b> of U. S. cities. It further analyzes trends of renewable energy codification as of December 2015 across different regions, states, and cities of different populations. Codes addressing renewable energy in sample jurisdictions were collected and analyzed. From this research and findings, the conclusion argues that cities frequently use codification to promote renewable energy development. Population and location of a city are key factors that influence renewable energy codification. Zoning, permitting and development codes often address renewable energy in <b>municipal</b> <b>codes.</b> Codes referencing wind energy are more standardized than codes referencing solar energy...|$|R

The council, as a body, consists of the ten aldermen and the mayor, though the mayor is generally a non-voting member who only participates in the discussion. There are a few instances where the mayor does vote on ordinances or resolutions: {{if there is a}} tie vote, if {{more than half of the}} aldermen support the motion, whether there is a tie or not, and where a vote greater than the majority is required by the <b>municipal</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Málaga, {{shaped by the}} city's {{location}} {{in the south of}} Spain on the western shore of the Mediterranean Sea, spans about 2,800 years, making Málaga one of the oldest cities in the world.

The Phoenicians founded the colony of Malaka here about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC it was under the hegemony of ancient Carthage in north Africa. From 218 BC the city was ruled by the Roman Republic and then {{at the end of the}} 1st century during the reign of Domitian it was federated with the Roman Empire as Malaca (Latin). Thereafter it was governed under its own <b>municipal</b> <b>code</b> of law, the Lex Flavia Malacitana, which granted free-born persons the privileges of Roman citizenship.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the <b>municipal</b> <b>code</b> because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell {{off the side of the}} building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E

Common arrests include possession of drugs such as marijuana, weapons, prohibited items, as well as false identification charges.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of urban service providers in Morocco: private concessionnaires (38% of urban water customers), municipal utilities (31%), the national public company ONEE (28%), and municipalities providing services directly (3%). De jure, {{according to the}} <b>municipal</b> <b>code</b> of 1976 (Charte Communale), amended in 2002 and 2008, public services such as water supply, sewerage and electricity distribution are the responsibility of municipalities (communes).

In other municipalities the Régies provide these services, often {{not on the basis}} of a specific contract. In the smaller municipalities ONEE often provides services, either with or without a contract (contrat de gestion déléguée) with the municipality. In the case of sewers, many smaller municipalities still provide this service directly, although there is a policy to gradually transfer sewer services to ONEE.|$|E
