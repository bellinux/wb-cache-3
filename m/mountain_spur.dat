5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortified}} citadel measures about 300 by 150 m. It {{stood on}} a strategically positioned <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> that rises steeply 40m above the Danube. It is at the centre of a fertile river plain, surrounded by rolling hill country.|$|E
25|$|The main 2-hectare plateau on the <b>mountain</b> <b>spur,</b> 40m {{above the}} Danube and {{naturally}} defensible, was {{the centre of}} high-status occupation and of fortification in Celtic periods. It measures only 150 by 300m but is the main visual landmark in the area. From circa 700 BC onwards, it was the centre of a large settlement.|$|E

50|$|The town is {{situated}} on the <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs</b> of the Bergische Land, between the Rhine, Ruhr and Wupper rivers. It {{is located in the}} central part of the Berg region, approx. 12 km northeast of Düsseldorf.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} part of Nerimbera is bounded to the west by the Fitzroy River and is mostly flatter land (apart from some <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs).</b> Most of the land use in Nerimbera occurs in these low-lying flatter areas and is mostly used for grazing.|$|R
25|$|Dzongs were {{frequently}} {{built on a}} hilltop or <b>mountain</b> <b>spur.</b> If the dzong is built {{on the side of}} a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).|$|E
25|$|When {{ascending}} the Fella, {{the river}} valley veers east at Pontebba and continues 10 kilometers east to Malborghetto. From the latter town, Tarvisio is 10 kilometers {{farther to the}} east. To reach Tarvisio from the Soča (Isonzo) valley, a road leaves Bovec and continues about 10 kilometers north-northeast before turning west to cross the Predil Pass (1,156 meters). At {{the foot of the}} pass is Lago del Predil (Lake Predil). From there, the road continues north again for about 10 kilometers before arriving at Tarvisio. The Predil blockhouse dominates the road about 800 meters east of the pass. The Malborghetto blockhouse lies about 900 meters east of Malborghetto village. The fort is on a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> that looms over the Fella valley.|$|E
25|$|Holding Tarvisio {{with only}} 6,000 troops, Albert Gyulay relied on two {{outlying}} forts to stall the Franco-Italian advance. At Malborghetto Valbruna, a fort frowned {{down upon the}} Fella valley from a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur.</b> The Predil Pass blockhouse stood athwart Seras' road from the south. Malborghetto was defended by Captain Friedrich Hensel with 650 Grenz infantry and 10 cannons, while Captain Johann Hermann, 250 Grenzers, and eight artillery pieces held Predil. Eugène and Seras arrived before the two forts on 15 May and initiated the Battle of Tarvis. Baraguey d'Hilliers bypassed Malborghetto with two divisions and skirmished with Albert Gyulay's main force at Tarvisio on 16 May, while Grenier moved his two divisions into assault positions below the Malborghetto fort. Beginning at 9:30 AM on 17 May, 15,000 troops stormed the position in thirty minutes. Hensel and 350 Austrians were killed and between 50 and 300 were captured. Grenier reported 80 casualties but losses were probably much heavier.|$|E
50|$|Bridgeport and the East Walker River lie to {{the east}} and south of Devil's Gate, and the West Walker River lies to the west and north.

The Little Walker Caldera lies southwest of the pass.|$|R
50|$|The Otuho-speaking {{people are}} bordered by the Lokoro in the North, Bari on the West, the Acholi and the Madi in the South, the Didinga and the Boya in the East. The Otuho-Speaking region is {{characterized}} by ranges and <b>mountains</b> <b>spurs</b> such as the Imotong mountain which is the highest with an altitude of 10,453 ft above sea level. It is also the highest mountain {{in the whole of}} Sudan.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} prone to flooding. Also, while the {{location}} between {{the river and the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs</b> greatly improved the defensive capabilities of the fort, it also impeded the development of transportation links. In 1840, after a major fire, the settlement was moved across the river to the left bank. The old site came to be called Stary Selenginsk, or Staroselenginsk, and the new one became known as Novoselenginsk.|$|R

2500|$|Portlethen Moss is {{considered}} a raised bog, because its general situation is on higher ground, {{at the edge of}} the Mounth, a coastal <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> of the Grampian Mountains overlooking the North Sea. [...] There are rock outcrops and strewn boulders relict from the glacial age at this site. [...] Elevations within the Portlethen Moss range from approximately 35 to 60 metres above sea level. [...] Formation of this moss has occurred due to extensive sets of depressions in the underlying rock formations of Old Red Sandstone. [...] The entire water composition of the bog thus has been provided by precipitation with no source of surface runoff, since the topography reduces to lower elevations in every direction. [...] Due to the high winds, moderate precipitation and cool temperatures that generally prevail, conditions are favourable for formation of an acid bog, since water stagnates, but eventually evaporates with ensuing acidity enhancement of decaying organic matter. [...] There was virtually no drainage outlet in prehistoric times, and little drainage even in modern times.|$|E
2500|$|Trongsa means [...] "the new village" [...] in Bhutanese, which {{comprises}} retreats, {{temples and}} hermitages of monks. Its rich history is {{traced to the}} founding of a temple in the area by the Drukpa lama, Ngagi Wangchuk, ancestor of Shabdrung Namgyal, who came to this place from Ralung in 1541, and built a small meditation room in 1543. One day he had been meditating nearby in a village called Yuling and witnessed a light ("from a body of lamps") at the furthest point of the spur. He believed this to be an auspicious sign and erected a temple on the spot, on a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> high above the gorges of the Mangde Chhu, {{at an altitude of}} [...] Note: the altitude is given as [...] by Dorje. Another version for building a temple here is that Ngagi Wangchuk saw self manifest hoof prints of a horse that belonged to the Protector deity Palden Lhamo. He then decided to build a small meditation centre, a tshamkhang, at that location. One more version of the legend states that Ngagi Wangchuk after witnessing the lights from lamps, went into a cave nearby for meditation where he found a small spring. He also visioned that the spring had been used by the Mahakali (Peldon Lhamo) for sacred ablutions with other dakinis. He then built a small temple, which has now become the main temple Gunkhang. He also developed it into a small village with several houses and the place thus {{came to be known as}} drongsar ("new village") and popularly known in the local dialect as 'Trongsa'. He further inferred from the shape of the rocky hill, that it was in the form a conch shell with concentric rings (in clockwise direction) and hence named the monastery as Choe-Khor-Rab-Ten-Tse or by a shorter version as Chotse that represents [...] " [...] the temple fixed firmly at the tip of the dharma wheel-the conchshell". The original temple site is today located at the end of the dzong, at the Temple of Chortens.|$|E
50|$|Geologically, Dominica {{is part of}} {{the rugged}} Lesser Antilles {{volcanic}} arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from 300 to 1400 m above sea level. Several east-west trending <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs</b> extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has level stretches no wider than 2000 m. The highest peak is Morne Diablotins, at 1447 m; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of 1423 m, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} section (Dzhugdzur) is bisected by the Dzhugdzur Ridge, which reaches 1,400 to 1,800 {{meters in}} height. The southeastern {{part of the}} Dzhugdzurksy section {{is a series of}} <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs</b> to the coastal strip and is very hard to access. The highest point in the northern section is Mt. Topko (1,906 meters). The southern section of the reserve ("Coastal") is a ridge of 600-800 meters that drops precipitously to the Okhotsk Sea coast. Along the entire ridge there is only one river cut (the Lantar River valley), and the rocky sea cliffs make this section also very hard to access.|$|R

60|$|It {{had been}} a {{transforming}} honeymoon. She had been frightened to discover how tumultuous a feeling could be roused in her. Will had been lordly--stalwart, jolly, impressively competent in making camp, tender and understanding through the hours when they had lain {{side by side in}} a tent pitched among pines high up on a lonely <b>mountain</b> <b>spur.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the small}} open glade the pack-horses dragged about their ropes. A short {{distance}} in front, the thick timber stopped and a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> went up to the dim white peaks. The sun had gone and the sky was calm and green. One heard a river brawl and a faint wind in the trees. Deering lay in the pine needles and rubbed his neck.|$|E
60|$|But, whether German or Turk, Tyrker was an {{enthusiastic}} trapper of white, or arctic foxes. These creatures being very numerous {{in that part}} of Greenland, he was wont to go out at all hours, late and early, to visit his traps. Hence it happened that, on the night in question, Tyrker found himself in company with two captured arctic foxes at, the extremity of the <b>mountain</b> <b>spur</b> before referred to.|$|E
60|$|Below this I {{passed an}} {{extensive}} stalactitic deposit of lime, {{and a second}} occurred lower down, {{on the opposite side}} of the valley. The apparently total absence of limestone rocks in any part of Sikkim (for which I made careful search), renders these deposits, which are far from unfrequent, very curious. Can the limestone, which appears in Tibet, underlie the gneiss of Sikkim? We cannot venture to assume that these lime-charged streams, which in Sikkim burst from the steep flanks of narrow <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs,</b> at elevations between 1000 and 7000 feet, have any very remote or deep origin. If the limestone be not below the gneiss, it must either occur intercalated with it, or be the remains of a formation now all but denuded in Sikkim.|$|R

60|$|Bildad had halted {{upon the}} {{shoulder}} of the first <b>mountain</b> <b>spur.</b> Two rail-fences, ragged-black, hemmed the road. Fifty yards above the upper fence, showing a dark blot in the white drifts, stood a small house. Upon this house descended--or rather ascended--Judge Menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress. They called; they pounded at window and door. At the inhospitable silence they waxed restive; they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers, and invaded the premises.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy nodded. He {{knew the}} police had not bothered Margaret and he must think for himself.

The valley in which he hid did not open to the track; to reach it one must climb a <b>mountain</b> <b>spur,</b> but he imagined the police meant to climb. If they found the mouth of the valley, they might reach the shack before he knew, and if he got away, he must take the snowy rocks.|$|E
5000|$|At {{daylight}} on 7 October 1813 Wellington {{crossed the}} Bidassoa in seven columns, attacked the entire French position, which stretched in two heavily entrenched lines from {{north of the}} Irun-Bayonne road, along <b>mountain</b> <b>spurs</b> to the Great Rhune 2800 ft high. The decisive movement was a passage in strength near Fuenterrabia to the astonishment of the enemy, who {{in view of the}} width of the river and the shifting sands, had thought the crossing impossible at that point. The French right was then rolled back, and Soult was unable to reinforce his right in time to retrieve the day. His works fell in succession after hard fighting, and he withdrew towards the river Nivelle. The losses were about—Allies, 1,600; French, 1,400. The passage of the Bidassoa [...] "was a general's not a soldier's battle".|$|R

60|$|The {{afternoon}} was hot, the little wineberry bushes were soft, and Jimmy {{lay in a}} big hemlock's shade. A few yards in front, a falling pine had broken the row of straight red trunks, and in the gap shining snow peaks cut the serene sky. Below, the trees rolled down the hillside, and at the bottom a river sparkled. Rivers, however, were numerous, the bush on the hill-bench Jimmy had crossed was thick, and he frankly {{did not know where}} he had come down. If the hotel was in the valley, he need not bother, but he doubted, and was not keen about climbing another <b>mountain</b> <b>spur.</b> In the meantime, he smoked his pipe and mused.|$|E

There was, however, a vein of tenacity in Weston, and he was quietly bent on going on to the end--that is, until there were no more provisions left than would carry them back to the cache, marching on considerably less than half rations.|$|E
