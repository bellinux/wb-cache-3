This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in a digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Information</b> on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once {{we have a better}} understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts that can be used to preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E

2500|$|A {{representative}} {{survey of}} 238,206 Britons, exclusive to their categories, found 1% identified as {{gay or lesbian}} and 0.5% said they were bisexual. A further 0.5% self-identified as [...] "other", and 3% responded as [...] "do not know" [...] or refused to answer. In total this adds up to 5% {{of people who do}} not identify as heterosexual, or alternatively 98.5% who do not identify as either gay, lesbian or bisexual. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of the gay equality charity Stonewall stated: [...] "This {{is the first time that}} people were asked and data collection happened on doorsteps or over the phone, which may deter people from giving accurate responses – particularly if someone isn't openly gay at home." [...] Stonewall worked with 600 major employers and their experience had shown that these statistics increased when people were regularly asked about sexual orientation as part of general <b>monitoring</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
