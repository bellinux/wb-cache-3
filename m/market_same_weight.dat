40|$|For several years, {{there has}} been an ongoing debate about one {{inefficiency}} of markets, namely, stock market myopic behavior or stock market short-termism. This inefficiency is described as being a situation where investors overvalue short-term earnings and undervalue long-term earnings. This study examines whether the Portuguese stock market exhibits such preference for short-term earnings for the period between 2000 and 2008, using the Abarbanell and Bernard (2000) accounting-based valuation model, which generates predictions about how prices should relate to book value, as well as expected short-term and long-term earnings. Empirical analysis is not conclusive. In fact the evidence collected for this period based on Abarbanell and Bernard’s (2000) cross-section analysis favours market efficiency and therefore we reject the claim of market myopia. According to this result, the Portuguese stock <b>market</b> assigns the <b>same</b> <b>weight</b> for all the value components of listed companies. Based on an innovative panel data analysis, we collected evidence on which market assumes a particular form of short-termism, as investors value efficiently book value and short-term earnings, but undervalue long-term earnings. This paper contributes with quantitative evidence for the rising public policy debate regarding the scale of short-termism in capital markets. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
