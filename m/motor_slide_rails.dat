40|$|Abstract. <b>Slide</b> <b>rails</b> {{are usually}} {{fabricated}} by roll forming {{and are used}} in kitchenware and cabinets mostly. However the product weight of <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> is increased because larger dimensions are required to bear larger load when they are used in dies and warehouses. International suppliers start to develop Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to decrease the product weight in recent years. The manufacturing and functional feasibility of Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> were discussed in this study. The Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> was designed according to ready-made <b>slide</b> <b>rail,</b> and the aluminum alloy was selected with required mechanical properties. The suitable extrusion die was designed and direct extrusion parameters of extrusion ratio, extrusion temperature, extrusion speed and extrusion load are also considered. The extrusion process of aluminum alloy was simulated by CAE software to check the mold and process design. The extrusion part of aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> {{was carried out by}} extruder to verify the simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Water vapor and {{aerosols}} {{are important}} atmospheric constituents. Knowledge {{of the structure}} of water vapor is important in understanding convective development, atmospheric stability, the interaction of the atmosphere with the surface, and energy feedback mechanisms and how they relate to global warming calculations. The Raman Lidar group at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) developed an advanced Raman Lidar for use in measuring water vapor and aerosols in the earth's atmosphere. Drawing on the experience gained through the development and use of our previous Nd:YAG based system, we have developed a completely new lidar system which uses a XeF excimer laser and a large scanning mirror. The additional power of the excimer and the considerably improved optical throughput of the system have resulted in approximately a factor of 25 improvement in system performance for nighttime measurements. Every component of the current system has new design concepts incorporated. The lidar system consists of two mobile trailers; the first (13 m x 2. 4 m) houses the lidar instrument, the other (9. 75 m x 2. 4 m) is for system control, realtime data display, and analysis. The laser transmitter is a Lambda Physik LPX 240 iCC operating at 400 Hz with a XeF gas mixture (351 nm). The telescope is a. 75 m horizontally mounted Dall-Kirkham system which is bore sited with a. 8 m x 1. 1 m elliptical flat which has a full 180 degree scan capability - horizon to horizon within a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the trailer. The telescope and scan mirror assembly are mounted on a 3. 65 m x. 9 m optical table which deploys out the rear of the trailer {{through the use of a}} <b>motor</b> driven <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> system. The Raman returns from water vapor (403 nm), nitrogen (383 nm) and oxygen (372 nm) are measured in addition to the direct Rayleigh/Mie backscatter (351). The signal from each of these is split at about a 5 / 95 ratio between two photomultiplier detectors. The 5 percent detector is used for measurements below about 4. 0 km, while the 95 percent detector provides the information above this level...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper details an experimental-numerical approach for the quantitative correlation between wear and end-point deflection in a <b>slide</b> <b>rail.</b> Focusing the attention on <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> utilized in white-goods applications, the aim is to evaluate the number of cycles the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> can operate, under different load conditions, before it should be replaced due to unacceptable end-point deflection. In this paper, two formulations are utilized to describe the wear: Archard model for the linear wear and Lemaitre damage model for the non- linear wear. The linear wear gradually reduces the surface of the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> whereas the non- linear one accounts for the surface element deletion (i. e. due to pitting). To determine the constants to use in the wear models, simple tension test and sliding wear test, by utilizing a designed and developed experiment machine, have been carried out. A full <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> model simulation has been implemented in ABAQUS including both linear and non-linear wear models and the results have been compared with those of the real rails under different load condition, provided by the rail manufacturer. The comparison between numerically estimated and real rail results proved the reliability of the developed numerical model, limiting the error in a ± 10 % range. The proposed approach allows predicting the displacement vs cycle curves, parametrized for different loads and, based on a chosen failure criterion, to predict the lifetime of the rail...|$|R

5000|$|In early 1916 Sergeant Foster of 11 Squadron RFC {{improved}} the French hinged mounting {{for the upper}} wing Lewis gun on a Nieuport 11 or 16, by replacing the awkward double hinge of the French mount with a quadrant shaped <b>sliding</b> <b>rail.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> became the feature of all later [...] "Foster" [...] mountings, and enabled the breech of the gun to swing back and down in one movement, bringing the breech conveniently {{in front of the}} pilot, and making it much easier to change ammunition drums or to clear stoppages.|$|R
30|$|The arm can rotate {{and move}} a gripper, {{attached}} to the robot base, along the vertical axis. The rotation of the gripper occurs around the vertical axis. We adopt a multi-step vertical movement mechanism. Fig.  4 a shows {{an overview of the}} multi-step up–down mechanism. By connecting the five-step <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> with the chains and the sprockets, all of the <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> are driven relative to the movement of the top rail. The rotary motion of the servo motor is transformed to linear motion by the ball screw allowing the top <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> to move {{up and down in the}} vertical direction. This mechanism is based on the extension mechanism of a ladder truck. Fig.  4 b, c show the installation of the multi-step up–down mechanism in the actual process. When the vertical component is contracted, all parts are held above the worker, which prevents collisions with the worker and ensures the worker’s safety.|$|R
50|$|The first railway {{switches}} {{were in fact}} wagon turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> Turnplates {{were initially}} made of two or four pieces of wood, circular in form, that replicated the track running through them. Their diameter matched that of the wagons used on any given wagonway, and they swung around a central pivot. Loaded wagons could be moved onto the turnplate, and rotating the turnplate 90 degrees allowed the loaded wagon to be moved to another piece of wagonway. Thus, wagon weight was limited only by {{the strength of the}} wood used in the turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> When iron and later steel replaced stone and wood, weight capacity rose again.|$|R
50|$|Grendel Inc., {{founded by}} George Kellgren, was a Florida {{firearms}} company which produced polymer framed semi-automatic pistols from 1987 to 1994.

40|$|A {{device for}} {{enabling}} a wheelchair user {{to enter and}} exit the wheelchair includes a stabilizing frame. The stabilizing frame has two <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to which a base plate is movingly attached. An electric motor drives a leadscrew, causing the base plate to move along the <b>slide</b> <b>rails.</b> A telescopic column is vertically mounted onto the base plate. The seat assembly, including handlebars and a seat platform, is rotationally attached {{to the top of}} the telescopic column. The telescopic column is extended and collapsed by a linear actuator, raising and lowering the seat assembly. A stationary non-rotational rod is vertically mounted onto the telescopic column. When a user sitting on the seat platform exerts a moment force on the stationary rod, the seat assembly rotates about the stationary rod. A locking mechanism prevents the seat assembly from rotating when the user is transferring to or from the seat platform...|$|R
50|$|The first {{option is}} the most common, with the foot {{stretcher}} and flywheel both fixed, with only the seat <b>sliding</b> on a <b>rail.</b> This is generally analogous to the seat <b>sliding</b> on <b>rails</b> in the boat. Commonly called a 'Fixed head' ergometer.|$|R
5000|$|While <b>sliding</b> a <b>rail</b> {{the skier}} jumps and turns 180 degrees so {{they end up}} <b>sliding</b> the <b>rail</b> in the {{opposite}} direction. Also called 'swap'. Swaps can be done 'frontside' or 'backside/blindside'. As well, skiers can switch-up more than 180 degrees; for example, a '360-switch-up'/'3-swap' involves the skier jumping on a rail feature, spinning 360 degrees, and landing again on the rail.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{production}} of the classic models was largely ceased {{in favor of a}} new series of pistols taking most of their features from the Charles Petter SACM style of pistols (also seen in the SIG P210 and CZ-75. Namely, these all had inverted <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> and closed cam path locking. Many also had modular (removable) trigger assemblies. Most were double-action, though some retained the classic style single-action lockwork.|$|R
50|$|A spiral {{recoil spring}} is {{positioned}} horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of {{the receiver and}} rails of the breechblock. An illustration of this spring {{is shown in the}} , Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. When the pistol is discharged, as the breechblock moves to the rear and the <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> travel back in the receiver guides, the cross-beam at the forward end serves to compress the recoil spring against the frame.|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{problems}} with turnplates and <b>sliding</b> <b>rails</b> were twofold. First, they were relatively small (often no more than [...] in length), which limited the wagon length that could be turned. Second, their switching capacity could only be accessed when the wagon {{was on top of}} them and still, which limited the total capacity of any wagonway. The railway switch, which overcame both of these problems, was patented by Charles Fox in 1832.|$|R
50|$|The {{flexible}} conveyor {{is based}} on a conveyor beam in aluminum or stainless steel, with low friction <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> guiding a plastic multi-flexing chain. Products to be conveyed travel directly on the conveyor, or on pallets/carriers. These conveyors can be worked around obstacles and keep production lines flowing. They are made at varying levels and can work in multiple environments. They are used in food packaging, case packing, and pharmaceutical industries but also in retail stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} the structure, working principle, simple calculation and main {{application of the}} linear motion unit. Foreword Modern manufacturing technology is developing towards high speed, precision and modularization. In microelectronics field, the traditional feed system is mainly "rotating servo motor + ball screw" drive mode, which can achieve the highest feed speed of 90 - 120 m/min, with the maximum acceleration only of 1. 5 g. [1] Along with progress of science and technology, linear motion unit of modular design has emerged. Linear motion unit is widely used in modern industry. This is {{a new type of}} mechanical part. It integrated the traditional mechanical drive mechanism and guide mechanism in one and reserves the interface of drive device. This enables the whole mechanical mechanism to be more compact, the drive to be more smoothly and the movement precision to be higher.
