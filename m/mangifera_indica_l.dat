5000|$|F. mangiferae {{is one of}} {{the causal}} agents of {{malformation}} disease that affects mango (<b>Mangifera</b> <b>indica,</b> <b>L.)</b> growing regions and is economically important. It causes mango malformation disease (MMD) and induces vegetative development abnormalities in shoots that leads to misshaped buds, short internodes, dwarf and narrow leaves. Moreover, MMD causes hormone imbalances in the inflorescence that leads to abnormalities [...] such as an increase in size and numbers, especially for male flowers. They are usually sterile or, if fertilized, abort after fruit set. The malformation of flowers causes a decrease in fruit yields. A Fusarium toxin has been found {{to play a role in}} the malformation symptoms on mango. Rootstocks from seedlings used for grafting can also be infected.|$|E
