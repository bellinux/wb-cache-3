500|$|After {{conducting}} {{extensive research}} on the topography of Japan, an [...] scale model (1 foot: 1 mile) of target areas was fabricated complete with mountains, buildings, railroads and the rice paddies. It also depicted clouds and fog. The films were produced using a specially <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> camera. The camera was motorized and could be moved to simulate an airplane's flight over the model. According to the New York Sun, [...] "the camera recorded what the crew of a B-29 would see from 30,000 feet." [...] Using the films, pilots of the 20th Air Force easily found their targets and were amazed {{at the level of}} detail and the accuracy that the unit was able to produce. General Arnold said the following of the units accomplishment: [...] "there never has been anything quite so good as this for briefing men on dangerous missions." ...|$|E

50|$|Capital Radio plc and GWR Group plc merged in 2005 and on 1 May that year, {{the newly}} {{enlarged}} group was renamed GCap Media plc. The first {{effects of the}} GCap merger were felt by Invicta FM soon afterwards. New boss Craig Boddy, assisted by GCap management (Hugh Murray and regional programme boss Peter Sinclair), undertook a radical restructure of the station in September 2005, in response to falling listening figures and <b>mounting</b> <b>overheads.</b> Boddy changed Invicta from the style influenced by nearby Capital FM, to one which roughly resembled the old Mix Network. Invicta was possibly the last local radio station owned by the company (outside London) to be live and local 24/7*, escaping overnight networking and voicetracking at times when Capital Radio-owned stablemates like Ocean, Southern and Power succumbed to one or the other.|$|R
50|$|The twin shaft-turbine engines {{used in the}} Mi-2 develop 40% {{more power}} than the Mi-1's piston engines, for barely half the engine weight, {{with the result that}} the payload was more than doubled. The Mi-2 {{fuselage}} was extensively altered from its predecessor, with the engines <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead.</b> However, the external dimensions remained similar.|$|E
50|$|Surface-mounted {{door closers}} come in four variations: slide-track arm, regular arm surface mounted, {{parallel}} arm surface mounted, and top jamb <b>mounted.</b> <b>Overhead</b> door closers are typically surface mounted, some manufacturers offer concealed models too.

50|$|Open-road cashless tolling {{started on}} January 4, 2017 at 3 am. The tollbooths are being dismantled, and drivers {{can no longer}} pay cash at the tunnel. Instead, cameras <b>mounted</b> onto <b>overhead</b> {{gantries}} located on the Manhattan side take photos of license plates of cars {{that do not have}} E-ZPass transponders, and tolls are mailed to them. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.|$|R
50|$|The M-10 is a cantilevered, high wing, {{conventional}} landing gear-equipped {{aircraft that}} seats two in tandem. The all-wood wing {{is able to}} pivot 90 degrees for trailering or storage. The pivot works by removing four bolts, using a jack to raise the wing a few inches for pivoting, then lowering the wing again, reattaching the bolts in the same pattern. The controls are <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead.</b> The front and rear occupant each have an individual door for entry on either side.|$|E
50|$|The {{condensing}} {{equipment was}} <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> in a roof-like frame {{and consisted of}} copper coils which formed an atmospheric radiator. Condensed steam was fed back for re-use into the large water tank underneath the locomotive's copper boiler. To protect the motion and bearings as well as working parts of the valve gear above the running boards from wind-blown sand, the locomotive was equipped with sheet-metal casing {{above and below the}} running boards, with the centre part of the bottom encasement hinged to allow access to the motion.|$|E
5000|$|The engine, with {{cylinder}} block and upper crankcase cast in one piece, {{had a single}} centrally <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> camshaft, hemispherical combustion chambers, and an 89 mm bore. [...] The engine was offered {{in one of two}} capacities: [...] with a 140 mm stroke, producing [...] at 2,500 rpm or [...] with a 146 mm stroke and twin carburettors, producing [...] at 3,500 rpm. The crankshaft ran in five bearings. Ignition was by coil and distributor rather than magneto which was the more usual British practice at the time.|$|E

50|$|The vehicle {{comes in}} several {{variants}} {{with a common}} engine, transmission, hydraulics, wheels, tires, differentials and transfer case. The M1130 Command Vehicle and M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle have an air conditioning unit mounted on the back. The medical vehicle also has a higher-capacity generator. A recent upgrade program provided a field retrofit kit to add air conditioning units to all variants, and production started in 2005 on the Mobile Gun System <b>mounting</b> an <b>overhead</b> GDLS 105 mm automatic gun.|$|R
50|$|The multi-lane {{free flow}} ETC system {{operates}} without any toll booths. Cameras and other sensors <b>mounted</b> on <b>overhead</b> gantries register either the e-tag or the vehicle license plate number, and an amount is deducted from an eTag registered road user's account. For verification each vehicle is photographed from above for length classification, with additional {{photos of the}} front and rear number plates. The 43 overhead gantries are spaced at about 10 km intervals on the N1, N3, N12 and R21 highways.|$|R
50|$|The Welch OW-5M (along {{with the}} OW-6M, OW-7M and OW-8M) were {{a family of}} American two-seat light cabin monoplanes {{designed}} by Orin Welch based on his first cabin monoplane design, the ACA Falcon. Welch's goal was to design cheap and functional light aircraft. The aircraft is a strut-braced high-wing monoplane with an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seats for two. It is similar in appearance to the Aeronca C-3, save for the wing struts. It had a steerable tailwheel landing gear and a nose-mounted engine. The fuselage was constructed with fabric covered welded steel tubing with a triangular cross section. The controls were <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> with an adjustable control wheel that could be positioned for either pilot. Welch developed their own low-pressure wheels and tires for suspension.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{signals in}} most areas of Europe are located at the stop line on {{same side of the}} {{intersection}} as the approaching traffic (there being both right- and left-hand traffic) and are often <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> as well as on side of the road. At particularly busy junctions for freight, higher lights may be mounted specifically for trucks. The stop line alignment is done to prevent vehicles blocking any crosswalk and allow for better pedestrian traffic flow. There may also be a special area a few meters in advance of the stop line where cyclists may legally wait but not motor vehicles; this advanced stop line is often painted with a different road surface with greater friction and a high colour, both for the benefit of cyclists and for other vehicles. The traffic lights are mounted so that cyclists can still see them.|$|E
50|$|In {{sprinkler}} or overhead irrigation, {{water is}} piped {{to one or}} more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system utilizing sprinklers, sprays, or guns <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead</b> on permanently installed risers {{is often referred to as}} a solid-set irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called rotors an are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in² (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging.|$|E
2500|$|Increasing {{width of}} track centres of [...] or more {{makes it much}} easier to <b>mount</b> signals and <b>overhead</b> wiring structures. Very wide centres at major bridges can have {{military}} value. It also makes it harder for rogue ships and barges knocking out both bridges in the same accident.|$|R
50|$|A gantry (also {{known as}} a sign holder, road sign holder, sign {{structure}} or road sign structure) is a traffic sign assembly in which signs are <b>mounted</b> on an <b>overhead</b> support, or railway signals supported.

50|$|The Tunnel Portal Buildings, at {{each end}} of the tunnel, house the {{maintenance}} garages, office space for Department maintenance personnel, and the exhaust and ventilation fan equipment for the tunnel. These buildings are constructed of cast-in-place concrete. The West Portal Building is constructed on caissons and has a series of chambers that comprise its basement. The rear portion of the building basementhas no floor and is, in effect, a set of bridges that carry I-376 East and West above it. The East Portal Building is built on a series of variable-depth spread footings and contains no basement. Otherwise, the Portal Buildings have identical geometry. The facades and exterior surfaces of the Portal Buildings are sandstone and brick veneer with louvered openings and block-glass windows. A variety of cellular phone equipment has been added to the walls and roofs of the Portal Buildings. Additionally, the entrance to each tunnel has traffic signals <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead,</b> which are part of the over-height truck detection system.|$|E
5000|$|The Lancer was {{designed}} specifically for flight schools seeking an inexpensive way to train students for a multi-engine rating, a role in which the craft's modest performance and payload were anticipated to matter little. To increase its appeal to flight schools, the Lancer was equipped with a mock landing gear retraction switch that operates green “safe” and red “unsafe” lights in the cockpit, allowing a student pilot to feign operation of imaginary [...] "retractable" [...] (it was permanently fixed) landing gear on takeoff and landing during instructional flights. In a peculiar combination, the front seat was equipped with a control yoke, while the rear-seat pilot had a centre stick. Both seats were equipped with engine controls <b>mounted</b> <b>overhead,</b> with solo flight being performed from the front seat. Braking was controlled with a lever {{on the right-hand side}} of the front-seat instrument panel; differential braking was not possible, and no brake controls were provided for the rear-seat pilot. Other features included single-slotted wing flaps with 4 adjustment positions, and pilot-adjustable trim tabs for the elevator and rudder; elevator trim was adjusted using a sidewall-mounted lever.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944 the United States readied {{its forces}} in the Pacific Theatre for the final assault on the Japanese mainland. The 20th Air Force, tasked with {{carrying}} out the bombing campaign, lacked necessary information regarding flight routes and targeting data. Orr explains what the unit was expected to deliver: every landmark, check point, initial point and bomb release point ... every radar center, every Japanese naval vessel in a harbor, every railroad, building and forest and rice paddies ... The objects had to appear not only as seen {{on a clear day}} by the naked eye, but also as viewed by a radar screen through an overcast. After conducting extensive research on the topography of Japan, an 80 x 60 ft scale model (1 foot: 1 mile) of target areas was fabricated complete with mountains, buildings, railroads and the rice paddies.
