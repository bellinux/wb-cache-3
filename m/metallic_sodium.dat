5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} <b>metallic</b> <b>sodium</b> from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where <b>metallic</b> <b>sodium</b> is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>metallic</b> <b>sodium</b> {{has some}} {{important}} uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; {{evaporation}} of these solutions leaves a shiny film of <b>metallic</b> <b>sodium.</b> The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH3)6)+, with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit {{the isolation of}} these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands. For example, 15-crown-5 has high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2Å, which is enough to fit sodium ion (1.9Å). Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na− are obtainable)|date=1974|volume=96|issue=2|pages=608–609|doi=10.1021/ja00809a060}} {{by the addition of}} cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via disproportionation.|$|E

25|$|A {{specific}} {{risk of the}} sodium-cooled fast reactor is related to using <b>metallic</b> <b>sodium</b> as a coolant. In case of a breach, sodium explosively reacts with water. Fixing breaches may also prove dangerous, as the cheapest noble gas argon {{is also used to}} prevent sodium oxidation. Argon, like helium, can displace oxygen in the air and can pose hypoxia concerns, so workers may be exposed to this additional risk. This is a pertinent problem as demonstrated by the events at the loop type Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju at Tsuruga, Japan.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of Mossbauer spectra in <b>metallic</b> iron, <b>sodium</b> nitroprusside, sodium ferrocyanide, and {{potassium}} ferrocyanide absorbers between 78 and 293 K. The temperature dependences of the Mossbauer fraction and the resonant velocity were fitted to Einstein and Debye lattice-vibration models. The characteristic temperatures {{of the models}} fitted to the Mossbauer fraction are consistently lower than those fitted to the resonant velocity showing {{the sensitivity of the}} Mossbauer fraction to low-frequency modes of vibration. The characteristic temperatures obtained from the resonant velocity are higher for the salts than for the metal, indicating the presence of higher-frequency modes in the salts. This interpretation is verified semiquantitatively by comparing the thermal-shift Debye temperatures of the salts to their infrared absorption frequencies. The Mossbauer fraction of potassium ferrocyanide shows a weaker temperature dependence than that expected for a harmonic solid, which suggests that potassium ferrocyanide is anharmonic in the temperature range studied...|$|R
40|$|Rough electrodeposition, {{uncontrolled}} parasitic side-reactions with electrolytes and dendrite-induced short-circuits have hindered {{development of}} advanced energy storage technologies based on <b>metallic</b> lithium, <b>sodium</b> and aluminium electrodes.

Here we report a facile and scalable method of fabricating tough, freestanding membranes that combine the best attributes of solid polymers, nanocomposites and gel-polymer electrolytes. Hairy nanoparticles are employed as multifunctional nodes for polymer crosslinking, which produces mechanically robust membranes that are exceptionally effective in inhibiting dendrite growth in a lithium metal battery. The membranes are also reported to enable stable cycling of lithium batteries paired with conventional intercalating cathodes.

Particles were distributed on the PS surface, and PS pieces presented a good antibacterial efficiency at 100, 300, and 500 [*]ppm and decreased for 700 [*]ppm due to an additive agglomeration on the PS surface. These results validate the antibacterial properties of Ag/TiO 2, determine a concentration limit at which the additive is well distributed on the PS surface, and assess the importance of Ag in this system...|$|R
500|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>sodium</b> is used {{mainly for}} the {{production}} of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. [...] Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma ("vapor") lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, {{it can be used to}} reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible light telescopes.|$|E

40|$|From {{observations}} of the <b>metallic</b> species <b>sodium</b> (Na), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) in Mercury's exosphere, we derive implications for source and loss processes. All metallic species observed exhibit a distribution and/or line width characteristic of high to extreme temperature - {{tens of thousands of}} degrees K. The temperatures of refractory species, including magnesium and calcium, indicate that the source process for the atoms observed in the tail and near-planet exosphere are consistent with ion sputtering and/or impact vaporization of a molecule with subsequent dissociation into the atomic form. The extended Mg tail is consistent with a surface abundance of 5 - 8 % Mg by number, if 30 % of impact-vaporized Mg remains as MgO and half of the impact vapor condenses. Globally, ion sputtering is not a major source of Mg, but locally the sputtered source can be larger than the impact vapor source. We conclude that the Na and K in Mercury's exosphere can be derived from a regolith composition similar to that of Luna 16 soil (or Apollo 17 orange glass), in which the abundance by number is 0. 0027 (0. 0028) for Na and 0. 0006 (0. 0045) for K...|$|R

The main disadvantage shared by all of these amylase procedures is that unstable starch substrate solutions must be prepared fresh every day or so. A few references mention the preservation of starch substrates for amylase procedures, but the results so far have been unsatisfactory (4 - 6). The present study was undertaken primarily to develop a stable starch substrate solution that could be employed in a convenient pro-cedure for the determination of the c-amylase activity of biologic materials such as serum, urine, and tissue extracts.
