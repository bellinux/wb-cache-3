5|$|The terms {{billion and}} <b>milliard</b> both {{originally}} meant 1012 when introduced.|$|E
5|$|In many short scale countries, <b>milliard</b> {{was dropped}} {{altogether}} and billion was redefined down to 109, adjusting downwards {{the value of}} trillion and all the larger numbers.|$|E
5|$|In some short scale countries, <b>milliard</b> was redefined down to 109 and billion dropped altogether, with {{trillion}} redefined down to 1012 {{and so on}} for {{the larger}} numbers.|$|E
5|$|The word, <b>milliard,</b> or its translation, {{is found}} in many European {{languages}} and is used in those languages for 109. However, it is unknown in American English, which uses billion, and not used in British English, which preferred to use thousand million before the current usage of billion. The financial term, yard, which derives from <b>milliard,</b> is used on financial markets, as, unlike the term, billion, it is internationally unambiguous and phonetically distinct from million. Likewise, many long scale countries use the word billiard (or similar) for one thousand long scale billions (i.e., 1015), and the word trilliard (or similar) for one thousand long scale trillions (i.e., 1021), etc.|$|E
5|$|In long scale countries, <b>milliard</b> was redefined down to {{its current}} value of 109, leaving billion at its {{original}} 1012 value and so on for the larger numbers. Some of these countries, but not all, introduced new words billiard, trilliard, etc. as intermediate terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} long {{scale is}} used by most Continental European countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to billion to mean 1012. Some use a word similar to <b>milliard</b> to mean 109, while others use a word or phrase equivalent to thousand millions.|$|E
25|$|While {{maintaining}} the original {{system of the}} French mathematician Nicolas Chuquet (1484) for the names of large numbers, Jacques Pelletier promoted <b>milliard</b> for 1012 which had been used earlier by Budaeus. In the late 17th century, <b>milliard</b> was subsequently reduced to 109. This convention is used widely in long scale countries.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, France {{uses the}} infix {{notation}} like most countries. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French {{use the word}} billion for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called a trillion. However, there exists a French word, <b>milliard,</b> for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite {{the use of the}} long scale, one billion is called un <b>milliard</b> ("one milliard") in French, and not mille millions ("one thousand million"). It {{should also be noted that}} names of numbers above the <b>milliard</b> are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called mille milliards ("one thousand milliard") in French, and rarely un billion.|$|E
25|$|Burnett was an eighth-round {{pick of the}} New York Mets in the 1995 amateur draft. He {{was traded}} to the Marlins with Jesús Sánchez and Robert Stratton for Al Leiter and Ralph <b>Milliard</b> before the 1998 season when the Marlins {{dismantled}} their 1997 World Series championship roster. He was first called up to the Marlins from Class AA Portland in 1999, despite having a record of 6–12 and an ERA of 5.52 with Portland.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 and 1946, {{hyperinflation}} {{caused the}} issuance of notes up to 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). During the hyperinflation, note designs were reused, changing the colour and replacing the word pengő with first milpengő, then b.-pengő, to generate higher denominations. The largest denomination produced was 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). The note was initially worth about US$0.20. Notes of one <b>milliard</b> b.-pengő (one sextillion or 1021 pengő) were printed but never issued.|$|E

6000|$|Nevertheless, M.

[...] And M. Loucheur, the Minister of Industrial Reconstruction, stated before the Senate on the 17th February, 1919, that the reconstitution of the devastated regions would involve an expenditure of $15,000,000,000 (75 <b>milliard</b> francs),--more than double M. Pupin's estimate of the entire wealth of their inhabitants. But then at that time M. Loucheur was taking a prominent part in advocating the claims of France before the Peace Conference, and, like others, may have found strict veracity inconsistent with the demands of patriotism.[90] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{budgetary}} position of Italy {{is perhaps a}} little superior to that of France. Italian finance throughout the war was more enterprising than the French, and far greater {{efforts were made to}} impose taxation and pay for the war. Nevertheless Signor Nitti, the Prime Minister, in a letter addressed to the electorate {{on the eve of the}} General Election (Oct., 1919), thought it necessary to make public the following desperate analysis of the situation:--(1) The State expenditure amounts to about three times the revenue. (2) All the industrial undertakings of the State, including the railways, telegraphs, and telephones, are being run at a loss. Although the public is buying bread at a high price, that price represents a loss to the Government of about a <b>milliard</b> a year. (3) Exports now leaving the country are valued at only one-quarter or one-fifth of the imports from abroad. (4) The National Debt is increasing by about a <b>milliard</b> lire per month. (5) The military expenditure for one month is still larger than that for the first year of the war.|$|E
60|$|The Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1917, {{values the}} entire house {{property}} of France at $11,900,000,000 (59.5 <b>milliard</b> francs).[84] An estimate current in France of $4,000,000,000 (20 <b>milliard</b> francs) {{for the destruction of}} house property alone is, therefore, obviously wide of the mark.[85] $600,000,000 at pre-war prices, or say $1,250,000,000 at the present time, is much nearer the right figure. Estimates {{of the value of the}} land of France (apart from buildings) vary from $12,400,000,000 to $15,580,000,000, so that it would be extravagant to put the damage on this head as high as $500,000,000. Farm Capital for the whole of France has not been put by responsible authorities above $2,100,000,000.[86] There remain the loss of furniture and machinery, the damage to the coal-mines and the transport system, and many other minor items. But these losses, however serious, cannot be reckoned in value by hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of so small a part of France. In short, it will be difficult to establish a bill exceeding $2,500,000,000 for physical and material damage in the occupied and devastated areas of Northern France.[87] I am confirmed in this estimate by the opinion of M. René Pupin, the author of the most comprehensive and scientific estimate of the pre-war wealth of France,[88] which I did not come across until after my own figure had been arrived at. This authority estimates the material losses of the invaded regions at from $2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 (10 to 15 milliards),[89] between which my own figure falls half-way.|$|E
60|$|The {{statements}} of M. Dubois and M. Loucheur {{were made in}} the early spring of 1919. A speech delivered by M. Klotz before the French Chamber six months later (Sept. 5, 1919) was less excusable. In this speech the French Minister of Finance estimated the total French claims for damage to property (presumably inclusive of losses at sea, etc., but apart from pensions and allowances) at $26,800,000,000 (134 <b>milliard</b> francs), or more than six times my estimate. Even if my figure prove erroneous, M. Klotz's can never have been justified. So grave has been the deception practised on the French people by their Ministers that when the inevitable enlightenment comes, as it soon must (both as to their own claims and as to Germany's capacity to meet them), the repercussions will strike at more than M. Klotz, and may even involve the order of Government and Society for which he stands.|$|E
6000|$|In France {{the failure}} to impose {{taxation}} is notorious. Before the war the aggregate French and British budgets, and also the average taxation per head, were about equal; but in France no substantial effort {{has been made to}} cover the increased expenditure. [...] "Taxes increased in Great Britain during the war," [...] it has been estimated, [...] "from 95 francs per head to 265 francs, whereas the increase in France was only from 90 to 103 francs." [...] The taxation voted in France for the financial year ending June 30, 1919, was less than half the estimated normal post-bellum expenditure. The normal budget for the future cannot be put below $4,400,000,000 (22 <b>milliard</b> francs), and may exceed this figure; but even for the fiscal year 1919-20 the estimated receipts from taxation do not cover much more than half this amount. The French Ministry of Finance have no plan or policy whatever for meeting this prodigious deficit, except the expectation of receipts from Germany on a scale which the French officials themselves know to be baseless. In the meantime they are helped by sales of war material and surplus American stocks and do not scruple, even {{in the latter half of}} 1919, to meet the deficit by the yet further expansion of the note issue of the Bank of France.[153] ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is not an}} easy {{matter to}} come at the real cost of the kingly office in this country, all the {{expenditures}} of the European governments being mystified in such a way, as to require a very intimate knowledge of the details to give a perfectly clear account of them. But, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the charges that arise from this feature of the system do not fall much short, if indeed they do any, of eight millions of dollars annually. Out of this sum, however, the king pays the extra allowances of his guards, the war office taking the same view of all classes of soldiers, after distinguishing between foot and cavalry. You will get an idea of the luxury of royalty by a short account of the gardes du corps. These troops are all officers, the privates having the rank and receiving the pay of lieutenants. Their duty, as the name implies, is to have the royal person in their especial care, and there is always a guard of them in an ante-chamber of the royal apartments. They are heavy cavalry, and when they mount guard in the palaces, their arm is a carabine. A party of them always appear near the carriage of the king, or indeed near that of any of the reigning branch of the family. There are said to be four regiments or companies of them, of four hundred men each; but it strikes me the number must be exaggerated. I should think, however, that there are fully a thousand of them. In addition to these selected troops, there are three hundred Swiss, of the Swiss and royal guards; of the latter, including all arms, there must be many thousands. These are the troops that usually mount guard in and about all the palaces. The annual budget of France appears in the estimates at about a <b>milliard,</b> or a thousand millions of francs; but the usual mystifications are resorted to, and the truth will give the annual central expenses of the country at not less, I think, than two hundred millions of dollars. This sum, however, covers many items of expenditure, that we are accustomed to consider purely local. The clergy, for instance, are paid out of it, as is a portion of the cost of maintaining the roads. On the other hand, much money is collected, as a general regulation, that does not appear in the budget. Few or no churches are built, and there are charges for masses, interments, christenings, and fees for a hundred things, of which no account is taken in making out the sum total of the cost of government.|$|E
