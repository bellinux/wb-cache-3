5000|$|The Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> West Indian seal or sea wolf (as early explorers {{referred}} to it), Neomonachus tropicalis, was {{a species of}} seal native to the Caribbean and is now believed to be extinct.

[...] The last confirmed sighting of the Caribbean <b>Monk</b> <b>Seal</b> was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank, between Jamaica and Nicaragua. [...] In 2008 the species was officially declared extinct in the United States of America after an exhaustive search for the seals which lasted for about five years.

The {{total population of}} Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> is in decline - the larger population that inhabits the northwest islands is declining while the smaller population on the main Hawaiian Islands is increasing.

40|$|The {{endangered}} Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{has been}} undergoing dramatic population declines for several decades. These declines {{may be linked}} to food resources or environmental changes and this is reflected in the stable isotope analysis of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> The use of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope ratios on Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> bone collagen samples collected from 1912 through 2006 determined that changes within the environment and food web of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> may be factors contributing to the decrease in the population. Over the ninety-four year period the overall δ 15 N of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> was depleted by approximately 3 ‰ and the δ 13 C had minimal changes. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> located within the northern extent of the NWHI exhibited the most dramatic changes in stable isotopes. From 1923 through 2006 the δ 15 N of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> within this area was depleted nearly 6 ‰, while δ 13 C was enriched by 2 ‰. This significant depletion in δ 15 N, along with the enrichment within the δ 13 C for the northern NWHI could be caused by an increase in the primary productivity within the area, leading to a shorter food web. This inverse relationship within the northern NWHI could also be a representation of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> foraging more on benthic rather than pelagic prey, or foraging inshore rather than offshore in this region. This northern region was in contrast to the Central and southern islands within the NWHI. The central NWHI seals had nominal change in their δ 15 N and δ 13 C from 1912 to 2006; whereas, the southern NWHI seals exhibited a 3. 5 ‰ depletion in δ 15 N and a nearly 1 ‰ depletion in δ 13 C over the span from 1951 through 2006. Within the central NWHI the juvenile <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> were more depleted in δ 15 N as compared to the adult <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> which could indicate a prey base change for these seals. Within the southern NWHI {{there was a significant difference}} within δ 15 N and δ 13 C over the decades of the study which could indicate a decrease in the regional productivity. The adult <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> within the southern region also had an increase in δ 15 N which could be a indicator of starvation for the seals within this region. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes indicate modern <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> (2000 - 2006) foraged on a number of different teleost, crustacean, eel, and cephalopod species, correlating to earlier and current studies being conducted on the food sources of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
500|$|Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> had a {{relatively}} large, long, robust body, could grow to nearly [...] {{in length and}} weighed [...] Males were probably slightly larger than females, {{which is similar to}} Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Like other <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended broad muzzle. The face had relatively large wide-spaced eyes, upward opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long light-colored and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the more paler and yellowish younger <b>seals.</b> Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> were also known to have algae growing on their pelage, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{endangered}} Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> population {{contains about}} 1, 300 to 1, 400 seals, {{most of which}} occur in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Increasing reports of <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> sightings and births in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) since the mid- 1990 s indicates that seal numbers in this region may be growing (Baker and Johanos in review). Although higher numbers of <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> would ultimately {{reduce the risk of}} extinction, their occurrence in the MHI also raises a suite of new challenges for enhancing recovery of the species. There is a growing body of scientific knowledge on which to base management decisions for enhancing the recovery of <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Research activities have focused on four general categories: population dynamics, biology, foraging ecology, and health/disease. Most of the available information has been collected in the NWHI, and although relatively little is known about seals in the MHI, inferences can be made from the available information to direct conservation and protection efforts.

Together they produced a static mass balance model for 1998 when the prey surveys began. The Ecopath-estimated <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> biomass was 0. 0045 t/km 2, which was in close agreement with the biomass calculated from <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> field beach counts (0. 0046 t/km 2).

40|$|Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{abundance}} {{is currently}} declining by about 4 % per year with current population estimates around 1, 100 individuals. Although the overall population continues to decline, a small sub-population {{in the main}} Hawaiian Islands (MHI) appears to be increasing by roughly 6 % per year. <b>Monk</b> <b>seal</b> conservation and recovery efforts in the MHI have been hindered by the perception that seals do not belong there, and that they compete with fisheries and damage coral reefs. Education and outreach efforts describing the actual impact of <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> in the MHI are currently underway, but we actually {{know very little about}} their at-sea behavior, especially in the MHI, even though Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> have been studied extensively since the 1980 s. The central objective of my dissertation was to describe <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> behavior and develop a baseline for <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> foraging ecology and habitat use in the MHI. To accomplish this I combined three-axis accelerometers, National Geographic Crittercams, and GPS tags to study <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> foraging behavior. I instrumented 16 seals between 2010 and 2014 on the islands of Molokai, Kauai, and Oahu and deployed an additional 24 GPS tags without the accelerometer and Crittercam. I recovered each Crittercam/accelerometer package 3 - 6 days after deployment, resulting in an average of 6. 14 hours of video footage per seal. The GPS tags continued to record data for 3 - 6 months providing long-term summaries of dive and haul-out behavior. Using a Bayesian framework I modeled <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> behavior and habitat use, and developed a method to identify feeding events from accelerometer data. There was a high level of individual variation in the movements of <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> but general descriptions of their behavior were accurate at the population level. On average, foraging trips lasted 0. 81 ± 1. 38 days and seals traveled 28. 45 ± 82. 03 km per trip. Most seals began benthic dives shortly after entering the water, with most dives occurring between 20 - 40 m. I used kernel density estimation to define the 50 % (core area) and 95 % (home range) utilization distribution for each seal. The median home range and core area size for seals in the MHI was 265. 62 km 2 and 1, 564. 56 km 2, respectively. The pitch axis of the accelerometer was a reliable metric, with over 70 % accuracy, for identifying foraging events for <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Body motion {{over the course of a}} dive, and how close the seal was to the seafloor during a dive (dive ratio) were the best predictors of these foraging events. Consequently, dive ratio was used to infer foraging in long-term telemetry records that lacked concurrent accelerometer data. Analysis of these data relative to habitat preferences revealed two distinct movement modes for <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> in the MHI: near shore and offshore/inter-island. My research developed the first thorough understanding of <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> movements and habitat use in the MHI and provided insight into the mechanisms contributing to the behavioral variability observed for this species. I hope that a detailed understanding of the foraging behavior of <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> will provide insight into their true role in the ecosystem and help foster the recovery of this critically endangered species.
