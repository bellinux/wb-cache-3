2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Indian Army HQ {{had decided to}} acquire new-generation {{replacements}} for its UK-origin fleet of Royal Ordnance Factories-built Centurion and Vijayanta MBTs, {{which are based on}} the licensed production of the Vickers MBT, and consequently, paper evaluations concerning the firepower and mobility characteristics of the two principal contenders being offered for full in-country production—AMX-40 developed by GIAT Industries of France, and the Chieftain 800 (which later evolved into the Challenger 1 from Royal Ordnance Factories (then owned by British Aerospace PLC)—were conducted by the Indian Army. Between these two contenders, the Army had by early 1980 zeroed in on the 43-tonne AMX-40 MBT, which was still on the drawing boards and was meant to be powered by a 1,100hp Poyaud V12X 12-cylinder diesel engine coupled with a LSG-3000 automatic power shift transmission built by RENK Aktiengesellschaft of Germany (offering a power-to-weight ratio of 25.6hp/tonne, and armed with a 120mm smoothbore cannon. However, AMX-40 has only marginal protection by the standards of 1980's. After coming back to power, the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi requested additional evaluation, including MBTs from the USSR, following which the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (which after 1991 morphed into Oboronexport, then Rosoboronservice and ultimately Rosoboronexport State Corp) made a formal offer to India's Ministry of Defence (MoD) for supplying the [...] 37-tonne T-72M Ob'yekt 172M-E4 MBT off-the-shelf, and according an approval for licensed-production of the 41.5-tonne T-72M-1982 Ob'yekt 172M-E6 to the MoD-owned Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) in Avadi. By early 1981, two T-72Ms—powered by a 780hp diesel engine, armed with 125mm 2A46M smoothbore gun and offering a power-to-weight ratio of 20hp/tonne, were subjected to an exhaustive series of in-country firepower and mobility trials by the Army. After review of trial results, T-72M and T-72-1982 (powered by a Model V-84MS four-stroke 12-cylinder <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> developing 840hp and offering a power-to-weight ratio of 18.8hp/tone) were selected as Army’s future MBTs, and a procurement contract for 2,418 T-72s was subsequently inked.|$|E

It was located in Freising, a town near Munich. In 1910, new buildings were constructed by the architects Jakob Heilmann and Max Littmann. After one more year, Schlüter built a test area, the so-called Schlüterhof.|$|R

Due to the cylinder linings being pressure fitted, coolant leaks within the cylinder block were common, resulting in white smoke billowing from the exhaust.|$|R

50|$|The Gepard {{is based}} on a {{slightly}} modified chassis of the Leopard 1 main battle tank, including the complete drive unit with a 37.4-liter 10-cylinder <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> (type: MB 838 CaM 500) with two mechanical superchargers built by MTU. The V-engine with a cylinder angle of 90 degrees has 610 kW at 2200 RPM (830 PS) and consumes, depending on the surface and driving style, around 150 liters per 100 kilometers. To ensure a steady supply of oil, even in difficult terrain and under extreme skew, the engine is provided with a dry sump forced lubrication. Even the gearbox (type: 4 HP-250) from ZF Friedrichshafen and the exhaust system with fresh air admixture to reduce the infrared signature were taken from the Leopard 1 MBT.|$|E

50|$|The Bedford MK/MJ - a 4x4 {{variant of}} the TK - was used in large numbers by the British Armed Forces and others. The Bedford MK was {{introduced}} to replace the Bedford RL. It was very successful and, by year end 1977, a total of 11,700 units had been produced for the British Army and overseas military services. The MK/MJ was produced in many variants. From April 1981, Bedford changed the designation of the MK to MJ as the K <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> was superseded by the J diesel engine.

50|$|One large {{use of a}} {{military}} <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> was the LD series used in the US M35 -ton and M54 5-ton trucks built between 1963 and 1970. A military standard design using M.A.N. technology, {{it was able to}} use different fuels without preparation. Its primary fuel was Diesel #1, #2, or AP, but 70% to 90% of other fuels could be mixed with diesel, depending on how smooth the engine would run. Low octane commercial and aviation gasoline could be used if motor oil was added, jet fuel Jet A, B, JP-4, 5, 7, and 8 could be used, in an emergency fuel oil #1 and #2 could be used. In practice, they only used diesel fuel, their tactical advantage was never needed, and in time they were replaced with commercial diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|The Gepard is also {{equipped}} with a Daimler-Benz (type: OM 314) 4-cylinder diesel auxiliary engine for the energy supply system. This engine is on the front left of the vehicle, located where the Leopard 1 has an ammunition magazine. The engine, which has a 3.8 liter capacity, is designed as a <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> and produces 66 kW (90 PS). It consumes, depending on the operational status of the tank, between 10 and 20 liters per hour (l/h). The auxiliary engine is coupled with five generators to operate at different speeds: Two Metadyn machines in tandem with a flywheel (which is used to store energy during the acceleration and deceleration of the turret) for {{the power of the}} elevation and traverse drives, two 380-Hz three-phase generators with a capacity of 20 kVA for the ventilation, fire control and radar systems, and a 300-A 28-volt direct current generator for the electrical system.
