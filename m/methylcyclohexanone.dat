40|$|Candida {{antarctica}} lipase B, immobilized as {{cross linked}} enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) {{was used to}} mediate the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone to epsilon-caprolactone, and the reaction was compared with the one using Novozym (R) 435 as catalyst. The conversion was dependent on the initial concentration of cyclohexanone, and was about 90 % after 48 h at concentrations of up to 0. 25 M but was decreased at higher concentrations. Caprolactone concentrations up to 0. 6 M {{had no effect on}} the reaction efficiency. Among the cyclic ketones tested, the highest degree of conversion was achieved for cyclopentanone (88 %) and the lowest for cyclooctanone (about 2 %). The effect of methyl substitution and position of substitution on the cycloketone was studied using <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> and it has shown to influence the conversion efficiency. Both hydrogen peroxide and the reaction by-product acetic acid had a deleterious effect on the stability of the biocatalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{properties of}} the host, trans- 9, 10 -dihydroxy- 9, 10 -diphenyl- 9, 10 - dihydroanthracene, with various guest molecules, namely cyclohexanone, 2 - <b>methylcyclohexanone,</b> 3 -methylcyclohexanone and 4 -methylcyclohexanone, were investigated. The host to guest ratios were determined by programmed temperature thermogravimetry. Two of the four molecular structures were elucidated using single crystal X-ray diffraction. All the inclusion compounds were also characterised by differential scanning calorimetry, hotstage microscopy and Xray powder diffraction. The kinetics of decomposition of the inclusion compound containing the guest cyclohexanone were studied using different experimental techniques under isothermal conditions: these were the quartz microbalance, the levitating balance and isothermal thermogravimetry. The kinetics of decomposition {{of the other three}} compounds were studied by means of isothermal thermogravimetry. The Arrhenius parameters determined showed a compensation effect between the activation energies and pre-exponential factors. Competition experiments were performed to determine the selectivity of the host for the four guest substances...|$|E

The title compound, C 12 H 13 ClO 2, was {{prepared}} by the direct asymmetric intermolecular aldol reaction of cyclopentanone and 4 -chlorobenzaldehyde catalysed by l-tryptophan in water. The absolute molecular structure {{was determined to be}} a racemic twin with 91 % (2 R, 3 R) isomer and 9 % of the (2 S, 3 S) form. In the crystal structure, the molecules are connected into a one-dimensional chain along the a axis through the formation of intermolecular O—H O hydrogen bonds. Further, non-conventional C—H O and C—H contacts are observed in the structure, which consolidate the crystal packing.

40|$|The {{hydrogenation}} of {{a number}} of unsaturated compounds containing carbon-oxygen bonds has been studied. In most cases the reactions were performed at 30 C and one atmosphere pressure of hydrogen, over Adams platinum oxide catalyst, in 50 ml. of a solvent, usually containing some acid. It has been concluded from the results obtained that :- (1). Hydrogenolysis of the carbon-oxygen bond is always prevalent when acid or acidified solvents are used with a substrate having a centre of unsaturation close to the carbon-oxygen link. Thus under these conditions phenols, benzyl alcohols, allylic alcohols and cyclohexanones cleave readily. Removal of the centre of unsaturation from the vicinity of the carbon-oxygen bond renders it less liable to hydrogenolysis, as shown by the considerably smaller cleavage of ?-phenyl ethyl alcohol. The kinetics of the hydrogenolysis of phenols and benzyl alcohols show marked similarities with the kinetics of the hydrogenolysis of the corresponding phenyl and benzyl chlorides and quaternary ammonium salts. In the case of phenols only small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons are observable in the liquid phase during hydrogenolysis, in contrast to the case of chlorobenzene and trimethylphenyl ammonium chloride where cleavage leads to large amounts of benzene appearing in the liquid phase. In all the examples studied very little hydrogenolysis takes place in neutral or weakly basic solutions, and the proportion of hydrogenolysis is affected by the amount and acid strength of the acid used. (2). Addition of hydrogen to the unsaturation, producing the saturated alcohol, is also observed for all the oxygenated compounds tried, {{and in the absence of}} acid this appears to be the major reaction. Of particular interest is the case of phenols where the reduction of the aromatic ring is shown to be, to some extent, a two stage process. Cyclohexanone has been shown to be an intermediate in the reaction. An attempt has been made to estimate the extent of this two stage mechanism by interception of the cyclohexanone with semicarbazide, and by examination of the proportions of cis- and trans- methylcyclo- hexanols from ortho-, meta- and para-cresols and from the corresponding <b>methylcyclohexanones.</b> Addition of other aromatic molecules (e. g. benzene, toluene) and cyclohexene reduces the rate of the reduction of phenol, benzyl alcohol and cyclohexanones. Substituents in the ring of these compounds also led to smaller rates of reduction, the effect being qualitatively similar for both hydrogenolysis and addition reactions. The reduction of phenols and cyclohexanones in acidic methanol leads to the formation of cyclo-hexyl methyl ethers. The overall reactions are first order with respect to hydrogen pressure and weight of catalyst, and zero order with respect to the substrate concentration...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy (STM) {{and temperature}} programmed desorption (TPD) measurements {{have revealed that}} the straight step edges of Cu(5 3 3) surfaces are reconstructed by the room temperature adsorption of R- 3 - <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> (R- 3 -MCHO). STM and {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED) investigations have shown that the clean Cu(5 3 3) surface is composed of arrays of narrow (1 1 1) terraces separated by straight (1 0 0) steps. During room temperature adsorption of R- 3 -MCHO, the (1 0 0) step edges on the Cu(5 3 3) surface reconstruct, adopting a zigzag structure that exposes kinked, high Miller index step edges. The density of step edge and kink adsorption sites on Cu surfaces can be titrated by TPD of R- 3 -MCHO. TPD experiments also reveal the formation of kinks on the Cu(5 3 3) surface during room temperature adsorption of R- 3 -MCHO. Furthermore, TPD experiments on the Cu(2 2 1) surface having straight (1 1 0) step edges indicate that these also reconstruct to expose kinked step edges during R- 3 - MCHO adsorption at room temperature. Although the kinks on such surfaces are chiral, the R- and S-forms appear to be produced in a roughly racemic (equimolar) ratio. Thus, although the reconstruction of the initially achiral Cu surfaces {{in the presence of a}} chiral adsorbate could, in principle, lead to a surface with a net chiral structure, R- 3 - MCHO does not seem to be an effective chiral imprinting agent...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} find {{substrate}} specificity and enantioselectivity of ketoreductase domain (EryKR 1) in the first module of polyketide synthase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the whole cells of recombinant Escherichia coli BL 21 (pET-eryKR 1) 2 harboring eryKR 1 gene fermented with different kinds of cyclohexanone derivatives such as <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> and cyclohexanedione. Gas Chromatography （GC）or Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrum (GC-MS) analyses of these ferments indicate that when the recombinant cells were employed as biocatalysts, only one carbonyl of 1, 2 -cyclohexanedione and 1, 4 -cyclohexanedione could be reduced with the conversion rate 20. 44 % and 6. 03 %, respectively. In addition, 2 -methylcyclohexanone and 3 -methylcyclohexanone except 4 -methylcyclohexanone could be significantly turned over by the recombinant cells to their corresponding cis-methylcyclohexanols, of which the conversion rate of 40 mM 2 -methylcyclohexanone was 12. 2 % and enantiomeric excess of cis- 2 -methylcyclohexanol was 57. 98 %, and the conversion rate of 10 mM 3 -methylcyclohexanone was 38. 26 % and enantiomeric excess of cis- 3 -methylcyclohexanol was 53. 9 %. Furthermore, the unexpected reduction of 1, 2 -cyclohexanedione and 2 -chlorocyclohexanone by the control E. coli BL 21 (pET- 28 a) reveals that the attracting electron effect induced by the carbonyl or chlorin group in their ortho position could make some NAD(P) H-dependent oxo-reductase except EryKR 1 domain within the recombinants reduce the carbonyl of 1, 2 -cyclohexanedione and 2 -chlorocyclohexanone. Therefore, it is concluded that 1, 4 -cyclohexanedione, 2 -methylcyclohexanone and 3 -methylcyclohexanone except 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione and 4 -methylcyclohexanone are accepted substrates of EryKR 1 domain which takes on a certain biocatalyst activity and stereospecificity...|$|E
40|$|For the {{ultimate}} purpose of preparing analogues of the Chinese antimalarial qinghaosu (artemisinin), {{the scope and}} application of the cationic Diels-Alder reactions between substituted 3, 5 -dienol trimethylsilyl ethers and cyclic enones have been evaluated. (2 E, 4 E) - 2, 4 -Hexadienoic acid was converted into the methyl ester, and deconjugated with LDA, and reduced to the alcohol (3 E) - 3, 5 -hexadienol. Each of (2 R, 3 E, 5 E) - and (2 S, 3 E, 5 E) - 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -heptadien- 1 -ol were prepared from the respective enantiomers of 3 -bromo- 2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol via conversion into the corresponding phosphonium salts, and reaction with (E) - 2 -butenal (crotonaldehyde); the alcohols were obtained as an inseparable 4 : 1 mixture of E and Z isomers. Each of (2 R, 3 E, 5 Z) - and (2 R, 3 Z, 5 Z) - 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -heptadien- 1 -ol were prepared from 2 -butyn- 1 -ol via reduction and then conversion to (Z) - 1 -brormobut- 2 -ene and conversion of the latter into crystalline (Z) -(but- 2 -enyl) diphenylphosphine oxide which was crystallized to geometric purity. Reaction of the phosphine oxide with (2 S) - 3 -[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) oxy]- 2 -methylpropionaldehyde and hydrolysis of the product gave (2 R, 5 Z) - 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -heptadien- 1 -ol as a 14 : 1 mixture of 3 E and 3 Z isomers. (2 R, 3 E) -and (2 R, 3 Z) - 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -hexadien- 1 -ol were prepared as a 4 : 1 mixture from [(2 S) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpropyl] triphenylphosphonium bromide and acrolein with a Wittig reaction. The Wittig-Horner reaction was also used to prepare this diene from allyl diphenylphosphine oxide and (S) - 3 -[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) oxy]- 2 -methylpropanal. The alcohols were each converted into their trimethylsilyl ethers. 6 -Methyl- 2 -cyclohexenone was prepared from <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> by bromination of the kinetic silyl enol ether, and dehydrobromination of the resulting 2 -bromo- 6 -methylcyclohexanone. 2 -Methyl- 2 -cyclohexenone was prepared from <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> by chlorination with sulfuryl chloride, and dehydrochlorination with magnesium oxide. The above dienes and enones were submitted in the Diels-Alder reaction by reacting in acetonitrile and {{in the presence of}} the catalyst trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate. Thereby preparing a series of adducts as full acetals in varying yields, depending upon the substitution pattern of the diene. In general, yields were higher if the alkenes did not bear a terminal substituent. Structures of the adducts were established by hydrolysis to hemiacetals, as careful analysis by NMR spectroscopy, and in some cases, by X-ray crystallography. It was not possible to obtain unambiguous structural information from the adducts obtained from 2 -methycyclohex- 2 -enone and 2 -methylcyclopent- 2 -enone, as these products, or the hemiacetals obtained from them by hydrolysis, were unable to be crystallized. Whilst the outcome of the Diels-Alder reactions of 6 -methylcyclohexenone with each of (2 R, 3 E, 5 E) - and (2 S, 3 E, 5 E) - 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -heptadien- 1 -ol TMS ethers were highly stereoselective, the reactions of the corresponding terminally-unsubstituted dienes were not so selective, and the stereochemistry of the adducts obtained indicates that the dienes react with the enone from both the Si- and Re-faces via an endo transition state. The use of the Diels-Alder reaction is illustrated in the preparation of (4 a'RS, 8 'SR, 8 a'RS) - 2 -(2 '-methyl- 3 ', 4 ', 4 a', 5 ', 6 ', 7 ', 8 ', 8 a'-octahydronaphthalen- 8 '-yl) -acetic acid from 1 SR, 2 SR, 4 aSR, 8 RS, 8 aRS) - 8 -(1 '-hydroxyethan- 2 '-yl) - 2 -methyl- 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 a, 5, 8, 8 a-octahydro- 1 -naphthol.

40|$|The {{performance}} at cold start of spark-ignited car engines {{is still a}} challenge since slow and incomplete vaporization of the fuel causes high emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and may even cause difficulties to start at very low temperatures, in particular with alternative fuels such as ethanol. One approach to improve fuel evaporation is by direct injection into the cylinder late during the compression stroke. In this study the evaporation of fuel, including selective evaporation of fuel components of different volatility, has been studied, in sprays injected into air with a controlled pressure and temperature. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and Mie scattering were used to image the fuel distribution in vapor and liquid phase in a cross-section of sprays. A model fuel of non-fluorescent molecules was used and a fluorescent tracer molecule was added. To simulate a fuel with a distillation curve similar to gasoline a multi-component model fuel was selected. The fuel was composed of five iso- or cyclo-alkenes with boiling points that span the 30 - 190 °C range. As fluorescence tracers ketones: acetone, 3 -pentanone and <b>methylcyclohexanone,</b> were used to trace light, medium-heavy and heavy fuel fractions. Besides investigating the gasoline-like model fuel, ethanol and an etha-nol/multi-components fuel blend were investigated. Spray imaging {{was carried out in}} a pressurized chamber. The injector was an outward-opening piezo-actuated injector generating a hollow-cone spray. A cross-section of the spray was illuminated by laser light at a wavelength of 266 nm formed into a thin sheet. Two intensified CCD-cameras were used to detect fluorescence and scattered light. The presence and penetration of liquid was determined by detecting Mie-scattered light. The PLIF-images provided the total distribution of fuel in liquid and vapor phase, and by comparing with the Mie-images it could be determined when the vapor started to appear in areas with little or no drops present indicating the presence of fuel vapor. It was found that at 90 °C the light fuel components evaporated quickly, the medium-heavy components slowly while the heavy ones remained in liquid phase. At 140 °C also the medium-heavy components evaporate relatively rapidly...|$|E
