5|$|While {{the cluster}} of {{thunderstorms}} was tracking through Missouri, {{a new line of}} thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, demarcating a dry line boundary. Although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes, these storms tracked eastward into southwestern <b>Missouri</b> <b>and</b> eventually produced several tornadoes. A long-tracked EF3 developed from one of these supercells and struck Cincinnati, Arkansas. At 13:31UTC on December31, a tornado watch was issued for much of <b>Missouri</b> <b>and</b> portions of Arkansas and Illinois. Most of the tornadoes during the outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through <b>Missouri</b> <b>and</b> Illinois throughout the day. At around noon, a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Although these storms were initially weak, they gradually intensified into supercells as the day went on. Additional supercells quickly developed over Louisiana and eventually spread in coverage over Mississippi, resulting in the development of several tornadoes. Reaching their peak strength over Mississippi, the storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on December31 and into January1, 2011. By the morning hours of January1, severe activity had become restricted to the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama; the last tornado watch issued in association with the 2010New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15:56UTC that day.|$|E
