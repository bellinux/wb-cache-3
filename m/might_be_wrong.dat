25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing I <b>Might</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Wrong</b> in 2001, Matt LeMay of Pitchfork {{wrote that}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] is [...] "absolutely {{gorgeous}} ... it can hold its own against any song on OK Computer." [...] He {{felt that the}} song, along {{with the performance of}} [...] "Like Spinning Plates", [...] "justified the existence" [...] of the EP. Ted Kessler of the NME praised Yorke's vocals as [...] "clear and true". Nicholas Taylor of PopMatters praised the song as [...] "a bittersweet victory of love" [...] which [...] "shows that behind all of Radiohead's modernist nightmares is a fragile, desperate desire to connect, fully and meaningfully, with just one person." ...|$|E
500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
2500|$|As one U.S. Muslim {{observer}} noted: [...] "People {{forgot about}} Saddam's record {{and concentrated on}} America... Saddam Hussein <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> {{but it is not}} America who should correct him." [...] A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period [...] "from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation." ...|$|E
50|$|Example: If someone's {{reputation}} was portrayed in a false light during a personnel performance evaluation {{in a government}} agency or public university, one <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wronged</b> if {{only a small number}} initially learned of it, or if adverse recommendations were made to only a few superiors (by a peer committee to department chair, dean, dean's advisory committee, provost, president, etc.). Settled cases suggest false light may not be effective in private school personnel cases, but they may be distinguishable from cases arising in public institutions.|$|R

2500|$|Alcibiades {{thought at}} the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him {{everything}} he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates [...] "as if I were the lover and he my young prey!" [...] (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).|$|E
2500|$|Lessig {{has long}} been known to be a {{supporter}} of net neutrality. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify Michael Powell's four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, [...] "Now, no doubt, my position <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) {{described}} Umm Burj as: [...] "A ruined village, with {{a central}} tower; apparently not ancient; caves and cisterns round it, and a well." [...] Khalidi believed that the SWP assumption that the tower <b>was</b> not ancient <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|R

60|$|Josie {{lowered the}} revolver. Her face was red. She was {{beginning}} to wonder if she had bungled the case.

60|$|Mrs General, having {{long ago}} formed her own surface to such {{perfection}} that it hid whatever was below it (if anything), no observation {{was to be}} made in that quarter.

60|$|Here, an end. I {{hope you}} will write to me some day, and ease me by proving to me that I have ceased to be bitter to the palate of your soul. Believe this--that, rather than be a serious sadness to you, I would gladly sit on in the pillory under the {{aggressive}} mud of that mob of 'Saturday Reviewers,' who take their mud and their morals from the same place, and use voices hoarse with hooting down un-English poetesses, to cheer on the English champion, Tom Sayers. For me, I neither wish for the 'belt'[78] nor martyrdom; but if I were ambitious of anything, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> to <b>be</b> <b>wronged</b> where, for instance, Cavour <b>is</b> <b>wronged.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I came up," [...] I explained, [...] "because I {{saw your}} {{lights in the}} windows, and I bought that {{something}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> I am very glad I did so, since it has given me the chance of making the general's acquaintance." ...|$|E

60|$|The happy captain {{thought it}} full {{time to go}} away somewhere.

30|$|The {{algorithms}} {{for classifying}} learning curves could be refined to detect outliers among the KCs. We believe KCs {{with a high}} number of opportunities needed to master them should be further investigated to understand why those particular skills are so difficult to master. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> something <b>wrong</b> with the instruction. Even if there <b>is</b> nothing <b>wrong,</b> those skills have the largest potential of improvement in our goal to make learning as efficient as possible.|$|R
50|$|His {{reliance}} on the current 'conventional wisdom' leaves him open to criticism. We <b>might</b> all <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> Collecting evidence on people's deep held but rarely scrutinised beliefs about justice is notoriously difficult and unreliable. His argument for multiple rationales for justice comes in part from his belief in cultural pluralism (there are no universally shared beliefs) but theorists such as Franz Oppenheimer dispute this.|$|R
50|$|ConversionAbout Christmas 1757, Berridge began {{thinking}} that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> preaching <b>wrong</b> doctrine. He <b>was</b> “musing upon a text of Scripture” when what seemed to him “like a voice from heaven” said, “Cease from thine own works.” By this epiphany, he realized that his former belief that his salvation depended partly through his works, and “partly through Christ’s mercies” <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Now he <b>was</b> assured that his salvation depended solely on Christ’s mercies, to wit, that he was “justified by faith” and that “sanctification follows after justification”.|$|R

60|$|It really appeared, {{before that}} long night {{had come to}} an end, as if every officer in the fort {{suspected}} something <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> and, what seemed yet more strange to me, they all came directly to our post, instead of visiting those sentinels who, if the savages had really cut loose from St. Leger, should have been in the best positions to hear or see the first signs of the expected assault.|$|E

50|$|At {{this point}} the bombsight now has an {{accurate}} measurement of the true motion of the aircraft.
