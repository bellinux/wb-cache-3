Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.|$|E

40|$|Applications of the variance-covariance {{technique}} {{are presented}} that illustrate {{the potential of}} the method. The dose <b>mean</b> lineal <b>energy,</b> yD, can be determined in time-varying radiation fields where the fluctuations of the dose rate are substantially in excess of the stochastic fluctuations of the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted.</b> An added advantage is, that yD is little influenced by noise that affects both detectors simultaneously. The variance-covariance method is thus stable with respect to dose rate fluctuations and other temporal variations of a radiation field, and to various influences of noise and electronic artefacts. The dose <b>mean</b> lineal <b>energy</b> obtained at different simulated diameters agrees well with experimental data by other authors and can be determined for small simulated diameters (below 100 nm). ...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{therapy with}} protons and ions is gaining {{popularity}} {{all over the}} world, because of the physical and biological advances with respect to photon, electron and neutron radiotherapy. At present, sixty-four therapeutic centers worldwide use particle beams to treat their patients. Most of them use fast protons beams and ten centers (3 in Europe, 5 in Japan and 2 in China) use carbon ions. A definite model of radiation action on living cells is still unestablished, however {{it is known that}} the “quantity” of radiation, characterized by the absorbed dose (the <b>mean</b> <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> to matter per unit mass) is not sufficient to characterize the biological effect, in that equal doses of different radiations lead to different results. Sparsely ionizing radiations, like gamma rays, are less effective than densely ionizing radiations, like slow protons and carbon ions; the capability of ionizing radiation to damage a living cell is indeed closely related to the local energy deposition within relevant subcellular structures, like the chromosomes. An accurate treatment planning should therefore take into account the particle interactions at the micrometer level. To this respect, microdosimetry offers a valuable technique, by measuring the stochastics of energy deposition in small volumes of approximately 1 m size. Tissue-equivalent gas proportional counters (TEPC) are the reference devices. A miniaturized TEPC has been build at the Legnaro National Laboratories of LNL, to cope with high intensity therapeutic beams used at the Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO) of Pavia. The objective of this thesis is to study in detail the working characteristics of this mini-TEPC, with the aim to design a novel simplified microdosimeter optimized for the clinical environment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a deterministic model of frequency distributions for <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> (total <b>energy</b> deposition) in small volumes similar to DNA molecules from high-energy ions {{of interest for}} space radiation protection and cancer therapy. Frequency distributions for <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> are useful for considering radiation quality and for modeling biological damage produced by ionizing radiation. For high-energy ions, secondary electron (delta-ray) tracks originating from a primary ion track make dominant contributions to energy deposition events in small volumes. Our method uses the distribution of electrons produced about an ion's path and incorporates results from Monte Carlo simulation of electron tracks to predict frequency distributions for ions, including their dependence on radial distance. The contribution from primary ion events is treated using an impact parameter formalism of spatially restricted linear energy transfer (LET) and energy-transfer straggling. We validate our model by comparing it directly to results from Monte Carlo simulations for proton and alpha-particle tracks. We show {{for the first time}} frequency distributions of <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> in DNA structures by several high-energy ions such as cosmic-ray iron ions.

40|$|Dose as {{a result}} of {{radiation}} exposure is the notion generally used to disclose the <b>imparted</b> <b>energy</b> in a volume of tissue to a potential biological effect. The basic unit defined by the international system of units (SI system) is the radiation absorbed dose, which is expressed as the <b>mean</b> <b>imparted</b> <b>energy</b> in a mass element of the tissue known as "gray" (Gy) or J/kg. The procedure for ascertaining the absorbed dose is complicated since it involves the radiation transport of numerous types of charged particles and coupled photon interactions. The most precise method is to perform a full 3 D Monte Carlo simulation of the radiation transport. There are various Monte Carlo toolkits that have tool compartments for dose calculations and measurements. The dose studies in this thesis were performed using the GEANT 4 Application for Emission Tomography (GATE) software (Janet al., 2011) GATE simulation toolkit has been used extensively in the medical imaging community, {{due to the fact that}} it uses the full capabilities of GEANT 4. It also utilizes an easy to-learn GATE macro language, which is more accessible than learning the GEANT 4 /C++ programming language. This work combines GATE with digital phantoms generated using the NCAT (NURBS-based cardiac-torso phantom) toolkit (Segars et al., 2004) to allow efficient and effective estimation of 3 D radiation dose maps. The GATE simulation tool has developed into a beneficial tool for Monte Carlo simulations involving both radiotherapy and imaging experiments. This work will present an overview of absorbed dose of common radionuclides used in nuclear medicine and serve as a guide to a user who is setting up a GATE simulation for a PET and SPECT study...|$|R

However the results depend critically upon the initial masses and excitation energies of the primary projectile fragments. In this respect, the three-body approach underestimates the excitation <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> to the primary fragments whereas the two-body scenario overestimates it.

40|$|This {{report is}} a logical {{continuation}} of two papers concerning basic concepts in dosimetry. The first paper (1) is u critical analysis of the concepts of ionizing radiation and <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> {{as defined by the}} ICRU (2). The second paper (3) gives a definition of the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted,</b> the fundamental quantity in radiation dosimetry, which is equivalent to that given by the ICRU but which has a different form. This alternative definition of the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> is suitable in deriving a general expression, in terms of particle fluences and interaction cross sections, for the absorbed dose valid also in situations where no kind of radiation equilibrium is established. It is, however, today not possible to quantify this expression for the absorbed dose. All practical calculations of absorbed dose rely on the assumption of one or another type of radiation equilibrium. The aim of this work is to analyze different kinds of radiation equilibrium conditions and to find the corresponding exact expressions for the absorbed dose. The concept of radiation equilibrium is more carefully analyzed than has been done previously (4, 5, 6). Moreover, the definition of the mass energy absorption coefficient for indirectly (uncharged) ionizing particles is critically analyzed. A new definition is proposed relevant to calculations of the absorbed dose in cases when charged particle equilibrium exists within a homogeneous medium due to the uniform liberation of charged particles, by uncharged particles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{consequence}} of generation of dense electronic excitation along {{the paths of}} energetic heavy ions is discussed, emphasizing the fates of electron–hole pairs. It is pointed out that {{a substantial part of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> to electron–hole pairs in the materials in which excitons are self-trapped is converted directly to defect formation energy but do not contribute to heating. However, the thermal spike model can be an appropriate macroscopic model of the track registration of the materials in which excitons are self-trapped, because energy deposited to the material remains along the ion paths. The <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> to electron–hole pairs is diffused away from the ion paths in the materials in which excitons are not self-trapped. This explains the reason why the critical stopping power for track registration is higher in these materials.

40|$|The cavity theory by Spencer and Attix {{treats the}} energy {{deposition}} in a Bragg-Gray (B-G) cavity (detector). Originally the theory {{was developed for}} {{the case of a}} B-G detector inside a medium irradiated with photons and assuming electronic equilibrium in the medium at the position of the cavity. The theory is also applicable in media irradiated with other types of uncharged ionizing particles (e. g., neutrons) and charged particles such as electrons and protons. The special case of photon irradiation under CPE (charged particle equilibrium) conditions was coupled to a model for calculating the energy spectrum of the equilibrium fluence of electrons in the undisturbed medium. For other situations, e. g., in a medium externally irradiated with electrons, the problem is to evaluate the energy spectrum of the electron fluence at the point considered in the medium. Today, this is mostly accomplished using Monte Carlo simulations.
