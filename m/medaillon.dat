25|$|Malayer carpets sre {{distinguished}} by their single-weft {{and the use}} of the symmetrical knot. Allover and <b>medaillon</b> patterns are common, the boteh motif is frequently used.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Sarouk {{design was}} distinguished by a round-star <b>medaillon</b> with surrounding pendants. The traditional {{design of the}} Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours. Feraghan carpets are less finely woven thsn Sarouk. Often the Herati pattern is seen all over. Medaillons, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.|$|E
25|$|Tabriz is {{the market}} {{center for the}} Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the {{symmetric}} knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large <b>medaillon,</b> less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the initial Epaulettes series {{inspired}} the introduction of three new varieties with different designs and denominations in October 1849. These new types replaced the epaulettes design with the so-called [...] "Medallion" [...] (<b>Médaillon)</b> type, featuring Leopold I's portrait within a circular medallion window. In the same issue, a new denomination of forty centimes in red was produced for overseas mail. It was rumoured {{at the time that}} Leopold I did not like the design at the time, and believed that the epaulettes gave him a childlike aspect. The Epaulettes were officially superseded in 1859, but remained legally valid until 1 July 1866 when, following Leopold I's death, all stamps bearing his effigy were demonetised.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} {{was designed by}} Hráský, with {{the ceiling of the}} main hall decorated with <b>medaillons</b> by the painters Janez and Jurij Šubic. These were created in 1885. Janez Šubic drew the main allegorical painting of Carniola as the protector of arts and sciences, whereas Jurij Šubic drew four portraits of famous Carniolans: Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, Valentin Vodnik, Sigmund Herberstein and Sigmund Zois. The painting by Janez was made with oil on wood, whereas the portraits were made with oil on fresh plaster. The painters followed the proposals of their teacher Janez Wolf. The space between the <b>medaillons</b> was decorated by Karel Lipovšek.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Deventer and but was trained in Antwerp as an {{engraver}} and painter who worked in Paris with {{the master of the}} <b>Médaillons</b> Historiques. He is registered in Rome in 1530, in Antwerp in 1533, and in Fontainebleau from 1535 onwards. He died in Antwerp.|$|R
2500|$|Design {{elements}} {{may also}} be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a medallion, a symmetrical pattern occupying {{the center of the}} field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common Persian [...] "Lechek Torūnj" [...] (<b>medaillon</b> and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental book illuminations in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug {{may also be}} broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.|$|E
2500|$|Apparently, the {{new designs}} were {{developed}} first by miniature painters, {{as they started}} to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This {{marks the first time}} when the [...] "classical" [...] design of Islamic rugs was established: The <b>medaillon</b> and corner design (pers.: [...] "Lechek Torūnj") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail I employed the miniature painter Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century. As some carpets like the Ardabil carpets have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them: ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Moore became employed in France in war work, while Guggisberg rejoined the army. [...] Moore founded the Women's Emergency Corps, which organised women volunteers, and established several leave clubs, acting as {{director general of the}} British Navy, Army and Air Force Leave Club in Paris. After the armistice, in Cologne, she organised a club for the army of occupation. In 1918 she was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for her services and was awarded the overseas medal and the <b>Médaillon</b> de reconnaissance. While her husband was a colonial governor, she served her country as Honorary Exhibition Commissioner for the Gold Coast at the British Empire Exhibition (1923–26), was Chairman of The Play Actors (1927–29), and Chairman of the Overseas Section of the Forum Club (1928–32). [...] During World War II in Paris, she reestablished the British Leave Club in 1939. She fled the city on 11 June 1940, only a few hours before the entry of the Germans, attaching a notice to the doors of the club: [...] "Temporarily Closed".|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-twentieth century, {{commercial}} production {{started in the}} villages of Abadeh and Yalameh. Abadeh rugs adopted traditional Qashqai designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. Yalameh carpets more resemble Khamseh designs with hooked <b>medaillons</b> arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.|$|R
50|$|In Munich {{he first}} {{became known as}} a {{portrait}} artist who created <b>medaillons,</b> reliefs and busts of famous stage artists, singers, artists, scholars, councillors, church dignitaries, diplomats, and royalty, after photographs. His work impressed by their great lifelikeness and careful execution. Soon he also executed tomb sculptures, religious and mythological sculptures, animals and group works.|$|R
50|$|The {{three-dimensional}} jug on {{the oriental}} rug {{is a piece}} of Westerwald Pottery. The kelim thrown over a bannister, probably produced in Uşak, covers a third of the painting and showes <b>medaillons</b> and leaves. The instrument is probably a cittern. The dark coat with five buttons was added by Vermeer in a later stage.|$|R

25|$|Isfahan, Nain, and Qom revived or started carpet {{manufacture}} by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets {{are produced}} with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by Safavid designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated <b>medaillons,</b> and tender light blue and ivory colours. Isfahan carpets use more dark {{red and blue}} colours.|$|R
2500|$|The square sacristy, a {{structure}} extended {{at the northern}} façade of the church, contains a cross-ribbed vaulted ceiling from the 15th century. Within the nave there is a baroque wooden pulpit of 1690 with a decorative pulpit ceiling. The retable, created in 1656, and restored in 1958, is structured by columns and tuberous ornaments (...) on the edges (Wangen), surrounding portrait <b>medaillons,</b> which display Moses and John the Baptist.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} fifteenth century, {{the design of}} the carpets {{depicted}} in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format <b>medaillons</b> appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier “kufic” border design was replaced by tendrils and arabesques. The resulting change in carpet design was what Kurt Erdmann termed the “carpet design revolution”.|$|R

50|$|His first sculptural {{work were}} the tombs, at {{both sides of}} the main altar, of the first two Portuguese kings, Afonso I and his successor, Sancho I. The kings lie on their tombs, clad in full armour, with hands joined in prayer and a lion or dog (symbol of fidelity) at their feet. Their serene {{expression}} is such that one would think that they are asleep. The tombs are set in large niches richly decorated with statues, flowers and <b>medaillons</b> in Late Gothic and Early Renaissance style, with on top the crosses of the Order of Christ.|$|R
50|$|On {{the wall}} are frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted in 1482. The apotheosis of St. Zenobius, first {{patron saint of}} Florence, was painted with a perspectival {{illusion}} of the background. In this background {{one can see the}} Cathedral, with Giotto's original facade and bell tower. In the lunette above is a bas-relief of the Madonna and Child. This fresco is flanked on both sides by frescoes of famed Romans: on the left Brutus, Gaius Mucius Scaevola and Camillus, and on the right Decius, Scipio and Cicero. <b>Medaillons</b> of Roman emperors fill the spandrils between the sections.|$|R
50|$|The {{hexagonal}} Neo-Gothic pulpit {{stands on}} six marble pillars. The front panels show {{us in the}} middle a preaching Christ, flanked on both sides by the Church Fathers: Saint Augustine, Saint Gregory, Saint Jerome, and Saint Ambrose. These half-reliefs are framed inside sunken <b>medaillons</b> with a gilded mosaic background. Four pillars support the wooden soundboard and on top a spire with a statue of John the Baptist. And just as the sculptor of the Stephansdom has been portrayed under the pulpit of that church, {{the architect of the}} Votivkirche, Heinrich Ferstel, has been portrayed under this pulpit by Viktor Tilgner.|$|R
