2500|$|On 11 September 1938, {{just before}} the Munich crisis, Churchill wrote an oft-repeated comment {{in a letter to}} Moyne: [...] "Owing to the neglect of our defences and the {{mishandling}} of the German problem in the last five years, we seem to be very near the bleak choice between War and Shame. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we shall choose Shame, and then have War thrown in a little later, on even more adverse terms than at present." ...|$|E

60|$|Another {{less obvious}} cause of <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the love of}} our kind cannot exist, or at all events not unmixed with {{contempt}} and various other unpleasant ingredients, in people who live and have their being amidst thousands and millions of their fellow-creatures herded together. The great thoroughfares in which we walk are peopled with an endless procession, an innumerable multitude; we hardly see and do not look at or notice them, knowing beforehand {{that we do not}} know and never will know them to our dying day; from long use we have almost ceased to regard them as fellow-beings.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder you}} can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln's Inn {{now with a}} shudder of disgust. There are only two {{things in the world}} that make life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you sitting in an office over a ledger, and do you wear a tall hat and an {{umbrella}} and a little black bag? <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one should look upon life as an adventure, one should burn with the hard, gem-like flame, and one should take risks, one should expose oneself to danger. Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always thought you had talent.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2001, McNichol {{announced}} that she had retired from acting. Her publicist released this statement:"A {{lot of people have}} wondered what I've been up to.

I must say <b>that</b> it has <b>been</b> {{the best thing that ever}} happened to me.

We {{sat down on the}} ground, and chatted good-humouredly with the soldiers. They were fine fellows, without the least sign of brutality--in fact, full of sympathy. They had every right to be angry with us, for we had spoiled their sleep after they had gone through a trying day; yet they did not visit it on us in any way, and were most kind. They even shared their drinking-water with us. I cannot describe what <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> night. A prisoner!' ...|$|R

5000|$|It frightens me when I {{learn of}} 10,000 people {{treating}} a Star Trek script {{as if it}} were Scripture. I certainly didn't write Scripture, and <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those who did were not treated very well in the end ... I'm just afraid that if it goes too far and it appears that I have created a philosophy to answer all human ills that someone will stand up and cry, 'Fraud!' And with good reason.|$|E

5000|$|Computer Gaming World gave Air Bucks a {{negative}} review. The magazine criticized the interface, version 1.0's slow game speed, and poor computer AI and economic model, and concluded [...] "Right now, <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this flight has been delayed". In 1993 Impressions released version 1.2, advertising {{that it was}} a [...] "New Air Bucks!" [...] with [...] "the features you want", including better VGA graphics, interface, computer AI, and economic model.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Ryan Freel took over center field for the Reds, and Griffey Jr. was moved to right field. Reds manager Jerry Narron said that [...] "I've got to do everything I can do to put our best club out there. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with Ryan Freel out there, it gives us strong defense up the middle." [...] Griffey changed his number from 30 to 3 to honor his three children. During the next two seasons, Griffey would wear number 42 on April 15, beginning a tradition known as Jackie Robinson Day.|$|E
5000|$|Gary Green's {{opinion of}} the split differs. In 2003 he commented: [...] "My own {{personal}} opinion is that the band broke up because Derek really wanted a hit album, and I think Ray did too, and they were fed up. They had been musicians longer than I had, and they had tasted it pretty good when they were with Simon Dupree, at least in Britain. And {{they were looking for}} some of that in Giant too. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we could have continued on as PFM did, or Yes, and still continue. If we had adhered to the statement we started out with, we could still be playing that, and still be earning a reasonable living. That's all water under the bridge and that's fine now. It seemed a bit silly to cut off your creativity for that kind of thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, [...] "I do not think I am pessimistic but I think I am {{realistic}} about {{how much you can}} change deeply entrenched prejudice, so <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> if someone <b>were</b> a committed racist, possibly Harry Potter is not going to have an effect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one ever}} {{will know what}} <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> at <b>that</b> moment. I shook {{from head to foot}} as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague.

5000|$|On August 20, the United States National Security Council {{confirmed}} that the video was authentic. An unnamed forensics expert, however, commissioned by The Times (UK) to analyze the video, said, [...] "I {{think it has been}} staged. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped". The Times concluded, [...] "No one is questioning that the photojournalist was beheaded, but camera trickery and slick post-production techniques appear to have been used." [...] Jeff Smith, Associate Director of the CU Denver National Center for Media Forensics said, [...] "What's most interesting is that the actual beheading that takes place in the videos, both of them are staged." [...] Particularly, it was noted that no blood {{can be seen in the}} video, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times.|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{paintings}} are done mostly from memory. After making simple indications of mass and movement, I start painting {{from the top}} down in thin color washes, working into it with paint a little thicker. While painting landscape, <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the detail and the mass are built on varieties of paint application, but when a painting is finished, these details have somehow become recognizable things. It is always a surprise to me how specific my {{paintings are}}. What I remember as color and paint put in a particular area of the painting because they were needed, has somehow become identifiable landscape elements. Figure and still life, however, are more aggressive as subject matter. Here my impulse is to pull the background as far forward as possible, to push the subject back into it; to reduce the specific—to insist on the paint and the painting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Küntzel said he {{had given}} similar {{addresses}} (at Yale University, as well as universities in Jerusalem and Vienna) {{around the world and}} there had been no problems. [...] "I know this is sometimes a controversial topic," [...] he said, [...] "but I am accustomed to that and I have the ability to calm people down. It's not a problem for me at all. My impression was that they wanted to avoid the issue {{in order to keep the}} situation calm. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this is a kind of censorship."Dr. Küntzel also said that the contents of emails described to him did not overtly threaten violence but [...] "they were very, very strongly worded". He added: [...] "It's stupid, because I also talk about Christian anti-semitism." [...] Members of the German department at Leeds accused the university of [...] "selling-out" [...] academic freedom.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Berman's initial story did {{not involve}} Lore. The {{character}} was added at Michael Piller's suggestion, who believed the story needed an additional jeopardy element. Piller recalled: We were standing around going through Rick's story and <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> after reading his first draft {{that the idea of}} Data going back to see Dr. Soong and the story of the child who was hurt in the practical joke were not enough elements to hold up the episode. Once Data goes back to see Dr. Soong, it's basically a chat and without some jeopardy or another event to go on I was afraid {{it was going to be}} flat. We talked about what we could do and, ultimately, the obvious thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we bring Lore back[...].I knew from the moment we came up with it that Brent Spiner in three roles was going to make for an unforgettable episode and I think it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{was merely}} going to hazard an observation, that {{according}} to <b>my</b> <b>feelings,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> to <b>my</b> own peculiar view of the case, I should prefer some people thinking more about their own business, and, and, but I mean nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lady Chatterley's Lover {{was banned}} in 1928 but republished in 1960 by Penguin Books. The {{decision}} {{was taken to}} prosecute Penguin under the new Obscene Publications Act. Bernard Levin criticised the decision thus: [...] "It is surely {{going to be difficult}} for the prosecution to find anybody taken seriously by the literary or academic worlds to swear that publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover is not in the public interest as a literary event and that its tendency would be to deprave and corrupt those who might read it." [...] When Manningham-Buller saw this in The Spectator, he cabled Sir Jocelyn Simon, Solicitor-General saying: “suggest seriously consider spectator 19th Reggie”. He then sent a letter stating: “It seems to me a clear contempt of court and the only question is should we start proceedings? <b>My</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we should." [...] Manningham-Buller suggested prosecuting [...] "the proprietors of The Spectator, the editor and Mr Bernard Levin" [...] once the Chatterley trial itself was over. Sir Jocelyn convinced him to reconsider.|$|R
5000|$|An unnamed {{forensics}} expert {{commissioned by}} The Times {{to look at}} the James Foley video said, [...] "I think it has been staged. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the murder may have happened after the camera was stopped." [...] The Times concluded that [...] "No one is questioning that the photojournalist James Foley was beheaded, but camera trickery and slick post-production techniques appear to have been used." [...] Two unnamed video specialists in the International Business Times of Australia claimed that portions of the video appeared to be staged and edited. Dr James Alvarez, a British-American hostage negotiator, also claimed the James Foley video was [...] "expertly staged", with the use of two separate cameras and a clip-on microphone attached to Foley's orange jumpsuit. Jeff Smith, Associate Director of the CU Denver National Center for Media Forensics, said [...] "What's most interesting is that the actual beheading that takes place in the videos, both of them are staged." ...|$|E

40|$|According to Finley, {{markets and}} {{economic}} motivations played little, if any, role in ancient economies. Status and civic ideology governed {{the allocation of}} scarce resources. Hence, the application of economic theory to the ancient economy was at best a futile exercise and at worst a source of grave misunderstandings. Temin’s seminal and continued contributions to the field lead to the opposite conclusion and, as in the myth of Sisyphus, the boulder seems again {{to be at the}} bottom of the hill! <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Gordian knot remains the same now as over the past decades: should cliometrics be used in the social sciences/humanities in general, and ancient history especially?...|$|E

2500|$|Bernstein was {{appointed}} in 1973 to the Charles Eliot Norton Chair as Professor of Poetry at his alma mater, Harvard University, and delivered {{a series of}} six televised lectures on music with musical examples played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. However, these lectures were not televised until 1976. Taking the title from a Charles Ives work, he called the series The Unanswered Question; it was a set of interdisciplinary lectures in which he borrowed terminology from contemporary linguistics to analyze and compare musical construction to language. The lectures are presently available in both book and DVD form. The DVD video was not taken directly from the lectures at Harvard, rather they were recreated again at the WGBH studios for filming. This {{appears to be the}} only surviving Norton lectures series available to the general public in video format. Noam Chomsky wrote in 2007 on the Znet forums about the linguistic aspects of the lecture: [...] "I spent some time with Bernstein during the preparation and performance of the lectures. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> onto something, but I couldn't really judge how significant it was." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bill Bundy was {{somewhat}} {{to the left}} of his brother politically, and was a spirited opponent of Joseph McCarthy. He was also considered one of the administration's more dovish members on Vietnam, and was an advisor to three presidents. In 1989 he acknowledged the complexity of the presidents' decisionmaking, saying, [...] "In a nutshell, <b>my</b> present <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> a tragedy waiting to happen, but one made much worse by countless errors along the way, in many of which I had a part." ...|$|R
