25|$|Swarming is a {{well-known}} behaviour in <b>many</b> <b>animal</b> species from marching locusts to schooling fish to flocking birds. Emergent structures are a common strategy found in <b>many</b> <b>animal</b> groups: colonies of ants, mounds built by termites, swarms of bees, shoals/schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds/packs of mammals.|$|R

5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Cast shadows {{give away}} even well-camouflaged animals. <b>Many</b> <b>animals</b> {{therefore}} {{take care to}} minimise shadow, by lying down, with flattened bodies, or with fringes. Some hawkmoth caterpillars have false shadow patterns to suggest they are parts of other objects.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>animals</b> {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>animals,</b> {{including}} moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, {{make use}} of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. <b>Many</b> <b>animals</b> depend on such a clock to maintain their circadian rhythm. Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E

5|$|The film grossed {{less than}} its budget of $175 million worldwide, and {{received}} generally negative reviews. Evan Almighty was also notable for {{allegations that the}} <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures stressed the animals' conditions were acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Unsuitable {{backyard}} {{fruit tree}} netting also kills <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. Barbed wire may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in <b>many</b> <b>animals.</b> This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E

5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by <b>many</b> <b>animals.</b> For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Phlox, {{played by}} John Billingsley, is {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise. A Denobulan member of the Inter-Species Medical Exchange, Phlox is brought aboard the Enterprise {{to care for the}} Klingon {{passenger}} during the ship's first mission. Afterwards, he volunteers to stay on, delighting in the experience of humanity taking its first steps onto the galactic stage. An exceedingly cheerful alien, Dr. Phlox uses <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> and naturalistic cures in practicing medicine, in addition to the usual technological methods.|$|E

5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. <b>Many</b> <b>animals</b> bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E
5|$|In <b>many</b> <b>animals</b> of {{the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
