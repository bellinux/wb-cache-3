40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to obtain a validated equation of state for hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and use this equation to calculate thermodynamic properties. The approach was based on using both reliable critical property values and a value of the acentric factor in the Soave Redlich Kwong and the Peng Robinson model equations of state. These equations were validated by comparing calculated molar volumes for phase equilibrium with published experimental values and comparing calculated vapor pressures with published experimental values over the temperature range appropriate for the corresponding state equations. The equation of state giving the best results was used to calculate enthalpy and entropy departure functions and fugacity values. Additional thermodynamic property calculations were performed to produce partial <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagrams</b> and thermodynamic properties containing internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy values for hydrazine and MMH. The analyses of systems in which either adiabatic or near-adiabatic compression of liquid or vapor hydrazine or low velocity detonations occur require a validated equation of state for representing occurring molar volumes and for energy calculations. Other calculations for thermodynamic properties of hydrazine are available, but the values are for a strict ideal gas state.

5000|$|Determining the {{thermodynamic}} {{state of}} the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the ratio of specific heats (also called [...] "isentropic exponent", adiabatic index, [...] "gamma" [...] or [...] "kappa") {{is assumed to be}} constant along with the gas constant. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the isentropic chain. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagram</b> would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagram</b> is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagram)</b> or a chemistry based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the Gibbs free energy method. Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton-Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed [...] "NASA Glenn Research Center"). Other names for CEA are the [...] "Gordon and McBride Code" [...] and the [...] "Lewis Code". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modelled). CEA can be downloaded from the Internet along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.|$|E

However, further justification and quantification of costs for maintaining optimal indoor conditions for maximized employee productivity are necessary. This paper presents graphic-analytical approach {{to investigate the}} effects of indoor climate on energy consumption and productivity with respect to costs for maintaining optimal indoor air conditions in office buildings. Thermodynamic analysis of air conditioning processes is performed using statistical data for outdoor temperature and relative humidity.

In water heating systems, the heat sink is water and the heat source can be ambient or exhaust air, {{the ground in a}} closed water loop, groundwater in an open loop or any other medium in which heat can be recovered. In normal operating conditions, the produced thermal energy is at least two times higher than the mechanical work consumed. That is why heat pumping technology can be interesting compared to conventional boilers or electric heaters. This chapter deals with vapour-compression air-source heat pumps applied to water systems for space heating and domestic hot water production. First, the classic subcritical heat pump cycle is detailed in terms of processes by means of <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Basic notions will be given concerning the efficiency of the cycle (coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency) depending on different parameters such as temperature, high and low pressure, subcooling and superheating. This cycle is then compared to the transcritical cycle used with CO 2 for hot water production. The list of advantages (such as temperature glide at high pressure) and drawbacks (such as lower efficiency for low temperature water heating) of this cycle will tend to limit the use of the CO 2 transcritical cycle to DHW production. Secondly, some of the major improvements brought to the vapour compression cycle will be reported through works made by the research community on multi-stage and inverter compressors, expansion devices, such as ejectors and work recovery devices and the design or the specific use of heat exchangers. Multi-stage compressors enable one to achieve higher pressure ratios and to reduce the heat losses during the compression. Ejectors recover some kinetic energy of expansion and increase the suction pressure at the compressor. Work recovery devices produce some mechanical work that can be reused at compression to reduce the energy consumption. Other improvements are made using internal heat exchangers, desuperheaters for domestic hot water production, microchannels instead of regular tubes for refrigerant and a special fin design to enhance the convection heat transfer coefficient. Heat pumps can also satisfy simultaneous needs in heating and cooling to carry out energy savings. Finally, dealing with air-source heat pumps compels to examine two points: the frosting problems and the defrosting strategies. Frosting reduces the global performance by diminishing the air flow cross section area and by adding a thermal resistance between air and refrigerant. It appears when the ambient air temperature is low and grows faster when the air humidity is high. These conditions occur during winter, when the needs in space heating are high. So an efficient defrosting strategy becomes necessary to ensure the user a satisfactory winter seasonal performance. Conventional defrosting strategies such as hot-gas bypass, reversed-cycle, electric heating and other strategies more in a research phase using air recirculation or a two-phase thermosiphon are discussed in the final part of this chapter...|$|R

In nine separate chapters the reader is briefly introduced to the principle of steam turbine as well as to some common type of steam turbines, basic diagrams of steam cycles and their illustrations in T-s <b>diagram</b> and <b>Mollier</b> h-s <b>diagram.</b> The attention is then individually focused on the process of energy change, how is the steam energy transformed into a mechanical energy, the inference of turbine output power, the assesment of actual efficiency of steam diagram systems and on the facilities that allow for an increase of the efficiency in practice. In the second section of the project, the calculation of thermal diagram of free-cylinder turbine with steam reheating is introduced as a follow-through to the theoretical basics. The rated output of the turbo-set is 100 MW. The thermal cycle is defined by the main steam parameters, the reheat parameters and the emission pressure. Setting component is basic thermal diagram which foremost introduces the connections of system of regenerative heaters from the point of utilisation of the heating steams condensates. First chapter of the second section targets the general method of solution, which in connectedness consists of the concept of steam expansion in the turbine, the concept of heating feed water in regenerative heaters, the assignment of the mass steam flows in the cycle and the assignment of energy index figures. The method analysis is, even in the scope of determining basic parameters detailed. In the second chapter, the general method is subsequently applied to a numeral calculation of the given diagram.

To investigate any improvement when using these fluids, {{the effects of}} the properties of nine different working fluids on the overall combined cycle efficiency have been considered. In this respect, the economic, environmental, and operating performances of an ORC depend on the properties of the working fluids as well as the design and operating characteristics of the cycle. A suitable fluid for an ORC must exhibit favorable physical, chemical, environmental, safety, and economic properties such as low specific volume, liquid specific heat, viscosity, toxicity, flammability, ozone depletion potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP), and cost, as well as favorable process characteristics such as high efficiency, latent heat, density, molecular weight, <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagram</b> close to isentropic, suitable thermal stability limits, compatible with turbine materials and lubricating oil, non-corrosive, non-inflammable, and moderate pressure in the heat exchangers[11, 12, 13]. The saturated vapor specific volume gives an indication of condenser size, which is related to the system's initial cost. A super-atmospheric (> 100 kPa) saturation pressure eliminates infiltration of gases, which is important for operational reasons, since gas infiltration reduces system efficiency. The working fluid having high latent heat and high density is preferred. To achieve the maximum output power of the combined cycle, Rankine cycle efficiency must be increased. For this reason, {{the effects of the}} properties of several working fluids on the Rankine cycle efficiency have been studied.|$|E
40|$|O fenômeno da nucleação é um processo intrinsecamente irreversível. A Teoria Entrópica da Nucleação (TEN) aborda-o analisando um processo reversível equivalente no qual há liberação de calor latente (variação da entalpia), concomitante a um rearranjo estrutural descrito pela variação da entropia antes e depois de certa quantidade de {{material}} ter nucleado. Para visualizar a dinâmica e facilitar a análise foi escolhido um processo isobárico. O diagrama de Mollier modificado para evidenciar a região metaestável ajudou a desenvolver uma expressão para o cálculo do tamanho do núcleo crítico, mediante a teoria da flutuação de Landau. Para analisar o sistema na região metaestável, obteve-se a função entropia, S(H,P 0), em que aspectos físicos e geométricos (como o princípio de estabilidade termodinâmica) foram determinantes. Cálculos do núcleo crítico em relação à temperatura mostraram concordância qualitativa com o trabalho de Dillmann-Meier. Porém, entende-se que a função do núcleo crítico está incompleta. Para lidar com aglomerados e núcleos em uma abordagem termodinâmica, um ensemble a pressão constante é o mais apropriado, cuja variável conjugada é o volume. Com base em uma teoria das flutuações isotérmicas em um fluido ideal (Koper-Reiss), desenvolveu-se a teoria das flutuações não-isotérmicas (Mokross), aplicável a um fluido não-ideal metaestável mantido a pressão e temperatura constantes. Os parâmetros termodinâmicos do elemento de volume que flutua mudam e diferem daqueles do banho, e evolvem acordando com a equação de estado S=S(H,P). The {{phenomenon of}} nucleation is an intrinsically irreversible process. The nucleation is explored by the Entropic Nucleation Theory (ENT), in which, the irreversible process {{is replaced by}} an equivalent one, although now, the process is reversible {{in which there is}} a change in the enthalpy, and also an structural rearrangement coded in the change of de entropy. To study the dynamics and perform the analysis an isobaric process was chosen. The metastable region was used to develop an expression for the calculation of size of the critical nucleus, having in mind the Landau´s fluctuation theory. This region was obtained with the help of the modified <b>Mollier</b> <b>diagram.</b> The physical and geometric features of the system were crucial to obtain the entropy function, S(H,P 0), used to analyze the metastable region. Calculations of the critical nucleus, with respect to the temperature, were in qualitative agreement with Dillmann-Meier work. Although, the function for the critical nucleus is incomplete. To handle with clusters and nucleus in a thermodynamic framework, a constant pressure assemble is preferable having the volume as the conjugated variable. With the help of the isothermal fluctuation theory, in an ideal fluid (Koper-Reiss), the non-isothermal fluctuation theory (Mokross) was developed, and used to study a non-ideal metastable fluid kept at constant pressure and temperature. The thermodynamics parameters of the fluctuating volume element change, differing from those of the bath, and the state equation, S=S(H,P) gives its evolution...|$|E
40|$|The overall thermal {{efficiency}} of power producing and power consuming processes increases if they operate at lower condensing temperatures. The {{purpose of this}} work {{is to show that}} reduced condensing temperatures can be achieved by augmentation of external heat transfer. Substantial improvement is obtained when the outside heat transfer surfaces are continuously wetted by recirculated water of which only a smal quantity evaporates and needs to be replenished. Such heat exchangers known as evaporatively cooled condensers use air and water simultaneously. ^ Problems associated with the evaporative condenser theory exist because the heat and mass transfer processes within the system are not of the closed type. Differential equations which describe the process cannot be solved, since the number of unknown parameters is larger than the number of available equations. The lack of acceptable theory is compensated by the collection of experimental data and by fitting them in some empirical form. ^ This work is directed in an entirely different way than similar reported work in literature. The study provides analytical solutions to the problem by recognizing that the heat transfer performance and the change of state of air and water along their paths in the heat exchanger can be evaluated in a step-by-step procedure. This was first performed {{with the aid of a}} <b>Mollier</b> i-x <b>diagram</b> and later simulated by an extensive computer program. A platefin tube type condenser and bare tube type condenser models were investigated. The heat and mass transfer processes in an evaporative condenser were solved by computerized graphical methods using the i-x diagram which obeys all conservation laws. ^ Analytical results were compared with measured experimental data from a bench type apparatus. An in-line bare tube test section has been tested and its performance was compared with the predicted performance. Results are very close. Deviation of measured from predicted data are of the order of only a few percent. ^ Results of this investigation show undoubtedly the benefit of the evaporative cooling method for augmentation of heat transfer in a condenser. Reduced condensing temperatures are commonly close to ambient temperature or even below it. Savings of energy consumption range from 10 percent for power plants to 50 percent for refrigeration systems. Wetting the condenser with water requires only a very small amount of additional power. ...|$|R
