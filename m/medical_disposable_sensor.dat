40|$|Miniaturization is an {{increasing}} trend {{in the field of}} analytical chemistry {{as a response to the}} need to develop new analytical techniques for food, clinical, and environmental applications.

This review describes <b>disposable</b> <b>sensors</b> for detection of lead, cadmium and mercury in the environment, taking into account their analytical performance.

30|$|In this paper, {{we address}} these {{challenges}} {{by developing a}} novel tracking system that operates on commodity mobile devices, specifically on Android-based tablet platforms. Mobile devices are attractive for use as prototypes and experimental environments for <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> node platforms due to their low cost, widespread availability, and integration of advanced communications, sensing, and processing features. The concept of <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes for defense- and security-related intrusion detection is important because such devices can simply be discarded (“forgotten about”) when {{they are no longer}} operational. Thus, human lives {{do not have to be}} put at risk for their retrieval. However, application of disposable devices in mission-critical tracking applications is challenging due to their limited resources for processing and their limited battery capacity.|$|R
40|$|A <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for the measurement of copper(II) concentration in aqueous solution based on {{a change in the}} fluorescence of porphyrazine 2, 7, 12, 17 -tetra-tert-butyl- 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraaza- 21 H, 23 H-porphine (TP). The sensor was constructed by spin-coating a polyester support with a PVC solution containing TP, a plasticizer, the chelating agent Zincon and the ion-pairing benzetonium chloride. The measurement principle is based on the radiationless resonance energy transfer (RET) from TP immobilized in membrane, and acting as fluorescence donor, to Zincon acting as an acceptor induced by copper(II). The absorption spectrum of the Zincon–Cu(II) complex presents adequate overlapping with the emission spectrum of TP, producing a useful analytical signal by the RET process. The <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> responds to copper(II) irreversibly over a dynamic range from 0. 039 to 14 �mol L − 1 (2. 5 – 890 �gL − 1) with a sensor-tosensor reproducibility (relative standard deviation RSD) of 1. 9 %, as log a Cu 2 +, at the medium level of the range and a response time of 10 min.

50|$|Currently, {{continuous}} {{blood glucose}} monitoring is not automatically covered by health insurance in the United States {{in the same}} way that most other diabetic supplies are covered (e.g. standard glucose testing supplies, insulin, and even insulin pumps). However, an increasing number of insurance companies do cover continuous glucose monitoring supplies (both the receiver and <b>disposable</b> <b>sensors)</b> on a case-by-case basis if the patient and doctor show a specific need. The lack of insurance coverage is exacerbated by the fact that <b>disposable</b> <b>sensors</b> must be frequently replaced. Some sensors have been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for 7- and 3-day use, though some patients wear sensors for longer than the recommended period) and the receiving meters likewise have finite lifetimes (less than 2 years and as little as 6 months). This is one factor in the slow uptake in the use of sensors that have been marketed in the United States.|$|R

40|$|In this study, reduced {{graphene}} oxide (rGO) was electrochemically {{deposited on}} the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) to prepare a <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> for fast detection of Pb 2 + in foods. The SEM images showed that the rGO was homogeneously deposited onto the electrode surface with a wrinkled nanostructure, which provided 2 D bridges for electron transport and a larger active area for Pb 2 + adsorption. Results showed that rGO modification enhanced the activity of the electrode surface, and significantly improved the electrochemical properties of SPCE. The rGO modified SPCE (rGO-SPCE) was applied to detect Pb 2 + in standard aqueous solution, showing a sharp stripping peak and a relatively constant peak potential in square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). The linear range for Pb 2 + detection was 5 ~ 200 ppb (R 2 = 0. 9923) with a low detection limit of 1 ppb (S/N = 3). The interference of Cd 2 + and Cu 2 + at low concentrations was effectively avoided. Finally, the rGO-SPCE was used for determination of lead in real tap water, juice, preserved eggs and tea samples. Compared with results from graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS), the results based on rGO-SPCE were both accurate and reliable, suggesting that the <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> has great potential in application for fast, sensitive and low-cost detection of Pb 2 + in foods...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{we report}} on the {{development}} of a palladium-based, microfabricated point-of-care electrochemical sensor for the determi-nation of manganese using square wave cathodic stripping voltammetry. Heavy metals require careful monitoring, yet current methods are too complex for a point-of-care system. Voltammetry offers an attractive approach to metal detection on the microscale, but traditional carbon, gold, or platinum electrodes are difficult or expensive to microfabricate, preventing widespread use. Our sensor uses palladium working and auxiliary electrodes and integrates them with a copper-based reference electrode for simple fabrication and compatibility with microfabrication and printed circuit board processing, while maintaining competitive performance in electrochemical detection. Copper electrodes were prepared on glass substrate using a combination of microfabrication procedures followed by electrodeposition of palladium. The <b>disposable</b> <b>sensor</b> system was formed by bonding a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) well to the glass substrate.
