50|$|On April 11, 2017 Regan {{ruled in}} favour of Nater and invited him to once again <b>move</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> refer the issue to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, the {{procedure}} by which finite debating times for particular bills are set, or protracted debates {{are brought to}} a close, {{is referred to as}} a [...] "guillotine". Generally, a minister will declare that a bill must be considered as urgent, and <b>move</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> limit debating time. The declaration and motion may refer to a single bill, or to multiple bills or packages of bills. A guillotine motion may not be debated or amended, and must be put to a vote immediately.|$|E
50|$|An {{election}} to the House of Commons is formally begun by {{the issue of a}} writ by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. In the case of a by-election, the Speaker must first issue a warrant to the Clerk of the Crown to allow the Clerk to issue a writ. The most common reason for the Speaker to issue a warrant is that he has been required to do so by a resolution of the House of Commons itself. This requires an MP to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> command the Speaker to issue his warrant. Such motions are moved at the start of proceedings in the House of Commons.|$|E
500|$|In 1931 Bruxner <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> censure Sydney University Professor of Philosophy John Anderson for his {{statements}} that war memorials were [...] "political idols". The motion was vigorously debated {{but did not}} pass.|$|R

50|$|Following Diane Payton's {{arraignment}} and plea of {{not guilty}} her attorney, Kay Hartley, approaches Southerlyn and identifies {{herself as an}} old college friend, although Southerlyn affects to barely remember her. But in a following discussion with McCoy, Southerlyn reveals she remembers Hartley as a highly competitive student set upon becoming a high-earning Wall Street lawyer. Hartley says her firm has asked her to take on Mrs. Payton's case pro bono. McCoy is surprised a tax lawyer would be asked to try a criminal case, suspicions which deepen after Hartley fails in a legally naive attempt to have Payton's confession excluded from evidence. Southerlyn is approached by Hartley while exercising in Central Park. Hartley reveals Danny Payton was her cousin and Diane Payton is her aunt. Hartley has taken a leave of absence from her firm to defend her aunt. Danny Payton had schizophrenia and Hartley wants to introduce his medical records into evidence, but Diane Payton refuses to allow this. Hartley wants to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> remove Diane Payton's legal responsibility for her deceased son's records so they can be used as evidence, and pleads emotionally for Southerlyn's help. Partially through sympathy with Hartley and Payton, the DAs agree not to oppose the motion, which is granted.|$|E
50|$|In June 2011 he {{successfully}} <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> ban {{wild animals}} in circuses. In the House of Commons {{he stated that}} he had been placed under pressure by the prime minister <b>to</b> withdraw the <b>motion,</b> first by being offered a job, and then by being threatened.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2014 Councillor Phil Halse <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> {{remove the}} HAC from the Long Term plan citing {{procedural}} issues. This was narrowly passed leading to one national newspaper running the headline 'Whangarei kills reason to visit'. Following the decision the council building council staff reported ...|$|R
50|$|Barka {{was elected}} to the Adamawa Assembly for the Hong constituency.In July 2003, as Majority Leader of the Assembly, he {{successfully}} <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> dissolve the State Civil Service Commission, State Independent Electoral Commission and the Judicial Service Commission, replacing them by management committees with members nominated by the governor.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2013, the {{parliament}} <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> remove the cabinet secretary for Land, Housing and Urban Development, Charity Ngilu {{on grounds that}} she breached the Kenyan constitution by making some appointments at the ministry. She was accused of appointing the director-general without involving {{the parliament}} which is a requirement of the law.|$|R
50|$|As {{the date}} of the Annual General Meeting drew nearer, FAZ Division II side Mazabuka United <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> pass <b>a</b> vote of no {{confidence}} in Bwalya's executive which, if supported by two thirds of the FAZ affiliates, meant the end for Bwalya and his executive and the ushering in of an interim executive into office.|$|R
25|$|In November 1953 Linstead was {{inadvertently}} {{the cause}} of some political difficulties to the Conservative government. He <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> annul <b>an</b> Order in Council which lifted an embargo on cut glass imports, arguing that {{to do so would}} damage the domestic industry. After debate he intended <b>to</b> withdraw the <b>motion,</b> but the Labour opposition (which wanted to continue the embargo) objected and put the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> the vote; with the Conservative whips not expecting a division, they lost by four votes. This was the first vote which the government had lost.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} {{advanced}} for not using the alternative count in 1987 was that the method should only be adopted if the Senate passed a resolution before the double dissolution. To this end Labor Senator John Faulkner <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> use section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a future double dissolution. It was noted in the debate that the motion could not bind the Senate in the future. The same motion was moved in 2010 by Liberal Senator Michael Ronaldson and was agreed to without debate.|$|R
5000|$|On March 23, 2017 Nater made an {{intervention}} in the House of Commons on the Question of Privilege raised a day earlier by Lisa Raitt and Maxime Bernier. Nater argued there was sufficient grounds for a Prima Facie question of privilege. On April 6th, 2017 Speaker Geoff Regan ruled there was. However, during debate on the motion following the ruling the Liberal MP Alexandra Mendès <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> proceed to orders of the day, ending the debate {{and with it the}} opportunity to address a violation of Members' rights.|$|R
50|$|Bose {{along with}} A M Nair was {{instrumental}} in persuading the Japanese authorities to stand by the Indian nationalists and ultimately to officially actively support the Indian independence struggle abroad. Bose convened a conference in Tokyo on 28-30 March 1942, which decided to establish the Indian Independence League. At the conference he <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> raise <b>an</b> army for Indian independence. He convened the second conference of the League at Bangkok on 22 June 1942. It was at this conference that a resolution was adopted to invite Subhas Chandra Bose to join the League and take its command as its president.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was a time}} of {{depression}} and at his maiden speech in the House of Commons, he <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> urge the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald to help create employment by a progressive policy of carrying out public works where there was greatest need. He also gained concessions on unemployment insurance for workers in the sugar beet industry, one of the constituency's main seasonal employers. He was described by an unnamed source as [...] "the best commercial traveller the Wrekin division has ever had" [...] for his mainly successful efforts to gain orders for local industries.|$|R
5000|$|The Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe {{prepared}} a report stating that this device violates many articles {{of both the}} European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and should be banned in Europe, because it is often [...] "painful" [...] and causes [...] "degrading and discriminatory consequences for young people". In September 2008, Baroness Sarah Ludford MEP <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> the European Parliament to ban {{the use of the}} Mosquito. It failed to get enough signatures from MEPs to proceed to a full debate.|$|R
50|$|He {{drafted and}} co-signed all the {{documents}} of transmittal and subsequent resolutions to the Governor General and to both Houses of Parliament. These requested {{compensation for the}} tax-exempt status of Government facilities and activities in Ottawa and financial aid to expand City infrastructure to accommodate the newly located Legislature and the Offices of the Government and pay {{for the construction of}} permanent office buildings. On 10 August 1877, Lett <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> constitute <b>a</b> Committee, which included the Mayor of Ottawa, Members of Parliament, Aldermen and businessmen, to draft a constitution and new bylaws for the government of the “new society” of the City of Ottawa.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} July, {{public opinion}} started to turn against the scheme and at least four public {{petitions}} were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme. On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, Communist leader K. P Gopalan <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly J. Shivashanmugam Pillai used his casting vote <b>to</b> defeat the <b>motion.</b> <b>A</b> second <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by K.R Viswanatham. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes. The Scheme was stayed and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 November 2015, Attorney-General John Elferink <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> suspend {{standing}} orders to debate removing Purick from the Speaker's role, citing what he claimed were partial comments she had posted on Facebook regarding government-funded advertising about anti-ice legislation. On {{the morning of}} 18 November, the CLP and independent Larisa Lee passed Elferink's <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> spill the speakership role. The CLP nominated Matt Conlan to replace Purick. However, when the ballot to elect a new speaker was held, Labor and Delia Lawrie re-nominated Purick to stand against Conlan, and an unknown CLP member [...] "crossed the floor" [...] to vote for Purick, allowing her to regain her old post by 13 votes to 12.|$|R
25|$|All 33 Labour councillors on Camden Borough Council {{voted on}} 7 March against setting a rate; they {{included}} Stephen Bevington {{who had only}} been elected a week before {{on a platform of}} setting no rate. The Conservative group on the council, who had supported setting the rate {{at the level of the}} cap, immediately called for surcharges on councillors where the delay in setting the rate led to financial losses for the council. At a Labour group meeting on 26 March, Alan Woods <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> declare that Camden would continue to refuse to set a rate even if other boroughs gave up; with council leader Phil Turner abstaining, the motion was lost by 15 votes to 14.|$|R
50|$|During the Sino-British {{negotiations}} {{over the future}} of Hong Kong and the drafting of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December 1984, Lee joined the delegation of Office of the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELCO) to meet with the British politicians in London and raised concerns about the Joint Declaration. The UMELCO also attempted to mobilise public opinion on the terms of the Sino-British agreement and made known Hong Kong's views to both the British and Chinese governments. Legislative Council member Roger Lobo <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> demand <b>a</b> debate in the Legislative Council on the draft of Sino-British Joint Declaration in February 1984. It was backed by Allen Lee.|$|R

25|$|In the King's Birthday Honours list of June 1949, Plummer was {{appointed}} as a Knight Bachelor. However, {{by the summer}} of 1949 {{it was clear that the}} groundnut scheme was in trouble, having gone over budget. The Conservative Party in the House of Commons <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> reduce the estimate in respect of the scheme on 27 July 1949. In November, one member of the Overseas Food Corporation board, A.J. Wakefield, became so critical of the management of the scheme that the Minister determined to dismiss him. Wakefield offered to resign only if Plummer did so as well; this was unacceptable to Strachey and Wakefield was dismissed. Plummer and Wakefield had a lengthy exchange of public statements, in which Wakefield accused Plummer of suppressing his suggestions.|$|R
50|$|On 14 December 2010 Greens {{councillor}} Cathy Peters <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> {{support the}} international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel. This motion {{was supported by}} Greens, Labor and one independent councillor, including the Mayor at the time, Fiona Byrne. The motion was widely condemned by politicians {{from both sides of}} politics including Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, then Premier Kristina Keneally and federal Greens leader, Bob Brown. The move received support from Nobel Peace Prize Laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mairead Maguire. On 14 April 2011 it was revealed that the boycott would cost Marrickville ratepayers 3.4 million if implemented. The boycott also meant the council would have to replace goods from companies such as Hewlett Packard, Holden, Volvo and Motorola amongst others.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{convicted and}} imprisoned for {{homosexual}} offences prior to August 1986 are not automatically eligible {{to hide the}} offences under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004, since the Act applies retrospectively to current and abolished offences equally. However, individuals with an otherwise clean criminal record can apply to a District Court {{to have the conviction}} disregarded. However, this process only conceals these convictions - it does not erase them altogether. On 28 June 2017, the Government introduced the Criminal Records (Expungement of Convictions for Historical Homosexual Offences) Bill which would allow men convicted for homosexual offences to apply to wipe out their convictions from the records. On 6 July, the bill had its first reading. Justice Minister Amy Adams <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> apologise for convictions the same day, to which Parliament agreed unanimously.|$|R
50|$|After {{boundary}} changes, Hewitson {{was returned}} for Kingston-upon-Hull West. Representing many fishermen, he <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> in Parliament <b>to</b> stop a proposed doubling in the levy for the White Fish Authority in September 1956.|$|R

2500|$|Over a {{year after}} he assumed the {{leadership}}, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member Ken McCaw moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robson's leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Robson then <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> prevent Pat Morton, who {{was the only person}} nominated for leader, from taking the leadership. This was defeated 16 votes to 6 and Morton was elected unnopposed as leader, with Robert Askin remaining as Deputy Leader. Robson retorted {{that there had been a}} [...] "continuous intrigue" [...] against his leadership. He was returned for the last time at the 3 March 1956 election with 71.41%. Robson, however, did not stay long afterward; on 26 July 1957, he resigned his seat and returned to his legal practice until he retired.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{appointment}} to cabinet, White {{continued to have}} frequent differences of opinion with Edwards. Matters {{came to a head}} on 4 August 1983, when Liberal MLA Ian Prentice <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> bring forward debate on the establishment of a public accounts committee to monitor government spending. While this had been approved by a resolution at a Liberal party convention, it was bitterly opposed by Bjelke-Petersen and Edwards was not keen to have it debated, for fear of destabilising the coalition. A division was called, and White {{and the rest of the}} [...] "ginger group" [...] crossed the floor to vote with the Australian Labor Party opposition in favour of the motion. White argued that the principle of cabinet solidarity, which would normally compel him to vote against the motion, did not apply in this case because there was no official government policy on the matter.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{passage of}} Bill C-19, the Province of Quebec <b>moved</b> for <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> prevent the {{destruction}} of the Quebec portion of the records. A temporary injunction was granted on April 5, 2012 in order to leave enough time for proper legal arguments to be heard. On March 27, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled against Quebec, allowing {{the destruction of}} the long-gun registry records.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} of 1867 had generated strong passions. McGee had received death threats and been assigned police protection. The Fenians, although not constituting {{the majority of}} Devlin's supporters, had nonetheless {{played a significant role}} during the election and fallen not far short of achieving their goal of defeating McGee. Denied that outcome, the Fenian members of the St. Patrick's Society instead <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> expel McGee from the Society, and stopped its subscription to the pro-McGee Canadian Freeman. Among the militant Devlin supporters during the 1867 election campaign was an Ottawa tailor by the name of Patrick James Whelan, who had previously declared that McGee was a traitor, that he should be shot, and that if no one else would do the job, he would do it himself. On April 7, 1868, McGee was shot dead on Sparks Street in Ottawa, a crime for which Whelan was later convicted, and hung.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 March 2016; he <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> [...] "mandate {{the use of}} {{life-jackets}} {{and other}} safety gadgets in Maritime Travels on Nigeria's Waterways and Rivers. It called {{on the federal government}} to evolve and publish a national policy on the use of life-jackets and other safety gadgets in maritime transportation in the country. It mandated the committee on maritime transportation to conduct an investigative hearing on the frequency of maritime accidents in the country’s water ways, and make recommendations on how to stem the tide with a view to improving on safety, and urged the Navy, the National Emergency Management Agency and its state counterparts to continue to provide, and indeed improve on their response and rescue activities on our waterways during emergencies. It also mandated the committee on justice to examine all extant laws guarding the maritime sector with a view to updating legislations in order to improve on the maritime security and safety.|$|R
50|$|In April 2007, he {{determined}} that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> in committee <b>to</b> remove the expense, but it failed to pass.|$|R
