25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights {{and all that}} stuff. You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, {{and all these things}} you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E
60|$|But <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> your art. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{what you}} intend {{the reader to}} detect and think {{he has made a}} Columbus-discovery. Then it is well done, {{perfectly}} done. I wrote my last travel book--[Following the Equator.]--in hell; but I let on, the best I could, that it was an excursion through heaven. Some day I will read it, and if its lying cheerfulness fools me, then I shall believe it fooled the reader. How I did loathe that journey around the world!--except the sea-part and India.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just it. I suspect General Lodge cared {{enough for}} you to want you to come back to your job for your sake--for his sake--for sake of the railroad. And not for me." ...|$|R
50|$|After Emperor's death, Tōchi's husband acceded to {{the throne}} and became the next Emperor (Emperor Kōbun), {{although}} there's no record of his enthronement ceremony. She followed him as the Empress. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the most successful time in her life.|$|R
5000|$|For many {{listeners}} ... Imagination bore many distressing signs. ... Or <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{just more}} of Joe's sonic airbrushing. ... complained thatthe real Brian Wilson would never homogenize his music to sound exactly {{like every other}} song on the radio. —Peter Ames Carlin ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All day. It's such a pity, too; it's a {{beautiful}} day, {{and he is}} so unused to being shut up. But he is busy planning his party, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> company for him. I do hope he isn't too lonesome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A war is breeding, Macumazana, {{the last}} great war in which either the White Kendah or the Black Kendah must perish. Or perhaps both will die together. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the real reason why we have asked you to be our guest, Macumazana," [...] and with their usual courteous bows, both of them rose and {{departed}} before I could reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since that {{uprising}} in Russia, and the {{attempt on the}} king in Italy, every nation over here looks with suspicion on all foreigners. But {{there is something else}} to it, I imagine," [...] went on Dave, seriously. [...] "Those fellows acted as if they didn't think much of this expedition which my father has joined. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> under suspicion, too." ...|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a C-, stating [...] "That was too damn long {{to tell a}} story with so little substance and so few real laughs. Kinda like Cloverfield. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the point".|$|R
5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with OK! Magazine, actress Charlize Theron claimed <b>that</b> when she <b>was</b> 18 she was propositioned at an audition by a pajama-clad Hollywood director. [...] "I {{thought it was}} a little odd <b>that</b> the audition <b>was</b> on a Saturday night at his house in Los Angeles, but I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> normal." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lottie wasted neither sympathy nor {{surprise}} on the question. [...] "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> the best thing. Why don't {{you come to}} breakfast?" ...|$|R

I will not marry him if his moral {{character}} is bad; {{but if he}} can prove that it isn't, I will--and he shall have the chance. To me he seems utterly good and dear; I've never seen anything about him that looked otherwise-- except, of course, his calling himself an earl's son. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only vanity, and no real harm, {{when you get to}} the bottom of it. I do not believe he is any such person as you have painted him. I want to see him. I want you to find him and send him to me. I will implore him to be honest with me, and tell me the whole truth, and not be afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|No man {{can tell}} {{what is going}} on in the souls of {{soldiers}} while [...] noble women are offering love and tenderness, throwing themselves [...] upon the altar of war, hoping blindly to send their great spirits [...] marching to the front. Perhaps the man who lives through the war [...] will feel the change in his soul if he cannot tell it. Day by day I [...] think I see a change in my comrades. As they grow physically [...] stronger they seem to grow spiritually lesser. But <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] only my idea. I see evidences of fear, anger, sullenness, moodiness, [...] shame. I see a growing indifference to fatigue, toil, pain. As these [...] boys harden physically they harden mentally. Always, 'way off there [...] is the war, and that seems closely related to the near duty [...] here--what it takes to make a man. These fellows will measure men [...] differently after this experience with sacrifice, obedience, labor, [...] and pain. In that they will become great. But I do not think these [...] things stimulate a man's mind. Changes are going on in me, some of [...] which I am unable to define. For instance, physically I am much [...] bigger and stronger than I was. I weigh one hundred and eighty [...] pounds! As for my mind, something is always tugging at it. I feel [...] that it grows tired. It wants to forget. In spite of my will, all of [...] these keen desires of mine to know everything lag and fail often, [...] and I catch myself drifting. I see and feel and hear without [...] thinking. I am only an animal then. At these times sight of blood, [...] or a fight, or a plunging horse, or a broken leg--and these sights [...] are common--affects me little until I am quickened and think about [...] the meaning of it all. At such moments I have a revulsion of [...] feeling. With memory comes a revolt, and so on, until I am the [...] distressed, inquisitive, and morbid person I am now. I shudder at [...] what war will make me. Actual contact with earth, exploding guns, [...] fighting comrades, striking foes, will make brutes of us all. It is [...] wrong to shed another man's blood. If life was meant for that why do [...] we have progress? I cannot reconcile a God with all this horror. I [...] have misgivings about my mind. If I feel so acutely here in safety [...] and comfort, what shall I feel over there in peril and agony? I fear [...] I shall laugh at death. Oh, Lenore, consider that! To laugh in the [...] ghastly face of death! If I yield utterly to a fiendish joy of [...] bloody combat, then my mind will fail, and that in itself would be [...] evidence of God.|$|E
5000|$|... "Extreme Prejudice" [...] - Terminating a rogue agent {{ought to}} be simple. Especially when he is too busy {{ensuring}} the future of humanity to protect himself. But <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the best armor of all.|$|E
5000|$|Harvey later said, [...] "People didn't {{mention the}} blues thing until The Bad Seeds. But {{there was a}} lot of it in the later Birthday Party, The Bad Seed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> due to me, co-writing the songs with Nick. But then, I don't really listen to the blues. It wasn't until later, in the mid-eighties, <b>that</b> Nick <b>was</b> {{listening}} to a bit of John Lee Hooker." ...|$|R
6000|$|But to-night {{they seemed}} to have drawn nearer in spirit to each other, and <b>that,</b> <b>maybe,</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{prompted}} Valerie to sigh, and in her sweet, unthinking innocence to say again: ...|$|R
5000|$|COURIC: I'm {{not sure}} whether {{she was afraid to}} offend certain people, by, she would offend conservatives by saying she read the New York Times.LETTERMAN: Or people who don't read. She was afraid of {{offending}} people who don't read. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it.COURIC: Even in the post-election interviews, Dave, that she's done, nobody has really asked her, [...] "Why didn't you answer that question?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On All About Jazz Budd Kopman noted [...] "Listening to {{this would}} be deliciously {{unbearable}} in a live setting since {{you might not know}} whether to open your arms to the infinite or bang your head, but <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also the point".|$|E
5000|$|... "It was {{explicit}} {{that she}} would support me in a Ward 3 race, including against Mary Cheh," [...] said Frumin, who has consistently {{said he has no}} interest in running against Cheh next year. [...] "The idea of an attempted deal, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what happens in politics, but when you are claiming a whole new politics, that is something of an issue." ...|$|E
5000|$|Die Knowing {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Writing for All About the Rock, Mark Booth said: [...] "This is an album that is full of songs that all seem like they would be perfect live and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what Comeback Kid were looking at getting on record, some of the live intensity and boy have they accomplished that!".|$|E
6000|$|Very well, you say, but the {{explanation}} is not complete yet. How did people come to drift into such a strange custom? What was {{the origin of the}} idea? [...] "Well, nobody knows; it was probably a revelation sent down by the gods." [...] One more thing: Why was such a cruel death chosen--why wouldn't a gentle one have answered? [...] "Nobody knows; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a revelation, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor old Fan, she don't {{get much}} petting; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>'s</b> what she wants. I 'll try it and see, for she stands by {{me like a}} trump. If she was a rosy, cosy little woman, like Polly, it would come easier, though," [...] thought Tom, as he meditatively ate his last nut, feeling that fraternal affection could not be very {{difficult}} of demonstration, to brothers blessed with pretty, good-tempered sisters.|$|R
5000|$|Was {{chosen to}} have a [...] "Celebration of Diversity in Computing" [...] conference [...] named after him (usually held biannually [...] ). Actually, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> should <b>be</b> 1.5 conferences, {{counting}} of the Blackwell-Tapia prize#Blackwell-Tapia Conference.|$|R
5000|$|Erin Markey’s energy, her sensibility, is so {{singularly}} {{constructed for}} herself that it couldn’t {{be transferred to}} another person, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> one thing people mean in calling her a performance artist. She plays [...] "Erin Markey" [...] as an outsized persona through autobiographical sketches interlaced with musical numbers—a tried and true nightclub strategy. The songs, usually contemporary pop songs, are performed with an intensity that unravels them.|$|E
50|$|Ida, however, never {{joined him}} on his trips to America. Nils Oscar really tried to {{convince}} her and the children to come along, but {{this was one of}} the few things he never succeeded in doing. Ida was a woman with a will of steel, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why he loved her so. She managed to bring up the sons and run the farm by herself during the time Nils Oscar spent in America.|$|E
5000|$|Graber {{was raised}} in Wildwood, New Jersey where she still owns a home. She studied under poet Stephen Dunn {{and went on to}} earn her BA in {{philosophy}} from New York University. She quit teaching middle school English to afford herself the ability to enroll in an MFA program and pursue a career in poetry. Kathleen said of the experience, [...] "Most poets live humble lives, I think, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> by temperament or design, or maybe it is just a necessity." ...|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, {{the fact}} that the Major has been reading all of Pinin's letters does {{indicate}} an unusual level of interest in the boy's personal life. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just protocol, and the Major happened to notice Pinin's lack of a love life? Or perhaps it wasn't, and the Major pointedly read all of the orderly's letters to assess his sexuality? The Major may have had a hunch based on happenings Hemingway didn't include in the story.|$|R
60|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{on account}} of Lohier's remark upon <b>that</b> head; or <b>maybe</b> it <b>was</b> hoped <b>that</b> the reading would kill the {{prisoner}} with fatigue--for, as it turned out, this reading occupied several days. It <b>was</b> also decided <b>that</b> Joan should <b>be</b> required to answer squarely to every article, and that if she refused she should be considered convicted. You see, Cauchon was managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time; he was drawing the toils closer and closer.|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Teddy Park. According to the CEO of YG Entertainment, Yang Hyun Suk, [...] "2NE1’s new song counter feeds {{the people with}} an analogue sound unlike the majority who used strong electronics and house music and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why Will I. Am have sic found it interesting". They also released teasers of [...] "Lonely" [...] starting with CL and Minzy on May 9, and Dara and Bom on May 10. The music video was released on May 11, 2011.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{obituary}} for John Buller in the Guardian, Martin Wainwright wrote, '...John's {{discovery of}} Joyce fuelled him {{for most of}} his creative life, and I think what became fundamental to everything he composed was the Joycean notion that imagination is nothing but extended memory, that the commonplace of our musical or aural consciousness is virtually infinite, so that the task of the composer is {{to go down to the}} elements of musical consciousness and reorder them. His voice, in everything, came from this vision, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why it embraced a wider than usual range of idioms and contrasts, including popular elements.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Brownstein {{began playing}} guitar at 15 and {{received}} lessons from Jeremy Enigk. She later said: [...] "He {{lived in the}} neighborhood next to mine, so I would just walk my guitar over to his house. He showed {{me a couple of}} open chords and I just took it from there. I'd gone through so many phases as a kid with my interests that my parents put their foot down with guitar. So instrument ended up being the first thing that I had to save up my own money for [...] and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the whole reason that I actually stuck with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sessions}} featured {{plenty of}} give-and-take between the young, scrappy band and the older, more-polished producer. Said Adams later: [...] "He Scott {{wanted to make}} something flow. He wanted to make our record work, whereas we wanted our record to get damaged." [...] And for his part, Scott points to a particularly raw-sounding guitar part in the song [...] "Everything I Do" [...] and says, [...] "I listen to that and go, oh my God, we should've redone that guitar because it just is a little rough on such a beautiful song. But <b>that's</b> <b>maybe</b> what they liked about it; they <b>were</b> like, 'No, <b>that's</b> cool'... <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the bruise on the apple <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> looking for." ...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the many}} {{questions}} related to this site, one concerns why Little Meg was not aligned with the midwinter or midsummer line to Long Meg. Clare suggests <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> line <b>was</b> considered too 'sacred', or that the existing vegetation precluded seeing the line, or <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> already another monument there.|$|R
