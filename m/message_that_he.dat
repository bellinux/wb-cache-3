5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage. Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led {{to the end of}} their marriage, and that he never spoke to her again after sending a text <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was divorcing her while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism. She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide. After the marriage ended in 2012, Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.|$|E
5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

25|$|The Khalkha nobles' {{power was}} {{deliberately}} undermined by Qianlong, when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal {{family of the}} eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba, instead of the Khalkha Mongol which {{they wanted to be}} appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles, and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor. Nevertheless, Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols.|$|E

When 4th Division arrived (25 August) Snow’s orders were to help prepare a {{defensive}} position on the Cambrai-Le Cateau position, as GHQ {{had no idea of}} the seriousness of the situation facing II Corps. 4th Division was eventually able to participate in the Battle of Le Cateau. The news that Smith-Dorrien planned to stand and fight at Le Cateau reached GHQ at 5am on 26 August – French was woken from his sleep, and insisting that Murray not be woken, sent Smith-Dorrien an ambiguous <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had “a free hand as to the method” by which he fell back, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to fight.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|French’s {{division}} {{moved in}} line of squadron columns across a five-mile wide front, halting between 12.30 and 1pm at the well at Blauuwboschpan, {{where he left}} a garrison to hold until the infantry arrived. He brushed aside a small Boer force (perhaps 300 men) which attempted to block his path to the Modder River, but concerned {{that he might be}} attacked from the east by de Wet’s main force, moved quickly at 2pm to seize the crossings at Rondeval and Klip Drift (he aimed to at least threaten two crossings to avoid the delay which had happened at De Kiel's Drift). By 5pm he was able to send a galloper to Roberts with the <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was across the Modder. He had lost only three men wounded, although 40 horses had died of exhaustion and over 500 were incapable of further work. French then had to wait a day while Kelly-Kenny’s 6th Infantry Division made a forced march from the Riet Crossings to the Modder Crossings, during which time Cronje, believing French’s advance to be a feint, missed an opportunity to reinforce the area.|$|E

500|$|Pepys found Bloodworth {{trying to}} {{co-ordinate}} the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, [...] "like a fainting woman", crying out plaintively {{in response to}} the King's <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was pulling down houses. [...] "But the fire overtakes us faster then we can do it." [...] Holding on to his civic dignity, he refused James's offer of soldiers and then went home to bed. King Charles II sailed down from Whitehall in the Royal barge to inspect the scene. He found that houses were still not being pulled down, in spite of Bloodworth's assurances to Pepys, and daringly overrode the authority of Bloodworth to order wholesale demolitions west of the fire zone. The delay rendered these measures largely futile, as the fire was already out of control.|$|E
500|$|In another {{unfavourable}} review from Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh dismissed {{much of the}} album's first side as [...] "padded subterfuge" [...] while opining that [...] "there just isn't compensation {{here for}} the failed promise of 'This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)'". NME writers Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that, {{in comparison with the}} Beatles track, Harrison's [...] "often-impressively lachrymose guitar falls short of true grief-stricken form here", adding: [...] "The lack of a tune doesn't help." [...] Conversely, Record Worlds single reviewer wrote that Harrison [...] "hits the mark with this edited extra textural ballad" [...] and highlighted Wright's ARP strings among the [...] "superb accompaniment" [...] on the recording. In his review for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman admired it as a [...] "scorching track" [...] with a lyrical <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deemed [...] "Hot, pertinent, touching".|$|E
500|$|On the 15thAugust, 1917, the Smack [...] "Nelson" [...] {{was engaged}} in fishing when she was {{attacked}} with gunfire from an enemy submarine. The gear was let go and the submarine's fire was returned. The submarine's fourth shot went through the port bow just below the water line and the seventh shell struck the skipper, partially disembowelling him, and passed through the deck and out through {{the side of the}} ship. In spite of the terrible nature of his wound Skipper Crisp retained consciousness, and his first thought was to send off a <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being attacked and giving his position. He continued to command his ship until the ammunition was almost exhausted and the smack was sinking. He refused to be moved into the small boat {{when the rest of the}} crew were obliged to abandon the vessel as she sank, his last request being that he might be thrown overboard.|$|E

500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, [...] "May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, {{is very much in}} love. When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers him quite superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty." [...] According to a reviewer, Jack comes up to the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.|$|E
