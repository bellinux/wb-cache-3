6000|$|... 'Well, I write papa's sermons for {{him very}} often, and he preaches them {{better than he}} does his own; and then {{afterwards}} he talks to people and to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{he said in his}} sermon to-day, and forgets that I wrote it for him. Isn't it absurd?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} to ask <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I saw in Pall Mall and {{opposite}} the Hyde Park Hotel?" [...] he said, speaking slowly and in a voice scarcely raised above a whisper. [...] "I told them all before the operation, but they couldn't send for you then. There wasn't time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When folks jaw <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> {{nothing to}} them I always give them {{as good as}} they bring. That's my principle," [...] said Harry, flinging out of the house, while the curate tried to console the weeping mother, and soon after betook himself to his Rector with no mild {{comments}} on the lad's insolence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm really fond of her, Jim, and didn't mean to {{hurt her}} feelings. But tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> yourself; <b>what</b> made you come West?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Philip broke in, [...] "I {{know all}} this. I know {{everything}} you have told me, and everything you can tell <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> <b>about</b> it? <b>What</b> have you got to say to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{was gone}} only ten days, {{and came back}} late on a Friday evening. He tried to tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he had done and seen, but broke off and said, [...] "Well, I am very stupid; I went to all the places {{they told me to}} see at Rouen and {{everywhere}} else, but I can't recollect anything about them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and she'll {{take his}} soul {{to pay for}} it. She'll make him a witch, like herself. I say it's wicked to have {{anything}} to do with those sort of people. Last night, sir, I lay awake and read in my little Bible that my poor old mother gave <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is going to happen to sorceresses and them sort, till my hair stood on end. Lord, how the old lady would stare if she saw where her Job had got to!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ada stood silent a moment. 'I don't know, sir,' {{she began}} quietly, 'by what right {{you speak to}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you call my cock-and-bull stories. If the master is mad, all I can say to anybody is I'm very sorry to hear it. I came to my mistress, sir, if you please; and I prefer to take my orders from one who {{has a right to}} give them. Did I {{understand}} you to say, ma'am, that you wouldn't want me any more this evening?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you seem}} to preach to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>What</b> can I do for the girl? The fact is, he don't care for her a bit, and never did." ...|$|R
2500|$|Meyer speaks humorously, {{sharing with}} her {{audience}} her own shortcomings and taking playful jabs at stereotypical church behavior. A particular crowd favorite is the [...] "robot" [...] routine, {{in which she}} goes into a stiff-armed imitation of a robot chanting [...] "What <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> <b>What</b> <b>about</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" [...] cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. [...] "You {{must not}} tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> things. <b>What</b> is done is done. What is past is past." ...|$|R
60|$|As for my money, I gave {{it all to}} my mistress-nurse, as I called her, {{and told}} her she should have all I got for myself when I was a gentlewoman, as well as now. By this and some other of my talk, my old tutoress began to {{understand}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I meant by being a gentlewoman, and that I understood by it no more than {{to be able to}} get my bread by my own work; and at last she asked me whether it was not so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Arty's {{nearly as}} fat as I am, but she can be pretty spry if there's {{something}} she can do for you. Nice crowd there, too except that Teddem--he's one of these here Willy-boy actors, always out of work; I guess Mrs. Arty is kind of sorry for him. Say, Wrenn--you seem {{to me like a}} good fellow--why don't you get acquainted with the bunch? Maybe you'd like to move up there some time. You was telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> a cranky old party your landlady is. Anyway, come on up there to dinner. On me. Got anything on for next Monday evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And meanwhile, my dear little man, {{till you}} {{know a great deal}} more about nature than Professor Owen and Professor Huxley put together, don't tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> cannot be, or fancy that {{anything}} is too wonderful to be true. [...] "We are fearfully and wonderfully made," [...] said old David; and so we are; and so is everything around us, down to the very deal table. Yes; much more fearfully and wonderfully made, already, is the table, as it stands now, nothing but a piece of dead deal wood, than if, as foxes say, and geese believe, spirits could make it dance, or talk to you by rapping on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faraday told <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you {{had done}} to this paper," [...] he said. [...] "I came {{to see if you}} would let me in on it. I want work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. What is it but {{plotting}} when three folk--you {{and she and}} this Raffles Haw--whisper and arrange and have meetings without a word to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it? <b>What</b> do I know of your plans?" ...|$|R
60|$|Speaking <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> {{did he say}}? What did he say? What did he say <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> Don't ask.|$|R
6000|$|I {{descended to}} the cabin, and {{prepared}} Monkton {{for what was}} coming. He was still questioning <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I had observed on deck when the storm burst on us. We felt the little brig strain for an instant as if she would part in two, then {{she seemed to be}} swinging round with us, then to be quite still for a moment, trembling in every timber. Last came a shock which hurled us from our seats, a deafening crash, and a flood of water pouring into the cabin. We clambered, half drowned, to the deck. The brig had, in the nautical phrase, [...] "broached to," [...] and she now lay on her beam-ends.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then if, on {{the other}} hand, you are restless and anxious about the future, study {{astronomy}} at once. Your troubles will be reduced amazingly. But your study will reduce them in a singular way, by reducing the importance of everything. So that the science is still terrible, even as a panacea. It is quite impossible to think at all adequately of the sky--of what the sky substantially is, without feeling it as a juxtaposed nightmare. It is better--far better--for men to forget the universe than to bear it clearly in mind! [...] . But you say the universe was not really what you came to see <b>me</b> <b>about.</b> <b>What</b> was it, may I ask, Lady Constantine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mitchell," [...] Jimmy went on, {{unconscious}} of {{the emotions}} which his every word was arousing in his hearer's bosom, [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened yesterday. He is very depressed. He {{said he could not}} think how he happened to behave in such an abominable way. He entreated me to put in a word for him with you. He begged me to tell you how he regretted the brutal assault, and asked me {{to mention the fact that}} his record had hitherto been blameless." [...] Jimmy paused. He was getting no encouragement, and seemed to be making no impression whatever. Mrs. Pett was sitting bolt upright in her chair in a stiffly defensive sort of way. She had the appearance of being absolutely untouched by his eloquence. [...] "In fact," [...] he concluded lamely, [...] "he is very sorry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ex.: [...] ("Why are {{you telling}} them such things <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> <b>what's</b> all this?") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} of any. Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> yourself: <b>what</b> {{have you}} been doing all this year?" [...] he asked, {{watching}} with genuine satisfaction the serene and sunny face before him, for discontent, anxiety, and sadness were no longer visible there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Man {{with a flat}} face," [...] said Dirk anxiously, as he slit away at the {{stitches}} of {{the saddle}} to find the letter; [...] "tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him. <b>What</b> was he like, and {{what makes you think}} he wished to take the paper from you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is better. He {{went off}} {{this morning in}} {{what looked like a}} natural sleep, and when he woke, an hour ago, I could see that he knew me. I don't suppose he knew he had been lying insensible for a week, but thought I had just come back from work. He whispered, 'How does it look to-day, Jim?' and after what you told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you thought about the old course of the river, I was able to say honestly, 'I think the chances look more favourable.' He whispered, 'We shall make a fortune yet, Jim,' and then drank some soup and went off to sleep again. Tomorrow morning I will set to work again. I don't believe a bit in the dream myself, but it will make him more {{comfortable}} to know that I am at work upon it; and after all it may turn out some good." ...|$|E
6000|$|I felt rather {{guilty in}} my ignorance, and I had {{a notion that}} it did not commend me, but happily at this moment Mr. Emerson was called to dinner, and he asked me to come with him. After dinner we walked about in his [...] "pleached garden" [...] a little, and then we came again into his library, where I meant to linger only till I could fitly get away. He {{questioned}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I had seen of Concord, and whom besides Hawthorne I had met, and when I told him only Thoreau, he asked me if I knew the poems of Mr. William Ellery Channing. I have known them since, and felt their quality, which I have gladly owned a genuine and original poetry; but I answered then truly that I knew them only from Poe's criticisms: cruel and spiteful things which I should be ashamed of enjoying as I once did.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do know it. I {{am quite}} sure of it. And {{therefore}} I don't {{think you ought}} to be afraid to talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> must concern my happiness so greatly. As far as my own self and my own will are concerned I consider myself given away to Mr. Lopez already. Nothing but his marrying some other woman,--or his death,--would make me think of myself otherwise than as belonging to him. I am not a bit ashamed of owning my love--to you; nor to him, if the opportunity were allowed me. I don't think there should be concealment about anything so important between people who are dear to each other. I have told you that I will do whatever you bid me about him. If you say that I shall not speak to him or see him, I will not speak to him or see him--willingly. You certainly need not be afraid that I should marry him without your leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Milt! Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> you. <b>What</b> are you doing? What are you studying? How do you live? Do {{you really}} cook your own meals? Do {{you begin to}} get your teeth into the engineering? Oh, do tell me everything. I want to know, so much!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you were}} present at Charles' third victory? How that young fellow handles his troops, and what {{wonderful}} troops they are! Now {{we will get}} into our easy chairs again, and you shall tell <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you have been doing, since we last met." ...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Hansen. In Phil Hansens {{breakout}} art piece Influential, Stephen Hawking was referenced in 5 of {{the layers}} of influence, with one clearly being of Hawking himself. [...] "He affected my outlook on life. He made <b>me</b> think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> life is and what I should do with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{put myself}} forward or criticize any {{one for the}} world, and Vida {{is one of my}} best friends, and such a splendid teacher, and there is no one in town more {{advanced}} and interested in all movements, but I must say that no matter who the president or the committees are, Vida Sherwin seems to be behind them all the time, and though she is always telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she is pleased to call my 'fine work in the library,' I notice that I'm not often called on for papers, though Mrs. Lyman Cass once volunteered and told me that she thought my paper on 'The Cathedrals of England' was the most interesting paper we had, the year we took up English and French travel and architecture. But----And of course Mrs. Mott and Mrs. Warren are very important in the club, as you might expect of the wives of the superintendent of schools and the Congregational pastor, and indeed they are both very cultured, but----No, you may regard me as entirely unimportant. I'm sure what I say doesn't matter a bit!" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND SIMONEAU,--It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to tell how glad I was to get your letter with your good news and kind remembrances, it did my heart good to the bottom. I shall never forget the good time we had together, the many long talks, the games of chess, the flute on an occasion, and the excellent food. Now I am in clover, only my health a mere ruined temple; the ivy grows along its shattered front, otherwise, I have no wish that is not fulfilled: a beautiful large garden, a fine view of plain, sea and mountain; a wife that suits me down to the ground, and a barrel of good Beaujolais. To this I must add that my books grow steadily more popular, and if I could only avoid illness I should be well to do for money, as it is, I keep pretty near the wind. Have I other means? I doubt it. I saw François here; and it was in some respects sad to see him, pining in the ungenial life and not, I think, very well pleased with his relatives. The young men, it is true, adored him, but his niece tried to pump <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> money I had, with an effrontery I was glad to disappoint. How he spoke of you I need not tell you. He is your true friend, dear Simoneau, and your ears should have tingled when we met, for we talked of little but yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} why I haven't already started with you?" [...] Chad, {{beginning}} {{his coffee and}} buttering his roll, was quite ready to explain. [...] "Nothing would have induced me--nothing will still induce me--not {{to try to keep}} you here {{as long as you can}} be made to stay. It's too visibly good for you." [...] Strether had himself plenty to say about this, but it was amusing also to measure the march of Chad's tone. He had never been more a man of the world, and it was always in his company present to our friend that one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world acquitted himself. Chad kept it up beautifully. [...] "My idea--voyons!--is simply that you should let Madame de Vionnet know you, simply that you should consent to know HER. I don't in the least mind telling you that, clever and charming as she is, she's ever so much in my confidence. All I ask of you is to let her talk to you. You've asked <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you call my hitch, and so far as it goes she'll explain it to you. She's herself my hitch, hang it--if you must really have it all out. But in a sense," [...] he hastened in the most wonderful manner to add, [...] "that you'll quite make out for yourself. She's too good a friend, confound her. Too good, I mean, for me to leave without--without--" [...] It was his first hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{on to the}} parade-ground, Mulvaney, it's cooler there, {{and tell}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Miss McKenna. <b>What</b> is she, and who is she, and why is she called 'Jhansi'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Pagett," [...] said Orde, [...] "has {{been asking}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Congress. <b>What</b> is your opinion?" [...] Burke {{turned to the}} M. P. with a frank smile.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{have lived}} a really {{interesting}} life,” she told Pamela J. Johnson in July 2006. “I haven’t lived it so I can excavate material for my writing.” She added, “I’m a novelist. I don’t have those muscles. It’s not <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> It’s <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I’ve imagined. It’s the universal voice that I want to move forward. That’s my natural voice.” ...|$|R
