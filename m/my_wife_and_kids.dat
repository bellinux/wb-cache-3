Did I leave a six-figure corporate job to be a bartender, or did I leave to build a brand and a future for beer culture in Beijing?" [...] He chose the latter, and just before Chinese New Year in 2012 was informed at a dinner with officials {{that they had been}} impressed with the brewery's cleanliness and would be granting the license. The company prepared to increase its output drastically, to 15,000 hectoliters (1,500,000 L).

500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} towards New Guinea {{in early}} 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Jackson {{was promoted to}} acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.75 Squadron on 19March, barely {{two weeks after the}} unit was formed at Townsville, Queensland. He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, who had led No.3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No.75 for operations at Port Moresby, where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers. Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, [...] "What are you fighting for? King and country? Well, I'm fighting for <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>kids</b> and no Jap bastard's going to get them!" [...] On 21March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome {{to take part in the}} defence of Port Moresby, a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign, and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called [...] "one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF". [...] The unit was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks, whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed [...] "Tomorrowhawks", [...] "Neverhawks", and [...] "Mythhawks" [...] by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as [...] "Old John" [...] to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots, many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics, and fired their guns just once.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} months {{after moving to}} Los Angeles, Lautner {{appeared}} in small television roles, small film roles, and ads and commercials. In 2001, Lautner {{first appeared in the}} made-for-television film, Shadow Fury. He then got a voice-over job in a commercial for Rugrats Go Wild. He then appeared in small television roles on The Bernie Mac Show, <b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kids,</b> and Summerland. Lautner then earned voice-over roles in animated series such as Danny Phantom, Duck Dodgers, and What's New, Scooby-Doo?. The same year, he earned his first breakout role, starring in the film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Lautner spent three months on location in Austin, Texas, to film the movie, which was received with negative reviews from critics, and was a minor international success. However, Lautner was nominated at the 2006 Young Artist Awards for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Actor. For the film, Lautner choreographed all of his fight scenes after director Robert Rodríguez learned of his extensive martial arts training. Months later, he played Eliot Murtaugh in Cheaper by the Dozen 2, which was panned by critics, being named one of the [...] "Worst Films of the 2000s" [...] by Rotten Tomatoes. After returning from Canada filming the latter movie, Lautner said he realized his newfound fame, from Sharkboy and Lavagirl. In 2006 he appeared in the show Love Inc. and the TV special He's a Bully, Charlie Brown. Two years later, Lautner appeared in a lead role in the short-lived NBC drama, My Own Worst Enemy, portraying Christian Slater's son, Jack Spivey. Rolling Stone coined his early roles as either [...] "the popular kid, jock, or bully." ...|$|E

China Beat contributor Daniel A. Bell attended the meeting, and shares his experiences as a lone philosopher in a sea of CEOs and political leaders.

After a week-long research trip to Singapore, I barely had time to greet <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>kid</b> before I was jetting off to Dalian, host city of the third annual “Summer Davos” meeting. Yes, it was business class, but they ran out of wine and I had to nurse an uninspiring Yanjing beer. The plane landed at midnight, we were shepherded to a bus and told to wait for other passengers. A couple of Americans complained – in Chinese – that they would rather get off and take a taxi. I joined the chorus of complaints, and finally the bus took us to our hotels. After a few hours sleep, I was waken at 5 : 30 am by the sound of pounding jackhammers outside. I tried {{to make sense of what}} was going on, but there was a power failure in our hotel. After an hour of staring at the ceiling and blocking my ears with five-star fluffy pillows, the lights finally came on. Over breakfast, I met a friendly government official from Tianjin, who was confident that the next Summer Davos would be held in his city, where the forum had been held the previous year. Later, I met an official from Dalian, who was equally confident that his city, which had hosted the first meeting, in 2007, would be selected as the permanent site of the Summer Davos. Clearly there was intense competition between the political leaders of the two cities, though they are supposed to be members of the same party. Off to the conference site. Our electric-battery powered bus drove in a special lane, with policemen and women on every block. It was the first time I had experienced such VIP treatment. The Davos crowd is supposed to be composed of the world’s most politically influential people; I noticed from the program that I was the only participant listed as a “philosopher” and naturally I wondered how I managed to slip under the radar...|$|R
