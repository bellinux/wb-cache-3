50|$|The parasexual cycle, {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and plasmogamy). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and haploidization. <b>Mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while haploidization probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> {{does occur}} in man and {{is much more}} {{frequent}} and important than generally assumed. Its postzygotic occurrence before an embryo differentiates into MZ twins is theoretically predicted to have disrupting effects on genomic imprinting and cis-acting sequences, with consequences ranging from early lethality to MZ twin discordance. Some predictions {{are at odds with}} classical views on twinning and include a high discordance rate of MZ twins for some genetic diseases. A review of MZ twin discordance and an attempt at explaining some of the data lead one to hypothesize both the existence of a sex differences in the rate of <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and the impossibility for crossed X chromosomes to undergo inactivation. The close interrelationship of twinning and midline malformations further suggests a major role of <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> in the induction of the twinning process itself.

We examined <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> induced by two commercial herbicides (diuron and trifluralin) in diploid strains of Aspergillus nidulans based on the homozygotization index. Low doses (2. 5 mu g/mL) of diuron were sufficient to increase the mean homozygotization index in 2. 1 and 11. 3 times for UT 448 //UT 196 and Dp II-I//UT 196, respectively, whereas the same dose of trifluralin increased this mean only 1. 2 (UT 448 //UT 196) and 3. 5 (Dp II-I//UT 196) times, respectively. The lower homozygotization index value found for trifluralin could be due to its interference with <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> in eukaryotic cells. We concluded that the diploid Dp II-I//UT 196 of A. nidulans is more sensitive to organic compounds than UT 448 //UT 196; these compounds cause recombinational events at a greater frequency in the latter diploid.

40|$|Among {{variants}} {{selected in}} a human cell line for nonexpression of a single gene product in the HLA complex, most are single-gene variants, but several have been isolated that are cis-acting and abolish expression {{of a series of}} closely linked genes. The two most plausible mechanisms by which such variants could arise are <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and chromosome deletion. In two HLA variants the presence of a visible chromosome deletion, a 50 % reduction in activity of glyoxalase I (a closely linked marker), or both provided evidence for deletional origins. In a third variant these changes were not demonstrable. All three variants showed reductions in amount of cell surface HLA antigens: 40 % for the Ia antigens (HLA-DR) and 20 - 25 % for HLA-ABC antigens. The reductions in cell surface antigen in deletion variants have an important implication: {{in the case of the}} HLA-A, -B, and -C heterodimer, which consists of a subunit coded for within the major histocompatibility complex and another subunit (β 2 -microglobulin) coded for on a different chromosome, it is the gene of the major histocompatibility complex that is limiting. The nonmutant haplotype includes A 2; binding of an A 2 monoclonal antibody in two of the mutants was found to be approximately equal to that in the wild-type cells. Thus, loss of one copy of HLA-ABC genes does not lead to gene dosage compensation—i. e., increased activity by the remaining ABC alleles.

40|$|After X-ray {{irradiation}} of Crepis capillaris {{dry seeds}} the authors detected, {{in addition to}} usual patterns of chromosome mutations, a new phenomenon of normal rod-shaped chromosomes being „vested,” or encircled, by ring chromosomes. An analysis of the phenomena has demonstrated that the ring-chromosome production is connected with an X-ray-induced formation of a rigid loop by cross-links of different chromosome segments. The repair mechanism seems to cut DNA strands into three fragments at the cross-link site. When the fragment ends brought close together assume a definite position, the middle fragment forms a ring; the rejoined terminal fragments are within this ring which thus vests the chromosome. After DNA synthesis, two sister chromatids are vested by two sister rings.

At this moment the internal chromatids appear to be capable of slipping out in different combinations from the rings vesting them. It has been shown that the DNA strands are cut into fragments during both the production of chromosome rearrangements and <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> Due to the effect of chromosome repair cutting, chromosome rearrangements may result from exchange (contact of exchanging chromosomes in a cross-link site) and fragmentation mechanisms when DNA molecules are cut without cross-links or other mechanism assuring contact between different chromosome loci...|$|E

Phylogenetic trees based on only one allele from each of two or more species will show incorrect divergence times and, more often than not, incorrect topologies. This allele sequence divergence can be stopped temporarily by mitotic gene conversion, <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over,</b> or ploidy reduction. If these convergence events are rare, ancient asexual lineages can be recognized by their high allele sequence divergence. At intermediate frequencies of convergence events, it will be impossible to reconstruct the correct phylogeny of an asexual clade from the sequences of protein coding genes.

Both drugs present therapeutic activity in numerous human neoplasms In the present work the recombinagenic potential of these drugs was evaluated by ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Their effects on the asexual cycle of A. nidulans was also appraised. Two heterozygous diploid strains of A. nidulans, a wild (uvsH+//uvsH+) and a defective to the DNA repair (uvsH//uvsH) were used. The drugs' recombinagenic potential was evaluated by their capacity to induce homozygosis of recessive genes from heterozygous cells. Both drugs have a recombinagenic effect on diploid cells of A. nidulans. Doxorubicin and etoposide are potentially capable to induce secondary malignancies, mediated by the <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> in eukaryotic cells. Doxorubicina e etoposida são agentes intercalantes que inibem a ação da enzima topoisomerase II. Ambas drogas são amplamente utilizadas no tratamento de neoplasias. O potencial recombinagênico destes agentes e seus efeitos sobre o ciclo assexual de Aspergillus nidulans foram avaliados no presente trabalho. Duas linhagens diplóides heterozigotas foram utilizadas: uma selvagem (uvsH+//uvsH+) e outra deficiente para o reparo do DNA (uvsH//uvsH). O potencial recombinagênico destas drogas foi avaliado pela indução de homozigose de genes recessivos a partir de células heterozigotas. Doxorubicina e etoposida apresentaram efeitos recombinagênicos em ambas linhagens utilizadas. Os resultados permitem concluir que doxorubicina e etoposida são agentes potencialmente capazes de induzir malignidades secundárias, mediadas pelo crossing-over mitótico, em células diplóides eucariotas...|$|E
40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a {{unicellular}} fungus {{that can}} be cultured as a stable haploid or a stable diploid. Diploid cultures can be induced to undergo meiosis in a synchronous fashion under well-defined conditions. Consequently, yeasts {{can be used to}} study genetic effects both in mitotic and in meiotic cells. Haploid strains have been used to study the induction of point mutations. In addition to point mutation induction, diploid strains have been used for studying mitotic recombination, which is the expression of the cellular repair activities induced by inflicted damage. Chromosomal malsegregation in mitotic and meiotic cells can also be studied in appropriately marked strains. Yeast has a considerable potential for endogenous activation, provided the tests are performed with appropriate cells. Exogenous activation has been achieved with S 9 rodent liver in test tubes {{as well as in the}} host-mediated assay, where cells are injected into rodents. Yeast cells can be recovered from various organs and tested for induced genetic effects. The most commonly used genetic end point has been mitotic recombination either as <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over</b> or mitotic gene conversion. A number of different strains are used by different authors. This also applies to haploid strains used for monitoring induction of point mutations. Mitotic chromosome malsegregation has been studied mainly with strain D 6 and meiotic malsegregation with strain DIS 13. Data were available on tests with 492 chemicals, of which 249 were positive, as reported in 173 articles or reports. The genetic test/carcinogenicity accuracy was 0. 74, based on the carcinogen listing established in the Gene-Tox Program. The yeast tests supplement the bacterial tests for detecting agents that act via radical formation, antibacterial drugs, and other chemicals interfering with chromosome segregation and recombination processes...|$|E
40|$|The hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-) is {{a normal}} {{component}} of human saliva. It is a highly reactive oxidizing agent, and at concentrations above the values normally found in human saliva, it inhibits the growth and metabolism of oral bacteria. This finding {{has led to the}} suggestion that antibacterial properties of human saliva might be enhanced in vivo by appropriate supplements which elevate OSCN- concentrations. Since DNA is sensitive to oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide attacks nucleosides), high concentrations of OSCN- in human saliva might damage DNA and produce deleterious effects on the oral mucosa. In the present study, the effect of high OSCN- concentrations on several mutagen-sensitive Salmonella typhimurium strains was determined. These strains are used to detect base-pair substitutions and frameshift mutations. We also studied the effects of OSCN- on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) strain commonly employed as a test cell for evaluating the potential of a compound to produce gene conversion, <b>mitotic</b> <b>crossing-over,</b> or reverse mutation. By recording the UV spectra of mixtures of calf thymus DNA and OSCN-, we explored the possible in vitro reactions of this oxidizing agent with eucaryotic genetic material. Our results show that, at concentrations above 10 μM, OSCN- is toxic for the tested Salmonella typhimurium strains. The mutant strains with defects in cell wall lipopolysaccharides are killed more readily by OSCN- than is the strain lacking these defects. However, OSCN- was not mutagenic for any of the tested strains. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not affected by OSCN- even at concentrations above 800 μM. Calf thymus DNA was not oxidized by OSCN-. We conclude that the elevated concentrations of OSCN- required to produce antibacterial effects in the human mouth pose no threat to the genetic material of host tissues...|$|E
