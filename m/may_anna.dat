She {{was the basis}} for the {{character}} Margaret [...] "Meg" [...] of Little Women (1868), her sister's classic, semi-autobiographical novel. The eldest of the four Alcott sisters (being herself, Louisa, Lizzie, and <b>May),</b> <b>Anna</b> is remembered as a dutiful, self-sacrificing and loving sister, wife and mother who conformed to the mold of Victorian womanhood more easily than did her sisters. To her family members, she served as an emotional shelter.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of the July 2005 Development Report published by the Development Bank of Southern Africa, Human Sciences Research Council and United Nations Development Programme (DBSA, HSRC and UNDP). The Report asks why, if the origins of economic dualism {{are rooted in the}} cheap, forced, migrant labour introduced by the mining industry and reinforced during apartheid, does dualism persist under democracy when all the relevant laws and many of the practices of the past have been abolished? The breakdown of apartheid did not immediately translate into improved material conditions for the majority of South Africans: 300 years of colonialism and 50 of internal colonialism had hard-wired a duality into the system. Two worlds, which may be conceptualised as the first and second economies, coexisted: a globally integrated world of production, exchange and consumption, and a constrained world of informality, poverty and marginalisation. This synthesis sheds light on the origin and nature of the ‘second economy’ metaphor, and suggests solutions. This paper is {{a synthesis of}} the 2005 Development Report published by the DBSA in July 2005. It was prepared by Dr Michael Aliber (Human Sciences Research Council), assisted by Rasigan Maharajh (Institute for Economic Research), Marié Kirsten (Development Bank Southern Africa), Josephilda Nhlapo-Hlope (Development Bank Southern Africa) and Oupa Nkoane (Development Bank Southern Africa).

500|$|As {{the centennial}} of Wong's birth approached, a {{re-examination}} {{of her life and}} career took shape; three major works on the actress appeared and comprehensive retrospectives of her films were held at both the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. Anthony Chan's 2003 biography, Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of <b>Anna</b> <b>May</b> Wong (1905–1961), was the first major work on Wong and was written, Chan says, [...] "from a uniquely Asian-American perspective and sensibility". In 2004, Philip Leibfried and Chei Mi Lane's exhaustive examination of Wong's career, <b>Anna</b> <b>May</b> Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work was published, as well as a second full-length biography, <b>Anna</b> <b>May</b> Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend by Graham Russell Hodges. Though <b>Anna</b> <b>May</b> Wong's life, career and legacy reflect many complex issues which remain decades after her death, Anthony Chan points out that her place in Asian-American cinematic history, as its first female star, is permanent.
