5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, {{and we all have}} to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly. As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week.|$|E
25|$|The Bhojpuri film {{industry}} took off again in 2001 with the super hit Saiyyan Hamar ("My Sweetheart", directed by Mohan Prasad), which vaulted {{the hero of}} that film, Ravi Kishan, to superstardom. This success was quickly followed by several other remarkably successful films, including Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi ("Priest, tell <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> will marry", 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad) and Sasura Bada Paisa Wala ("My father-in-law, the rich guy", 2005). In {{a measure of the}} Bhojpuri {{film industry}}'s rise, both of these did much better business in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than mainstream Bollywood hits at the time, and both films, made on extremely tight budgets, earned back more than ten times their production costs. Sasura Bada Paisa Wala also introduced Manoj Tiwari, formerly a well-loved folk singer, to the wider audiences of Bhojpuri cinema. The success of Ravi Kishan & Manoj Tiwari's films has led to a dramatic increase in Bhojpuri cinema's visibility, and the industry now supports an awards show and a trade magazine, Bhojpuri City, which chronicles the production and release of what are now over one hundred films per year.|$|E

Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E

Billboard has pull, but they cannot make people who live hip-hop believe Psy is rap." [...] In response, Billboard chart director Bill Werde defended the changes as a necessary means of reflecting consumer tastes on genre charts.
