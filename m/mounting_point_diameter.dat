50|$|A <b>mount</b> <b>point,</b> in {{streaming}} media systems, {{is a virtual}} resource which references live or on-demand content within a multimedia media server system. <b>Mount</b> <b>points</b> are used to allow multimedia servers {{the ability to control}} multiple content sources and/or types on the same server instance. The <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> name is typically determined in the path location portion of a URI. Channel content and attributes can be stored with <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> definitions and kept separate of global and other <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> settings and limits. This term in {{streaming media}} was popularized by the Icecast server and is used in many software products that support it and others like it.|$|R
50|$|NTFS volume <b>mount</b> <b>points</b> are {{specialized}} NTFS filesystem objects {{which are}} used to mount and provide an entry point to other volumes. <b>Mount</b> <b>points</b> can be created in a directory on an NTFS file system, which gives {{a reference to the}} root directory of the mounted volume. Any empty directory can be converted to a <b>mount</b> <b>point.</b> The <b>mounted</b> volume {{is not limited to the}} NTFS filesystem but can be formatted with any file system supported by Microsoft Windows. Volume <b>Mount</b> <b>Points</b> are supported from NTFS 3.0, which was introduced with Windows 2000.|$|R
50|$|In Europe it {{is common}} for rear racks to have a <b>mounting</b> <b>point</b> for a {{reflector}} or rear light. It is common for the <b>mounting</b> <b>point</b> to have 2 holes which fits M5 bolts, spaced 50 or 80 mm apart.|$|R
40|$|Up to now the {{calculation}} of the speed limit of <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> is carried out {{on the base of}} EN 13236 using a simple analytical method. The results are correct for <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> with shanks of a constant diameter. However results for shouldered shanks reveal considerable derivations compared to finite element analyses (FEA) or measured results. As a consequence the real speed limit is not clear and the <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> cannot be used up to their objective limit of performance. FEA software and test devices for a reliable estimation of the failure speed limit are not available to all manufacturers and users of <b>mounted</b> <b>points.</b> Therefore a new analytical model has been developed. In an associated computer program the results of FEA as well as notch effects and the surface quality are taken into consideration. In order to validate the computed results a test method for <b>mounted</b> <b>points</b> has been developed. First tests have been carried out with good results...|$|R
