5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|The {{group were}} {{surprised}} to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E

5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is {{sometimes}} flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan {{in a final}} frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his <b>microphone.</b> <b>In</b> June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E
25|$|A line of Pressure zone {{microphones}} (PZM) {{was introduced}} by Crown in 1980, culminating in the PZM-30 series in 1990.

The SASS stereo microphone was patented in 1989. Garth Brooks was the first performer to wear the Crown CM311 headset <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> 1993.

25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a directional microphone mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E
25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a plastic case that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates. A waterproof version was used on nearly all U.S. Navy ships. Shure also designed the T-30 Throat Microphone for flight crews. A cloth strap held the T-30 against the throat, capturing the user's voice box vibrations directly and avoiding the background noise of the airplane. Shure also manufactured specialized headsets and the MC-1 oxygen mask <b>microphone.</b> <b>In</b> yet another example of the widespread use of Shure microphones by the U.S. military, U.S. lookout Private Lockhard used a Shure 700A microphone to announce his sighting of Japanese planes approaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of On December 7, 1941.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, when it {{was more}} common for {{electric}} recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, {{making it possible to}} improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon <b>microphone</b> <b>in</b> 1932. Both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture, radio, recording, and public address applications.|$|E
