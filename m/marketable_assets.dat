2500|$|Although Social Security is {{sometimes}} compared to private pensions, {{the two systems}} are different {{in a number of}} respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot [...] "prefund" [...] by investing in <b>marketable</b> <b>assets</b> such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.|$|E

In this article, we put forward the idea that an essential point to analyze FDI concerns their underpinning motives. Motives are at the core of FDI and FDI are only but one of different alternative means for firms to grasp an opportunity in a foreign country. We discuss the factors that shape the set of available alternatives and analyze those affecting the decision to engage in FDI (internalisation determinants), along with those influencing their localisation (localisation determinants). Starting from Dunning (1993) we put forward a revised taxonomy of FDI motives consistent with this framework – resource seeking, market seeking and non- <b>marketable</b> <b>asset</b> seeking. In order to show its practical implications, we survey common empirical issues on FDI showing how our analysis can shed light on seemingly contradictory empirical results...|$|R

If the father hands the son {{the amount in}} cash, the father {{will have to pay}} gift tax on the full amount, as that is the fair market value of the property given. One million dollars is worth exactly one million dollars. Consider this second scenario: The father creates a FLP with himself the General Partner holding a 50% interest and also holds the Limited Partner interest of 50%. He contributes the $1,000,000 in cash, and then gives his son the 50% Limited Partner interest. The fair market value is not 50% of the $1,000,000 although at first it might seem this is the case.

Someone with a partnership interest worth $500,000, but that can't be collected until the GP declares a distribution (which may be many years away) is not as desirable, and a hypothetical and savvy buyer would factor this into their calculation of what they are willing to pay.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 These three papers address {{uncertainty}} in the management and valuation of renewable natural resources. The first paper develops a model to integrate both stock and price uncertainty to obtain optimal resource levels. The model {{is an extension of}} Reed (1974) and shows by proof and by example that when prices can fall below costs, considering stochastic prices is an important element of resource management. The second paper considers the valuation of a United States Forest Service timber harvest contract. The tools and methods of mathematical finance are applied to a timber contract auction to obtain an arbitrage free minimum bid. These methods provide managers with an objective measure to integrate the effects of interest rates, costs, price volatility and contract duration into the contract bid. The third paper fine tunes the exploration of arbitrage-free valuation of natural resource contracts. The paper shows that traditional market-based instruments are not sufficient to hedge contracts on undeveloped resources, such as standing trees {{in the case of the}} Forest Service. Rather, a market-based valuation proxy for the undeveloped resource must be obtained. The contribution of this approach is that it shows the consistency of financial theory for use with nonmarket assets. Also, the results provide a framework within which convenience yield measures for holding the developed, or <b>marketable</b> <b>asset,</b> may be determined. This is important because failure to account for convenience yields results in arbitrage opportunities leaving the contract writer exposed to risk from price fluctuations. These papers offer resource managers the rationale and tools for integrating price {{uncertainty in}}to management plans. They suggest that under uncertainty, harvest levels should be more conservative when prices can fall below harvest costs, and that contract values should be adjusted to accommodate the writer's exposure to lost revenue...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to clarify}} that {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) {{has come a long}} way by the prevailing business case approach, but increasingly hits a glass ceiling. The glass ceiling metaphor refers to the inherent limitations created by a business case approach towards CSR. Design/methodology/approach – The main findings are based on an analysis of existing literature on strategies for CSR. The findings are illustrated with a case from the Dutch National Research Program on CSR. Findings – The very term corporate social responsibility suggests that the debate about CSR is all about responsibilities of corporations. Maybe it once was, but nowadays it is much more about new market opportunities and a business-wise approach to ecological and social problems. CSR has evolved into a <b>marketable</b> <b>asset</b> of companies, in which profit-oriented managers and entrepreneurs are willing to invest. This ‘‘commodification’’ of CSR has helped to make it acceptable in the business world, but this comes at a considerable price from the perspective of the social responsibility of business. It is especially argued in the paper that a business case approach results in opportunism, leaves institutional blockades intact and drives out the intrinsic motivation for engaging in CSR. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen conceptual research approach, the propositions put forward in the paper need further grounding in empirical research. Practical implications – In order to shatter this glass ceiling, managers have to deal with a paradoxical situation. They should maintain their appreciation of economic constraints and at the same time combine this with a sincere recognition of moral values. This at least requires that managers should show commitment to certain social values, be able to defend it in good and bad times and prepare all employees to deal with the inherent dilemmas of bearing different responsibilities. Originality/value – Although the paper builds on earlier articles on limitations of a business case approach, it is the first paper to argue for a glass ceiling of CSR created by the inherent limitations of such an approach...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that, in the {{foreseeable}} future, climate change will exacerbate water problems worldwide. In the United States, {{we are likely to}} see more severe flooding, more frequent droughts, and a rush to secure legal rights to water supplies. Sustainable management of water resources for present and future generations will become all the more imperative as we face increasing pressure on limited supplies. The quest for sustainable management has stimulated a movement for greater recognition of private property rights to attain efficient use and allocation of water. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have encouraged nations in the developing world to conform to a market paradigm by privatizing their water supplies. Affected communities are often less than enthusiastic. Throughout the world, attempts to privatize water resources have triggered a "morality play of rights versus markets, human need versus corporate greed. " The controversy, however, is not limited to developing countries. One of the most divisive issues in contemporary natural resources law in the United States is whether interests in water are property. Absent legally recognized property rights, water markets are unlikely to thrive. According to the Restatement of Property, the term "property" describes "legal relations between persons with respect to a thing. " Of course, not all economic relationships give rise to property rights. Judicial treatment of water is all over the map. The Court of Federal Claims awarded California irrigators millions of dollars as compensation for a regulatory taking of their water rights when flows were curtailed to protect endangered salmon, but a different panel of the same court subsequently took that opinion to task for failing to consider whether interests in water are property. Other federal and state courts have reached contradictory results as well. To unbundle the concept of property in water, this Article uses a web of interests as a strong yet flexible metaphor for property, complemented by a patterning definition representing elemental strands of the web. If the interest in question is not an irrevocable interest in the exclusive possession and use of a discrete, <b>marketable</b> <b>asset,</b> it is not property for purposes of regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment. Viewed through this lens, interests in water in most jurisdictions are not takings property, although they may be a form of property for purposes of due process or common law claim...|$|R

This {{violation of the}} predictions of standard theories of portfolio choice {{is known as the}} 'international diversification puzzle. ' In this paper, we show that the presence of nontraded risk associated with variations in the return to human capital has dramatic implications for the optimal fraction of domestic assets in an individual's portfolio. Our analysis suggests that the returns to human capital are highly correlated with the returns to domestic financial assets. Hedging the risk associated with nontraded human capital involves a short position in national equities in an amount approximately 1. 5 times the value of the national stock market. Thus optimal and value- weighted portfolios very likely involve a short position in domestic <b>marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> ...|$|E

We first characterize these conditions for an isolated intermediary and then generalize them to the case where the intermediary can sell assets to prevent runs. The sale of assets can eliminate runs if the intermediary is solvent but illiquid. However, because of cash-in-the-market pricing, this becomes less likely the more intermediaries are facing problems. In the limit, in case of a general market run, no intermediary can sell assets to forestall a run, and our original solvency and liquidity constraints are again relevant for the stability of financial institutions. ...|$|E

He could not care for her so much as she cared for him! He was a man; men soon forget! Ah! {{but he was not}} like most men. One could not look at his eyes without feeling that he could suffer terribly! In all this her own reputation concerned her not at all. Life, and her clear way of looking at things, had rooted in her the conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a fiction invented by men entirely for man's benefit; a second-hand fetish insidiously, inevitably set-up by men for worship, in novels, plays, and law-courts. Her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the possession of their women unless they could believe that women set tremendous store by sexual reputation. What they wanted to believe, that they did believe! But she knew otherwise. Such great-minded women as she had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation for them was a matter of the spirit, having little to do with sex. From her own feelings she knew that reputation, for a simple woman, meant to stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best. For worldly women--and there were so many kinds of those, besides the merely fashionable--she had always noted that its value was not intrinsic, but commercial; not a crown of dignity, but just a <b>marketable</b> <b>asset.</b> She did not dread in the least what people might say of her friendship with Miltoun; nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade her loving him. She had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered that she had never really loved her husband; she had only gone on dutifully until the separation, from sheer passivity, and because it was against her nature to cause pain to anyone. The man who was still her husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born. She could not marry again, it was true; but she could and did love. If that love was to be starved and die away, it would not be because of any moral scruples.|$|R

However, in other treatments, we observe episodes of rate-of-return dominance,with consistent use of fiat money as a medium of exchange. The results show that two properties of our economies are associated with the rate of return dominance anomaly.

The second is the timing of the dividend payment; when the dividend payment follows the execution of trades between generations, hoarding of the consol occurs {{on the part of the}} old, who earn dividends by hoarding.

"The conventionally measured public sector financial surplus, evenwhen evaluated at constant prices or as a proportion of GNP, presents apotentially very misleading picture of the change in the real net worth of the public sector. One reason is that capital gains and losses on outstanding stocks of <b>marketable</b> financial <b>assets</b> and liabilities are not included in the flow of funds.

A second reason is the omission of revaluations in non-marketable (and often merely implicit) assets and liabilities such as the future stream of tax receipts and the future stream of benefit payments. The paper then proposes some general rules for the design of stabilization policy-policies to facilitate expenditure smoothing by avoiding or minimizing the incidence of capital market imperfections.

In Essay 1, we use experimental methods to study how a fiat money might come {{to be used in}} transactions when an identically <b>marketable,</b> dividend-bearing <b>asset,</b> a consol, is also available. Our experimental economies, which have an overlapping generations structure, have the property that the only stationary rational expectations equilibria (SREE) require exclusive use of the consol as the medium of exchange. In a baseline treatment, agents use the consol exclusively, as would occur in an SREE. However, in other treatments, we observe episodes of rate-of-return dominance, as there is consistent use of fiat money as a medium of exchange. ^ In Essay 2, we replicate and extend the experiment of Fehr and Gaechter (2000) that analyzes the effect of an opportunity to punish others on the level of contributions in the Voluntary Contributions Mechanism. The punishment is costly for both the players distributing and those receiving the punishment. Like Fehr and Gaechter, we find that agents often engage in non-credible costly punishment behavior {{in order to reduce the}} earnings of others who contribute low amounts to the public good. The availability of punishment increases average contributions sharply. Here, we also introduce a second treatment, identical to the first treatment, except that the “punishment” is non-monetary. The assignment of “non-monetary” punishment points does not reduce the payoff of any agent, but it can be used to register disapproval of others 2 ̆ 7 contribution levels. ^ Finally, Essay 3 develops an experiment to study the effect of a complete set of futures markets on the formation of price bubbles in multi-period lived asset markets. Two prominent hypotheses for the existence of the bubble-crash phenomenon are the lack of common expectations and the inability of subjects to backward induct for the entire time horizon of the experiment. If the lack of common expectations is the driving force behind price bubbles, then futures markets should eliminate the bubble by allowing subjects to make trades of the asset in future spot market periods. The contracts for future transactions will allow the subjects to evaluate the market value of the asset in future periods, and thus develop common expectations. The experimental design should also eliminate the problem of subjects 2 ̆ 7 inability to backward induct for the entire 15 periods of the experiment. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
