5|$|The Blancornelas family {{erected a}} huge brick wall in their one-story house to {{increase}} their security measures; outside the house, a squadron of <b>military</b> <b>men</b> guarded the family, while some others protected the Zeta offices. As of 1998, the top editors of the newspaper, along with Blancornelas' three sons, were under guard by the authorities at all times.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his form}} for the Services, Hassett was {{selected}} in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. As the <b>military</b> <b>men</b> played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|New York's {{support for}} the Union cause continued, however grudgingly, and {{gradually}} Southern sympathies declined in the city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the state's industries were more productive {{than those of the}} entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000 soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State, which was the most populous state at the time. A total of 46,000 <b>military</b> <b>men</b> from New York State died during the war, more from disease than wounds.|$|E

5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American <b>military</b> <b>men</b> who {{believed}} that long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E
5|$|The home leg of {{the tour}} was a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the <b>military</b> <b>men</b> played poorly in Australia, the {{national}} selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand. Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment for the women's {{services}} {{began in}} June 1941. Most volunteers were married women, {{many of them}} the wives of <b>military</b> <b>men.</b> The air and military services both offered {{a wide variety of}} positions. In addition to jobs as typists, clerks, caterers and the like, women served as drivers and in the stores and workshops. Many {{of the women in the}} air service did skilled work, checking flying instruments, testing parts and doing minor repairs. The women of the Auxiliary Police Service served as BSAP officers both in stations and on the streets.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders of the}} National Reorganization Process, convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, received presidential pardons, despite popular opposition to them. This was an old request of the Carapintadas in previous years. However, Menem did not apply their proposed changes to the military. The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two <b>military</b> <b>men.</b> Unlike the mutinies that {{took place during the}} presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for a forceful repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by <b>military</b> <b>men</b> {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the {{importance}} of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
5|$|As {{the third}} {{son of a}} cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was {{prepared}} for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and {{came into contact with}} important <b>military</b> <b>men</b> who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, {{by the time he was}} ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.|$|E

5|$|At the 5th National Congress, the Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique amassed {{considerable}} {{power by}} staffing the 5th Central Committee, the 5th Secretariat and the 5th Politburo {{with their own}} supporters. Several moderates and old companions of Hồ Chí Minh, as well as pro-Chinese communists (labelled dismissively as Maoists) and followers of Trường Chinh, {{were removed from the}} Politburo and the Central Committee. The most prominent ouster was that of Võ Nguyên Giáp, the commander at the Battle of Diên Biên Phu. Giáp's removal signaled more the defeat of a rival than of an ideological tendency. Nguyễn Duy Trinh and Lê Thanh Nghị were removed from the Politburo because of their moderate stances, while Trần Quốc Hoàn, Lê Văn Lương and Nguyễn Văn Linh were removed because of their alignment with Trường Chinh. In their place Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ appointed <b>military</b> <b>men,</b> including Đỗ Mười, Lê Đức Anh and General Đồng Sĩ Nguyên. The appointment of Nguyễn Đức Tâm and Nguyễn Cơ Thach strengthened Lê Đức Thọ. The Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique thereafter had a clear majority within the 5th Secretariat.|$|E
5|$|Miler {{started his}} {{campaign}} for Test selection when the servicemen arrived in Perth and played their first match against Western Australia. Miller put in his best batting performance {{of the season with}} an 80 in a drawn match, before being rested in the match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, which again ended in a draw. Miller finally returned to his home town on 2 January 1946 and was reunited with family and friends before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 as the <b>military</b> <b>men</b> fell to an innings defeat, troubled by the off spin of Ian Johnson. Miller and the servicemen had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. Miller faced his biggest challenge in Australian conditions in his quest for Test selection when he went out to bat. The Australian selectors had not been in England for the Victory Tests to witness his ability and Miller had not played to his potential on Australian soil. Local Australian opinion was that because the Services had played poorly in Australia, their achievements in England must have been against poor opposition.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the <b>military</b> <b>men</b> were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{target of}} the privateers were the East Indiamen, huge and well-armed merchant vessels operated by the Honourable East India Company, which controlled British mercantile operations {{to the east of}} Africa. These ships often weighed over 1,000 tons and carried as many as 30 cannon, although their crews were not <b>military</b> <b>men</b> and they could not usually resist a determined attack by a well-trained warship. Despite the size and power of these vessels, they were a primary target for French ships operating in the Indian Ocean as they often carried goods worth thousands of pounds: the annual convoy from China alone was worth over $8 million in 1804. To combat these ships, the British naval authorities at Madras tried a number of solutions, including blockades of the French island colonies which failed due to the huge distances involved, armed military convoys escorting the most valuable ships and small fast cruisers patrolling the most dangerous trade routes. One solution tried in 1806 was to disguise Royal Navy warships as the East Indiamen they superficially resembled in the hope of luring French ships into attacking them, unaware of their true identity.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a {{large volume of}} evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former <b>military</b> <b>men</b> who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} six months, the Mexican Armed Forces were trying to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly {{capturing}} him in two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions by relying on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines {{and members of the}} Gulf Cartel. The intelligence information collected in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento Río in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two <b>military</b> <b>men</b> were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on the logistics of the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros. But before the authorities got to the location, the drug lord left and avoided his capture.|$|E

5|$|In May 1944 {{a series}} of protests against Ubico broke out at the {{university}} in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on June 22, 1944. The protests, which by this point included many middle-class members and junior army officers in addition to students and workers, gained momentum, eventually forcing Ubico's resignation {{at the end of}} June. Ubico appointed a three-person junta led by General Federico Ponce Vaides to succeed him. Although Ponce Vaides initially promised to hold free elections, when the congress met on July 3, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to appoint Ponce Vaides interim president. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration were continued. Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders, who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Árbenz {{had been one of the}} few officers in the military to protest the actions of Ponce Vaides. Ubico had fired Árbenz from his teaching post at the Escuela Politécnica, and since then Árbenz had been living in ElSalvador, organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. Árbenz was one of the leaders of the plot within the army, along with Major Aldana Sandoval. Árbenz insisted that civilians also be included in the coup, over the protests of the other <b>military</b> <b>men</b> involved. Sandoval later said that all contact with the civilians during the coup was through Árbenz.|$|E
