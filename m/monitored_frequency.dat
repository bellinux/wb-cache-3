40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{that allows}} the continuous measurement of concrete E- modulus since casting is presented in this paper. This methodology is a variant to the classical resonant frequency methods, which have the downside of requiring concrete to be de-mouldable and withstand mechanical impact to start testing. The proposed experimental setup comprises a simply supported beam made-up with an acrylic tube, filled with the concrete to be tested, whose mid-span vertical accelerations induced just by ambient vibrations are continuously monitored by an accelerometer. The numerical treatment of the monitored accelerations allows identification of the 1 st resonant frequency of the composite beam, which is evolving as concrete hardens. The E-modulus of concrete can thus be directly obtained from the <b>monitored</b> <b>frequency.</b> Besides {{the description of the}} overall setup, the results obtained in an experiment in which the concrete E-modulus was quantified also through static tests on the beam and via compressive tests in cylinders are presented and discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E
40|$|Whale {{displacement}} by acoustic ‘‘pollution’ ’ {{has been}} difficult to document, even in cases where it is strongly suspected, because noise effects can rarely be separated from other stimuli. Two independent studies on the natural history of killer whales (Orcinus orca) <b>monitored</b> <b>frequency</b> of whale occurrence from January 1985 through December 2000 in two adjacent areas: Johnstone Strait and the Broughton Archipelago. Four high-amplitude, acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) were installed throughout 1993 on already existing salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, in attempts to deter predation on fish pens by harbour seals (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus). While whale occurrence was relatively stable in both areas until 1993, it then increased slightly in the Johnstone Strait area and declined significantly in the Broughton Archipelago while AHDs were in use. Both mammal-eating and fish-eating killer whales were similarly impacted. Acoustic harassment ended in the Broughton Archipelago in May 1999 and whale occurrence re-established to baseline levels. This study concludes that whale displacement resulted from the deliberate introduction of noise into their environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics model is presented, which adds harmonic potentials to the atomic interactions {{to mimic the}} elastic properties of an AFM cantilever. It gives new insight into {{the correlation between the}} experimentally <b>monitored</b> <b>frequency</b> shift and cantilever damping due to the interaction between tip atoms and scanned surface. Applying the model to ionic crystals with rock salt structure two damping mechanisms are investigated, which occur separately or simultaneously depending on the tip position. These mechanisms are adhesion hysteresis {{on the one hand and}} lateral excitations of the cantilever on the other. We find that the short range Lennard-Jones part of the atomic interaction alone is sufficient for changing the predominant mechanism. When the long range ionic interaction is switched off, the two damping mechanisms occur with a completely different pattern, which is explained by the energy landscape for the apex atom of the tip. In this case the adhesion hysteresis is always associated with a distinct lateral displacement of the tip. It is shown how this may lead to a systematic shift between the periodic patterns obtained from the frequency and from the damping signal, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Resting {{sites are}} key {{structures}} for many mammalian species, which can affect reproduction, survival, population density, and even species persistence in human-modified landscapes. As a consequence, {{an increasing number}} of studies has estimated patterns of resting site use by mammals, as well as the processes underlying these patterns, though the impact of sampling design on such estimates remain poorly understood. Here we address this issue empirically, based on data from 21 common genets radiotracked during 28 months in Mediterranean forest landscapes. Daily radiotracking data was thinned to simulate every other day and weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and then used to evaluate the impact of sampling regime on estimates of resting site use. Results showed that lower <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> were associated with major underestimates of the average number of resting sites per animal, and of site reuse rates and sharing frequency, though no effect was detected on the percentage use of resting site types. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> also had a major impact on estimates of environmental effects on resting site selection, with decreasing <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> resulting in higher model uncertainty and reduced power to identify significant explanatory variables. Our results suggest that variation in <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> may have had a strong impact on intra- and interspecific differences in resting site use patterns detected in previous studies. Given the errors and uncertainties associated with low <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies,</b> we recommend that daily or at least every other day monitoring should be used whenever possible in studies estimating resting site use patterns by mammals...|$|R

40|$|We propose surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) resonators as a complementary tool for conditioning film monitoring. Conditioning films are formed by adsorption of inorganic and organic substances on a substrate the moment this substrate comes into contact with a liquid phase. In the case of implant insertion, for instance, initial protein adsorption is required to start wound healing, {{but it will also}} trigger immune reactions leading to inflammatory responses. The control of the initial protein adsorption would allow to promote the healing process and to suppress adverse immune reactions. Methods to investigate these adsorption processes are available, but it remains difficult to translate measurement results into actual protein binding events. Biosensor transducers allow user-friendly investigation of protein adsorption on different surfaces. The combination of several transduction principles leads to complementary results, allowing a more comprehensive characterization of the adsorbing layer. We introduce SAW resonators as a novel complementary tool for time-resolved conditioning film monitoring. SAW resonators were coated with polymers. The adsorption of the plasma proteins human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrinogen onto the polymer-coated surfaces were <b>monitored.</b> <b>Frequency</b> results were compared with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor measurements, which confirmed the suitability of the SAW resonators for this application...|$|E
40|$|Frequency {{control is}} a vital {{component}} of a secure and robust power grid and {{it ought to be}} closely <b>monitored.</b> <b>Frequency</b> control consists of two main components; primary and secondary control and their contributions are usually aggregated in the active power generation data of a plant, which is acquired via Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition. In many cases, such as in Turkey, they are demanded to be evaluated separately due to different impacts on power system or different financial policies. However, this is not usually a straightforward process since primary and secondary response cannot be obtained distinctly. In this work, Extraction of Primary and Secondary Control (EPSCon) algorithm is introduced to extract primary and secondary response over active power generation data. Based on time and frequency domain characteristics of primary and secondary response, EPSCon is developed on a Expectation-Maximization type recursive scheme employing Generalized Cross Correlation and ℓ 1 Trend Filtering techniques. Favorably, EPSCon uses a simple plant model built upon basic governor and plant load controller technical characteristics as an initial estimate of primary and secondary response. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the fracture mechanics theory, then the damaging of material is both in the micro- and macro-plastic area connected with the rise of plastic deformation and hence with the plastic transformation rate which depends on the amount of supplied energy. The power spectral density (PSD) indicating the power at individual frequencies in the <b>monitored</b> <b>frequency</b> band yields information about the supplied amount of energy. Therefore, it can be assumed that there is a dependence between the PSD shape and the size of damage and that the supplied power which is proportional to the value of dispersion s 2 under the PSD curve could be a new criterion for the calculation of fatigue life under combined loading.

INTRODUCTION When setting up land-use monitoring systems, spatial uncertainties {{and their impact on}} the detection of indicator changes are usually ignored.

Here we want to determine the satisfaction of well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients with either three-monthly or six-monthly diabetes monitoring and their future preference. Methods: Survey among 2215 well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients (not using insulin, HbA 1 c Results: Most patients (70. 8 %) would like to continue their <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency.</b> Patients from the preference groups were more often satisfied than randomised patients (92. 7 % and 88. 1 %, respectively) and patients monitored three-monthly were more often satisfied than patients monitored six-monthly (93. 5 % and 88. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Measurements are {{reported}} of the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 m of the Cr 3 + ion in Al 2 O 3 when Ni 3 + and Ni 2 + ions are {{also present in}} very small concentrations. Well-defined reductions in T 1 m are correlated with resonant cross-relaxation between Cr 3 + and Ni 3 + and between Cr 3 + and Ni 2 +. Non-resonant cross-relaxation (NCR) processes are also studied in zero magnetic field and an exponential dependence on temperature is observed. A detailed analysis enables us to suppose that those Ni 3 + ions for which the two lower doublets are split by ~ 6 cm - 1 dominate the NCR process. Also reported is the observation of a reduction in T 1 m when a fast relaxing Ni 3 + or Ni 2 + ion is resonant with à Cr 3 + transition other than that being monitored. Cross-relaxation processes involving three spins — one Cr 3 + and two Ni or vice versa — are also discussed. In samples with less than ~ 0. 03 at. % Cr, cross-relaxation within the Cr 3 + system itself is only important when two or three spins are involved, one of which involves a transition at the <b>monitored</b> <b>frequency.</b> A three-spin Cr 3 + process is observed in which all transition frequencies are different...|$|E

The questionaire again confirmed low level of yogurts and acidophylus drinks consumption. The consumption of white yogurts was confirmed only by 2 % of questioned pupils. Fruit yogurts are more popular among pupils and it is necessary to say that we registred the increase of fruit yogurts consumption in year 2008, mainly in cream fruit yogurts. The daily consumption of these increased with male population from 14. 8 % in year 2004 to 26. 2 % in year 2008. The significant increase of consumtption occured also with female population of half-fat yogurts and the similar trend was also niticed in low-fat fruit yogurts, mainly within the female population.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{clinical}} {{methods for}} monitoring fracture healing are often invasive and inaccurate. This paper evaluates {{the use of}} a pressure sensitive platform to improve monitoring. METHODS: Standardised 3 mm diaphyseal bone defects were created in the right tibia of 64 female sheep and stabilised with either a rigid monolateral external fixator or a more flexible variant. Over a nine week healing period gait parameters were measured using a pressure sensitive platform and interfragmentary movements at the fracture site were <b>monitored.</b> <b>Frequency</b> spectra were calculated for the ground reaction forces. The tibiae were tested biomechanically after sacrifice and callus sections were analysed histomorphometrically. FINDINGS: All animals unloaded the operated and overloaded the contralateral hindlimb. Callus mineralisation and stiffness, as well as limb loading increased during healing whilst interfragmentary movements were reduced. Larger interfragmentary movements resulted in a slower fracture healing rate as documented histologically and biomechanically. Frequency analysis showed upto 14 dB loss of power at frequencies associated with bone mechanotransduction at four weeks postoperatively, reducing to a 3 dB loss at nine weeks. INTERPRETATION: Gait analysis is a valuable tool for monitoring the course of fracture healing. Different fixation stiffnesses caused different initial interfragmentary movements leading to different healing rates. Ground reaction forces were strongly related to the course of callus mineralisation and thus directly reflected the recovery of stiffness at the fracture site. Reduced levels of loading frequencies that may affect bone healing persist to nine weeks postoperatively...|$|E

We conducted analyses to compare adherence assessments and blood glucose monitoring measures with regard to their ability to predict glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We analyzed four instruments to evaluate adherence: Self-Care Inventory-Revised, a self-administered survey; Diabetes Self-Monitoring Profile (DSMP), administered by trained researchers; a categorical (yes/no/sometimes) adherence self-evaluation; and a continuous (0 – 100) adherence self-evaluation. Blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> was evaluated by self-report, diary, and meter download. Results: Participants (n = 82) were aged 39. 0 ± 13. 1 years with a mean diabetes duration of 21. 2 ± 11. 1 years; 27 % monitored blood glucose > 4 times/day. The DSMP score was the strongest predictor of glycemic control (r = − 0. 32, P = 0. 004) among adherence assessments, while blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> assessed by meter download was the strongest predictor among blood glucose monitoring measures (r = − 40, P < 0. 001).
