5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E
5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how <b>much</b> <b>credit,</b> if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|Concerns arose {{internally}} at Disney, {{particularly from}} Roy E. Disney, about studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> {{for the success}} of Disney's early 1990s releases. Disney president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter accident in 1994, and Katzenberg lobbied CEO Michael Eisner for the vacant president position. Instead, tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner, and Disney resulted in Katzenberg being forced to resign from the company that August 24, with Joe Roth taking his place. On October 12, 1994, Katzenberg went on {{to become one of the}} founders of DreamWorks SKG, whose animation division became Disney's key rival in feature animation with both computer animated films such as Antz (1998), and traditionally animated films such as The Prince of Egypt (1998). In December 1994, the Animation Building in Burbank was completed for the animation division.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 {{professional}} seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar {{announced his}} retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets {{in the first}} round, they lost four games to one {{in the second round}} of the playoffs to the Suns. Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout, and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> for the team's successes. Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 year-end {{retrospective}} of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser {{was focused on}} Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what {{the impact of the}} tour would be, but looked optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> to Liliuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained respect for her performance as temporary Regent. Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention. He was praised for his personal qualities of leadership and personality, as well as for his positive interaction with global leaders. A smaller section in same day's newspaper noted that since the journey, there had been a global increase of literary publications pertaining to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of The Witness. Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. The Witness incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with Blow on Braids art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of The Witness. Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse imagery of the island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been able to focus more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
50|$|In {{that same}} year, he was {{appointed}} as the Mayor of Central Singapore District. The post of a Mayor is almost equivalent to a Minister of State but less prestigious. For a first-time Member of Parliament, the leap to the post of Mayor was quite a significant one. When he first entered the Central Singapore CDC, there was less 10 full-time staffs performing limited functions. Today, the Central Singapore CDC is a full-bodied statutory board serving 830,000 residents. Thus, he was very <b>much</b> <b>credited</b> {{to the development of}} the roles of the CDCs and the effective (but debatable) dispersion of funds to the needy.|$|R

The final game narrowly avoided a rainout that would {{have led to a}} Pohnpei victory as Palau only pulled ahead in the late innings. As such, <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> for the victory was given to the Palauan team magician for overcoming the spells of the Pohnpeiian magician.|$|E
25|$|I {{am writing}} {{to ask you}} to {{consider}} the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace– a splendid hitter and most excellent catch– in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team <b>much</b> <b>credit.</b> It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function {{to make it clear that}} no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.|$|E
25|$|Its organists {{have also}} been renowned, {{starting}} with Nicolas Séjan in the 18th century, and continuing with Charles-Marie Widor (organist 1870-1933) and Marcel Dupré (organist 1934-1971), both great organists and composers of organ music. Thus {{for over a century}} (1870–1971), Saint-Sulpice employed only two organists, and <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> is due to these two individuals for preserving the instrument and protecting it from the ravages of changes in taste and fashion which resulted in the destruction of many of Cavaillé-Coll's other masterpieces. The current organists are Daniel Roth (since 1985) and Sophie-Véronique Cauchefer-Choplin.|$|E

25|$|British money {{managers}} were {{driven by a}} complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created {{a false sense of security}} and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> had been extended.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{hardware}} {{stores such as}} Ace Hardware and True Value added customer loyalty programs in order to compete more effectively against larger chains as well as gather customer data.

In addition, office supply retailers Staples and Office Depot started issuing club cards in 2005: they offer rewards in the form of credits towards future purchases on items purchased in the store or online (which items and how <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> changes periodically).|$|E
25|$|The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1960-61 season {{under the}} {{captaincy}} of Frank Worrell.

Though West Indies narrowly lost the series 2-1, with one draw {{in addition to the}} tie, they might easily have won both the last two matches and taken the series 3-1. They took <b>much</b> <b>credit</b> for contributing to such an exciting series and made themselves extremely popular with the Australian public. Prior to their departure from Australia, the team were paraded through Melbourne in open-top cars on 17 February 1961, and were cheered by enormous crowds.|$|E
