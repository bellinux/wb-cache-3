40|$|Mole {{drainage}} is {{an inexpensive}} form of drainage particularly suited to clay soils. Mole drainage is approved by Le Conseil des Productions Vegetales du Quebec to drain clay soils with low hydraulic conductivity. A few known trials on this technique of drainage {{have been done}} in Ontario and Alberta. In England and New Zealand, this technique is widely used. The large surface of heavy clay soil cultivated in Abitibi-Temiscamingue makes this region an excellent choice for trying this technique. Two sites established on two soil series (Palmarolle, Roquemaure) have been moled in Abitibi-Temiscamingue. These soils represent 21 % of the cultivated land in this region. Twelve plots have been moled at varied depths, spaces and lengths. Physical and chemical soil properties have been measured to identify their influence on mole drainage stability. Water table, rainfall and the stability of the <b>mole</b> <b>drains</b> were monitored for three summers. <b>Mole</b> <b>drain</b> stability was observed with a borescope. Maturity growth and yield of a hay crop, and three types of cereals were measured. The mole drainage technique is satisfactory in heavy clay.

This research investigates the importance of phosphorus (P) loss in tile drainage for a mixed agricultural catchment (120 ha) in the UK. Phosphorus concentrations in drain discharge were low (10 1 min- 1). Large sediment-associated particulate P losses were measured during the first major drain-flow events of the autumn.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a series of field trials carried out on two sites, UlfhÃ¤ll and Fiholmsby in SÃ¶dermanland, during the period 1998 - 2000. The aim of the trials was to evaluate the effects of mole drainage as a complement to tile drainage in combination with liming and variation in sowing date. The trial layout induded the following treatments and sowing dates: A = Control B = Mole drainage C = Piped mole drainage 1 = Conventional seedbed preparation with normal sowing date 2 = Conventional seedbed preparation with early sowing 3 = Sowing without harrowing and as early as possible a = Control b = Liming In the mole drainage treatments, the distance between drains was 3. 0 m and the drains were installed at 0. 5 m depth. Treatment b was limed with quicklime (CaO) 6 tons/ha. The plots were ploughed and levelled out in the autumn. Sowing treatments 1 and 2 were harrowed before sowing, while sowing treatment 3 was direct-drilled as early as possible. Yield and quality determinations, seedbed inspections, groundwater level and infiltration measurements and soil physical investigations in the laboratory were carried out for all plots. The soil at the UlfhÃ¤ll and Fiholmsby sites is a heavy to very heavy clay, and the soil at both sites contains some gyttja. At UlfhÃ¤ll, the hydraulic conductivity was very low in the topsoil and high in the subsoil, while at Fiholmsby, the conductivity was high throughout the profile to 80 cm depth. At both sites, the conductivity in the central topsoil of the limed plots increased to twice that in the control treatment. The yield results varied due to extreme variations in weather during the three-year experimental period. 1998 was an extremely wet year, while 1999 the precipitation was normal during the growing season. In 2000, there was a dry spring followed by a cool and rainy summer. The mild, wet winter and spring of 1997 - 1998 meant that the groundwater level in the soil was very high. The <b>mole</b> <b>drains</b> were water-filled for a time, causing some of them to collapse on both sites. The yield results from the trials showed that there were small and non-significant yield differences between treatments except for the first sowing without spring tillage treatment. In that treatment, the yield of grain was on average 10 % lower for a total of 5 harvest years. A pea crop showed yield increases of 8 and 5 % for sowing treatments 2 and 3 respectively. The effect of mole drainage was better on Fiholmsby than UlfhÃ¤ll. There was an average yield increase of 6 % for mole drainage on the Fiholmsby site. Liming produced grain yield increases of 2 and 5 % on UlfhÃ¤ll and Fiholmsby respectively, while it decreased pea yields overall by 8 %. The results of the investigation showed that mole drainage are not suitable on soils where the groundwater in the soil profile can rise to a high level. The <b>mole</b> <b>drains</b> can collapse and one must do the mole drainage over again. One way to avoid the <b>mole</b> <b>drains</b> to collapse are to put drain-pipe inside them.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the load of Escherichia coli transferred via drainage waters from drained and undrained pasture following a grazing period. Higher concentrations (ranging between 104 and 103 CFU g- 1) of E. coli persisted in soil for up to 60 days beyond the point where cattle were removed from the plots, but these eventually declined in the early months of spring to concentrations less than 102 CFU g- 1. The decline reflects the combined effect of cell depletion from the soil store through both wash-out and die-off of E. coli. No difference (P ï³ 0. 05) was observed in E. coli loads exported from drained and undrained plots. Similarly, no difference (P ï³ 0. 05) was observed in E. coli concentrations in drainage waters of <b>mole</b> <b>drain</b> flow and overland plus subsurface interflow. Intermittent periods of elevated discharge associated with storm events mobilised E. coli at higher concentrations (e. g. in excess of 400 CFU ml- 1) than observed during low flow conditions (often < 25 CFU ml- 1).

This is particularly relevant for heavy clay soil systems through which the movement of water is uncertain but {{is thought to be}} rainwater-dominated. The data presented here were collected at a rural site in the south-west of England. The historic rainfall at the site was isotopically varied but similar to the global meteoric water line, with annual weighted means of - 37 for 2 H and - 5. 7 for 18 O and with no seasonal variation.

A simplified {{analysis of}} soil water flow to a <b>mole</b> <b>drain.</b> Journal of Soil Science, 41 (2), 189 - 198. A {{study of the}} leaching of sulphate, chloride, nitrate and the associated cations was carried out over two winter periods on three mole-drained paddocks on a yellow-grey earth (Tokomaru silt loam). The paddocks were occasionally grazed by sheep. At {{the beginning of each}} drainage season potassium chloride (KCl) and sulphur fertilizer, as either single superphosphate (SSP) or elemental sulphur (SÂ°), were applied to two of the paddocks, while the third served as a control. The amount of KCl applied was 200 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while sulphur was applied at 50 kg S ha- 1 in 1988 and 30 kg S ha- 1 1989. Drain flow from the fertilized paddocks was measured with V-notch weirs, and sampled using proportional samplers. Large differences in the total drainage flow were measured in the two years, with values of approximately 280 mm in 1988 and 110 mm in 1989. Significant amounts of the chloride added through both fertilizer and rainfall were leached, amounting to approximately 105 kg Cl ha- 1 yr- 1. The leaching of sulphate-S depended on the form of S fertilizer applied, the quantity of drainage, and the rate of mineralization. Leaching losses of 17 and 3. 4 kg S ha- 1 were measured from the SSP and SÂ° fertilized paddocks, respectively, in 1988, and 9. 4 and 3. 5 kg S ha- 1 in 1989. The study showed that applying SSP just before the drainage season increased leaching losses of sulphate-S substantially. Although the particle sizes of SÂ° used in both years were much bigger than those specified by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of New Zealand, there appeared to be no difference in the yield response to S applied either as SSP or as SÂ°. The reduced leaching of S when applied as SÂ° resulted from the slow oxidation of SÂ° to sulphate-S. Relatively little nitrate-N was leached, the amount ranging from 11 to 17 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Losses of potassium were less than 10 kg K ha- 1 yr- 1, despite the large quantity applied as KCl fertilizer immediately before winter. However a large amount of calcium was leached, between 31 and 52 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. The amount of magnesium leached was between 9 and 15 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. A considerable quantity of sodium was leached, around 58 kg ha- 1 in 1988, and 31 kg Na ha- 1 in 1989, roughly equal to the input in rainfall. Good mass balances were obtained for both chloride and sulphate. The measured moles of negative and positive charge from cations and anions in the leachate were also almost equal. Three models were developed for the leaching of chloride and sulphate-S. An approach dividing the soil water into mobile-immobile phases, and using a fairly detailed soil water flow model was developed. The model was able to simulate the concentration of chloride in the drainage closely, even just after the application of chloride fertilizer, and during highly preferential flow conditions induced by heavy rain. A transfer function model, assuming a log-normal probability density function (pdf) of solute travel pathway lengths, was able to simulate the leaching of chloride reasonably well in 1988. The prediction was less satisfactory in 1989 and during highly preferential flow. By adapting the pdf for chloride to sulphate and by taking adsorption of sulphate into account, the model could predict the sulphate concentration in the drainage quite successfully. A simpler model, using the idea that the two-dimensional flow geometry to the <b>mole</b> <b>drain</b> implies that the drainage concentration approximately equals the average soil solution concentration, was also developed. Despite its simplicity it was able to simulate the leaching of chloride and sulphate as well as the transfer function model.

40|$|The Rowden Moor {{experimental}} site (A. F. R. C. I. G. E. R., North Wyke) {{provided an}} opportunity to characterise discharge regimes, elucidate runoff generation mechanisms and to consider implications for solute movement under natural and drained conditions. Research was conducted on a heavy clay grassland soil {{in an area of}} high rainfall (1053 mm a ËÂ¹) in South West England. A combined hydrometric and tensiometric study was undertaken within a nested experimental design (1 mÂ² to 1 ha) on one undrained and one drained site throughout a drainage season (October to March). Results at the hectare scale demonstrated that drainage did not substantially alter the volume of field runoff (~ 400 mm) but did change the dominant flowpaths. Drainage diverted water from surface/near surface routes to depth so that drain storm runoff was lagged by some 30 minutes over undrained site discharge. The drained site also exhibited a more peaky regime, with a maximum daily discharge of 45 mm being almost twice that for the undrained field. At the field and plot scale, the significance of macropore flow was noted. To investigate this in more detail, a tracer experiment was performed on an isolated soil block which had been <b>mole</b> <b>drained</b> and so had enhanced macroporosity. Macropore flow was generated under unsaturated conditions (little matric potential response and no water table was identified). Stable oxygen concentrations were Î´ 18 O + 3. 5 and - 5. 8 in tracer and background water respectively. Drainflow indicated that there was rapid interaction between applied tracer and soil water (peak flow Î´ 18 O - 1. 1). Thus, the matrix-macropore interface was not a boundary between two separate domains of old and new water, high and low conductivity but a site of rapid interchange and mixing. Temporal variability of soil status and malric water composition, also indicated that limited areas of the matrix were capable of transmitting rapid flow. It became clear that even in a heavy clay soil such as that found at Rowden, where macropore flow was promoted by drainage operations, the matrix still had an important role to play. On the basis of potential, soil moisture and observation of tracers, it is proposed that discrete (finger-like) volumes of the matrix are capable of rapid water transmission. Although it was frequently impossible to relate moisture content and soil water potential because instrumentation monitored different volumes of soil, hysteretic soil moisture behaviour over the drainage season was evident in both data sets. This study confirmed the importance of rapid subsurface runoff generation mechanisms on drained soils, but noted that discontinuous translatory flow in the matrix and macropore flow occurred and that the two âdomainsâ were inextricably linked. Further work should be undertaken at the detailed scale to elucidate the soil characteristics which promote rapid runoff mechanisms and the consequences for water quality, especially where the soil subsurface represents a major reservoir (e. g. nitrates).

40|$|Although {{subsurface}} drainage of pasture soils is widely practiced in New Zealand {{there is little}} information available which details the likely benefits of such drainage schemes. As drainage is becoming increasingly expensive {{there is a need}} for more quantitative data on which to base assessments of the likely cost-effectiveness of proposed schemes. The effect of {{subsurface drainage}} on certain soil and plant properties was investigated at a research site on a sheep and beef farm 6 km from Palmerston North. The soil type was a yellow-grey earth, with poor drainage due to water perching on the fragipan. Of nine plots, each 0. 4 ha in area, three were left undrained and six were <b>mole</b> <b>drained.</b> Three of the drained plots had conventional pipe collecting drains and the other three used major mole channels as collecting drains. The research site was grazed as part of the normal farm rotation. Data were collected in 1981 prior to the installation of drains, then from 1982 to 1984. Watertable levels were monitored in a series of four groundwater observation wells on each plot and the gravimetric water content of the top 30 mm of each plot was determined on a regular basis from soil cores. Soil temperature measurements were made at 50 mm depth on a pipe-mole and undrained plot, using thermistor thermometers, and at 100 mm depth on all the pipe-mole and undrained plots using mercury-in-glass thermometers. Pasture growth rates were measured in caged areas using a capacitance pasture meter and by mowing. Residual pasture left by the grazing animal was determined using small quadrats, the pasture meter and by visual assessment. Botanical composition was determined by point analysis and dissection of samples removed from the caged areas. Available soil nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur in the top 75 ram of each plot, and the total levels of these three nutrients in grass and clover grown on the plots, were measured using standard procedures. Two radioactive isotopes (32 P and 35 S) were used simultaneously to study the plant root activity on the undrained and pipe-mole plots. Data from groundwater observation wells showed that mole drainage was very effective at lowering the watertable following heavy rain in winter or spring. There was no significant difference between water-table depth on the pipe-mole and mole-mole plots. The close proximity of the watertable to the surface on the undrained plots was reflected in high soil water content values for the top 30 mm of soil. Differences in water content of the surface soil between drained and undrained plots did not affect the levels of extractable phosphate, sulphate, ammonium or nitrate or the pH in the top 75 mm of soil. Soil temperature measurements at 50 and 100 mm depth showed that drained plots did not warm any more quickly in spring than did undrained plots. A simple mathematical analysis confirmed that the lowering of the soil heat capacity by drainage would not be expected to affect soil temperature significantly in a yellow-grey earth under pasture. There was little difference in pasture growth rates and utilisation during the very dry winter and spring of 1982, but during mob grazing in the wetter winter of 1983 utilisation was approximately 25 % greater on drained than undrained plots. Subsequently, utilisation of pasture by sheep which were set stocked in spring continued to be poorer on the undrained plots, with approximately 35 % more residual dry matter remaining on the undrained than on the drained plots. From the time of mob grazing in July until the end of spring both mowing and the pasture meter data showed that growth rates were approximately 30 % greater on the drained plots. Point analysis at the end of spring revealed that on the undrained plots there was a 3 -fold increase in the incidence of weeds, a 4 -fold increase in the incidence of bare ground and a 2 -fold decrease in the incidence of clover compared with the drained plots. Almost identical results were obtained from herbage dissections. There was also a decrease in the concentrations of N, P and S in the dry matter of grass and clover grown on the undrained plots compared with that grown on the drained plots. These differences were for the most part small and ephemeral. Isotope uptake studies showed that in winter drainage enabled both grass and clover roots to extract both sulphate and phosphate from a greater depth, with approximately 6 % of the relative root activity occuring at 40 - 80 mm depth on the undrained plots compared with approximately 15 % on the drained plots. In spring, approximately 16 % of the relative root activity was at 80 - 200 mm depth on the undrained plots compared with approximately 26 % on the drained plots. The benefits of drainage became apparent only after grazing on a wet soil and were probably due to the effect that drainage had on the water content and so strength of the surface soil. Drainage increased the bearing strength of the surface soil, minimizing treading damage to both the sward and the soil structure and therefore enhancing both pasture utilisation during grazing, and subsequent regrowth. A simple mathematical model was developed, which used weather data to predict the watertable levels in both drained and undrained soil. By varying certain soil properties and drainage design parameters within the model, the limiting steps in the drainage process in the Tokormaru silt loam were investigated. The model was also designed to calculate the number of days over the winter-spring period on which the surface soil would be so wet that grazing would have the adverse consequences described above. In a year of average rainfall, mole drainage reduced the number of such 'unsafe' grazing days from 69 to 10. By comparing the number of 'unsafe' grazing days for different rainfall regimes some idea of the cost-effectiveness of drainage may be ascertained...|$|R

Such soils are common to the Palaeozoic slates of South West England, and in many parts of Wales and Scotland. The dominance of the fine earth fraction these soils by silt sized particles and the associated low clay fractions (10 - 35 %) gives rise to weak structures that are unsuitable f or <b>mole</b> drainage. Six <b>drains</b> were laid with permeable fill at a 20 m spacing on a gently sloping site at Seale-Hayne College Farm. A year after installation half the site was loosened to a depth of 0. 4 m. The whole site was then cultivated and winter wheat sown. The study concentrated on the modification of the soil physical environment and water transmission routes following loosening operations for autumn re-wetting, the winter period and spring drying. Data collection involved the analysis of drainflow hydrographs and the measurement of soil water physical parameters. Results from an intensive twelve month monitoring period indicate that the modification of subsoil to improve drainage does not necessarily give the results expected. In this study {{it has been shown that}} loosening of an unstable silty clay loam did not enhance drainage, in fact the reverse was true which can have dire consequences in terms of trafficability and plant root growth. Loosening lead to an increased porosity which resulted in a greater, albeit temporary, retention of water within the disturbed zone. This means that loosened soils were wetter prior to a rainstorm and remained so for a longer period after rainfall. This response, in turn lead to significant reductions in soil shear strength, which has important implications for successful crop husbandry in the autumn and spring periods when field operations are necessary. Further work is required to assess the temporal persistence of soil loosening on soil physical conditions and crop responses...|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{nutrients}} to the aquatic environment caused by the irrigation of farm dairy effluent (FDE) is a prominent and contentious feature of dairy farming in New Zealand. This thesis investigates management practices and technologies with potential to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in drainage water from <b>mole</b> and pipe <b>drained</b> dairy pasture soils irrigated with FDE. Farm dairy effluent management was both monitored, using remote sensing technologies, and modelled on a case study farm. During the winter and spring of 2008, an estimated 7, 890 m 3 of FDE was applied {{in excess of the}} soil water deficit (SWD). System constraints were the cause of about two-thirds (5, 070 m 3) of this over-applied FDE volume. It was estimated that as much as 502 kg TN and 83 kg TP could have been lost to surface waters due to inadequate infrastructure. The two main system constraints were the farmâs insufficient FDE storage capacity (2, 000 m 3) and the inability of the farmâs irrigator to apply small application depths (< 8 mm). Furthermore, this study highlighted the significant loss {{of nutrients}} that can occur under FDE irrigation and reinforced the need for tools to assist farmers with FDE management. A number of tools were developed to help farmers manage FDE irrigation. The use of a soil water balance, incorporating actual farm daily rainfall, is an effective method for informing the scheduling of FDE irrigations. Also, the risk of over-application of FDE to soils caused by travelling irrigator breakdowns or stoppages was substantially reduced by the use of a breakdown alert and automatic shut-off system developed and evaluated in this study. Given the elevated risk of P losses from soils treated with FDE, a method of capturing P from drainage waters was investigated. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the ability of Papakai tephra, installed into mole and pipe drainage systems, to remove P from drainage waters. This drainage system reduced TP losses in drainage by about 50 % (c. 0. 14 kg P/ha) over a drainage season, which equated to a 2. 8 kg P reduction for a 20 -hectare effluent block. As farmers frequently crop effluent block soils, the effect of summer forage cropping on nutrient losses was quantified. The practice of spring cultivating long-term dairy pasture, summer forage cropping and autumn regrassing increased the quantity of TN measured in drainage water, over three drainage seasons (2006 to 2008), by 84 % (21 kg N/ha), compared to long-term pasture. If this study had commenced in spring with a more typical pattern of rainfall and drainage, this increase is estimated to have only been about 23. 7 % (5. 9 kg N/ha). Based on these results, summer forage cropping is estimated to increase whole-farm drainage water N losses by about 5 %, when 10 % of a farmâs area is cultivated each year. Of the management practices and technologies studied, the greatest opportunity to reduce the losses of N and P to surface water from the case study farmâs effluent block, is through investment in FDE system infrastructure, particularly adequate storage capacity, and the use of decision support and fail-safe tools to assist the implementation of deficit irrigation of FDE...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been a}} period of great {{expansion}} and land use intensification for the New Zealand dairy farming industry with a 44 % increase in national dairy cow numbers. Intensive dairy farming is now {{considered to be a}} major contributor to the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water resources in some regions of New Zealand. Previous research has demonstrated intensive dairy farming is responsible for accelerated contamination of wateways by nutrients, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and faecal material. A number of common dairy farming practices increase the risk of nutrient leaching. In particular, farm dairy effluent (FDE) has been implicated as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality. With the introduction of the Resource Management Act in 1991, the preferred treatment for FDE shifted away from traditional two-pond systems to land application. However, on most farms, irrigation of FDE has occurred on a daily basis, often without regard for soil moisture status. Therefore, it has been commonplace for partially treated effluent to drain through and/or runoff soils and contaminate fresh water bodies. The objectives of this thesis were to design and implement a sustainable land application system for FDE on difficult to manage, <b>mole</b> and pipe <b>drained</b> soils, and to assess the impacts of FDE application, urea application and cattle grazing events on nutrient losses via artificial drainage and surface runoff from dairy cattle grazed pasture. To meet these objectives a research field site was established on Massey University's No. 4 Dairy farm near Palmerston North. The soil type was Tokomaru silt loam, a Fragiaqualf with poor natural drainage. Eight experimental plots (each 40 x 40 m) were established with two treatments. Four of the plots represented standard farm practice including grazing and fertiliser regimes. Another four plots were subjected to the same farm practices but without the fertiliser application and they were also irrigated with FDE. Each plot had an isolated mole and pipe drainage system. Four surface runoff plots (each 5 m x 10 m) were established as subplots (two on the fertilised plots and two on the plots irrigated with FDE) in the final year of the study. Plots were instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff and the collection of water samples for nutrient analyses. An application of 25 mm of FDE to a soil with limited soil water deficit - simulating a 'daily' irrigation regime - resulted in considerable drainage of partially treated FDE. Approximately 70 % of the applied FDE left the experimental plots with 10 mm of drainage and 8 mm of surface runoff. The resulting concentrations of N and P in drainage and runoff were approximately 45 % and 80 % of the original concentrations in the applied FDE, respectively. From this single irrigation event, a total of 12. 1 kg N ha- 1 and 1. 9 kg P ha- 1 was lost to surface water representing 45 % of expected annual N loss and 100 % of expected annual P loss. An improved system for applying farm dairy effluent to land called 'deferred irrigation' was successfully developed and implemented at the research site. Deferred irrigation involves the storage of effluent in a two-pond system during periods of small soil moisture deficits and the scheduling of irrigation at times of suitable soil water deficits. Deferred irrigation of FDE all but eliminated direct drainage losses with on average < 1 % of the volume of effluent and nutrients applied leaving the experimental plots. Adopting an approach of applying 'little and often' resulted in no drainage and, therefore, zero direct loss of nutrients applied. A modelling exercise, using the APSlM simulation model, was conducted to study the feasibility of practising deferred irrigation at the farm scale on No 4 Dairy farm. Using climate data for the past 30 years, this simulation exercise demonstrated that applying small application depths of FDE, such as 15 mm or less, provided the ability to schedule irrigations earlier in spring and decreased the required effluent storage capacity. A travelling irrigator, commonly used to apply FDE (a rotating irrigator), was found to have 2 - 3 fold differences in application depth and increased the risk of generating FDE contaminated drainage. New irrigator technology (an oscillating travelling irrigator) provided a more uniform application pattern allowing greater confidence that an irrigation depth less than the soil water deficit could be applied. This allowed a greater volume to be irrigated, whilst avoiding direct drainage of FDE when the soil moisture deficit is low in early spring and late autumn. A recommendation arising from this work is that during this period of low soil water deficits, all irrigators should be set to travel at their fastest speed (lowest application depth) to minimise the potential for direct drainage of partially treated FDE and associated nutrient losses. The average concentrations of N and P in both 2002 and 2003 winter mole and pipe drainage water from grazed dairy pastures were all well above the levels required to prevent aquatic weed growth in fresh water bodies. Total N losses from plots representing standard farm practice were 28 kg N ha- 1 and 34 kg N ha- 1 for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total P losses in 2003 and 2004 were 0. 35 kg P ha- 1 and 0. 7 kg P ha- 1, respectively. Surface runoff was measured in 2003 and contributed a further 3. 0 kg N ha- 1 and 0. 6 kg P ha- 1. A number of common dairy farm practices immediately increased the losses of N and P in the artificial drainage water. Recent grazing events increased NO 3 [...] N and DIP concentrations in drainage by approximately 5 mg litre- 1 and 0. 1 mg litre- 1, respectively. The duration between the grazing and drainage events influenced the form of N loss due to a likely urine contribution when grazing and drainage coincide, but had little impact on the total quantity of N lost. Nitrogen loss from an early spring application of urea in 2002 was minimal, whilst a mid June application in 2003 resulted in an increased loss of NO 3 [...] N throughout 80 mm of cumulative drainage suggesting that careful timing of urea applications in winter is required to prevent unnecessary N leaching. Storage and deferred irrigation of FDE during the lactation season caused no real increase in either the total-N concentrations or total N losses in the winter drainage water of 2002 and 2003. In contrast, land application of FDE using the deferred irrigation system resulted in a gradual increase in total P losses over the 2002 and 2003 winter drainage seasons. However, this increase represents less than 4 % of the P applied in FDE during the lactation season. An assessment of likely losses of nutrients at a whole-farm scale suggests that it is standard dairy farming practice (particularly intensive cattle grazing) that is responsible for the great majority of N and P loss at a farm scale. When expressed as a proportion of whole-farm losses, only a very small quantity of N is lost under an improved land treatment technique for FDE such as deferred irrigation. The management of FDE plays a greater role in the likely P loss at a farm scale with a 5 % contribution to wholefarm P losses from deferred irrigation...|$|R
