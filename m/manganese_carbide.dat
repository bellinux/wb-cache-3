5000|$|I {{propose to}} produce a {{superior}} quality of cast steel, by taking ordinary bars of steel, ground as usual, or mixtures of iron or malleable iron and carbonaceous materials, with 1 to 3 parts per hundred by weight of carbide of manganese, and then placing them in a crucible and subjecting them to a heat suitable to melt these materials; when they have become liquid, they can be cast in a mould, in the usual manner. I do not claim {{to be part of}} my invention the use of any of these admixtures of malleable cast iron, or ductile iron and carbonaceous material, but only the use of <b>manganese</b> <b>carbide</b> in any method of converting molten iron to cast steel. J.M. Heath, patent of 5 April 1839 ...|$|E
50|$|Cast iron's {{properties}} are changed by adding various alloying elements, or alloyants. Next to carbon, silicon {{is the most}} important alloyant because it forces carbon out of solution. A low percentage of silicon allows carbon to remain in solution forming iron carbide and the production of white cast iron. A high percentage of silicon forces carbon out of solution forming graphite and the production of grey cast iron. Other alloying agents, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, titanium and vanadium counteracts silicon, promotes the retention of carbon, and the formation of those carbides. Nickel and copper increase strength, and machinability, but do not change the amount of graphite formed. The carbon in the form of graphite results in a softer iron, reduces shrinkage, lowers strength, and decreases density. Sulfur, largely a contaminant when present, forms iron sulfide, which prevents the formation of graphite and increases hardness. The problem with sulfur is that it makes molten cast iron viscous, which causes defects. To counter the effects of sulfur, manganese is added because the two form into manganese sulfide instead of iron sulfide. The manganese sulfide is lighter than the melt, so it tends to float out of the melt and into the slag. The amount of manganese required to neutralize sulfur is 1.7 × sulfur content + 0.3%. If more than this amount of manganese is added, then <b>manganese</b> <b>carbide</b> forms, which increases hardness and chilling, except in grey iron, where up to 1% of manganese increases strength and density.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>carbide,</b> as {{described}} by Heath, was made by heating the crucible {{with a mixture of}} manganese oxide and tar: at high temperature the carbon in the tar causes an oxygen reduction ("redox") in the manganese oxide. Heating the mixture is a costly process, so Heath proposed that his licencees add the manganese and charcoal directly to the crucible so as to make crucible steel. The heat necessary to make the steel also means the charcoal contributes to the redox of the manganese oxide. But although Heath's process removes the need for preparing the carbide separately, it also involves a loss of control over the process. It is difficult to apply his invention in isolation, because making steel in a crucible requires the use of other methods which are always kept as trade secrets [...] - [...] so that other steel producers contested the validity of Heath's patent as describing his actual process. Heath's innovation worked, but nobody would pay royalties on it. After nine years of legal proceedings, the British House of Lords (then the highest court in the land) recognised the patent in its aspect of the first use of manganese oxide. Thomas Webster, one of Heath's lawyers, wrote: Unfortunately, a very great uncertainty is cast over the procedure used to maintain and defend property relating to inventions. The Heath case {{is one of the most}} extraordinary examples of such uncertainty. After twelve years of argument in front of eighteen judges, Privy Counsellors and lords, the result was only that twelve judges, presided over by Lord Brougham and the Lord Chancellor, found for Mr. Heath by seven in favour and six against; of the eleven judges who then heard the case in the House of Lords, in the final trial, seven were in favour and four against.

The {{interaction}} between manganese(II) oxide and carbon in powder mixtures may give <b>manganese</b> <b>carbides,</b> condensed(c) and gaseous(g) manganese at different temperatures and pressures.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of influence of welding time on welding joint creation. Diffusion welding method in inert gas (Ar 4. 8) at low pressure was used. Homogenous welding joints were created from steel E 296 (according to EN ISO 10025 - 2). Homogeneous welds were done for easy assessment of influence of diffusion welding {{time and temperature}} on resulting welding interface, which was closely observed. Due to diffusion of carbon and manganese, on the joint interface were created complex iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>carbides</b> (FeMn) 3 C. It {{was found that the}} amount of created carbides depended on temperature and time. At temperature 1000 °C the biggest quantities of carbides were created, already at time 900 s the continuous carbidic strip was created with thickness 1 - 2 μm. This strip is very brittle and is detrimental to joint properties...|$|R
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form <b>manganese</b> <b>carbides,</b> which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|R

40|$|International audienceActive {{materials}} in batteries suffer from deleterious chemical and structural evolutions during cycling. To follow these modifications, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and associated techniques (EELS, EDX) are of great use. However, these materials can undergo drastic changes under the electron beam. In this study the various microstructural and chemical evolutions induced by electron irradiation were thoroughly investigated at different charging states on a MnO material reacting through the conversion process leading to nanoparticles. During the electron irradiation, compounds pulverization, nanograins growth {{as well as the}} formation of <b>manganese</b> <b>carbide</b> were observed. Consequently, knowing the modifications the sample can undergo under electron irradiation and managing to the best the TEM parameters (spot size, aperture size…) to limit its effect can be of help to avoid misinterpretation and to fully understand the mechanisms, which occur during cycling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{metastable}} τ-phase of MnAl equi-atomic compound {{belongs to}} a family of ferromagnetic alloys with L 1 0 crystal structure. Stabilization of the phase by adding 2 at. % using <b>manganese</b> <b>carbide</b> (Mn 23 C 6) enhances the magnetization in relation {{with the increase in}} lattice volume. It is thus a promising candidate for rare-earth-free permanent magnets. Coercivity of Mn-Al-C alloys being still weak, there is an interest to see to which extend sintering/transformation of the-phase by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) can increase the coercivity and the anisotropy. The structural and the magnetic properties were studied for samples sintered at 550 • C under uniaxial pressure of 100, 200, 300 and 400 MPa. Coercivity, remanence and anistotropy appears with the sintering pressure. The high pressure applied while sintering produces preferential orientation of the flake-shaped grains which influences the remanence...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} a {{crystallizing}} alloy processing {{which makes it}} possible to obtain high-quality castings from 35 GL steel has been considered. It has been shown that the electro impulse treatment of the melt improves the structure and reduces the physical heterogeneity of the castings. Processing of the melt with a current substantially increases the dissolution rate of metallic impurities and other components in the melt, provides a fine-grained structure, increases the homogeneity of the cast metal as well. The structural heterogeneity decreases {{as a result of the}} change in morphology and disorientation and as a result of <b>manganese</b> <b>carbides</b> grinding the size and quantity of the grain ball decrease from 7 to 8. Physical heterogeneity reduces due to the changes in the location and size of pores and nonmetallic inclusions; the content of gases and non-metallic inclusions reduces as well. In this article, studies of the modification of certain parameters by the electric impulse current, have been made. It results in a significant increase in the basic mechanical properties of the 35 GL cast structural steel: the tensile strength increases by 9 %, the toughness increases by 21 %, and the hardness by 6 % without changing the chemical composition of the steel, due to the fine grain structur...|$|R

Manganese acts as a strong stabilizer for the cementite carbide. Chromium seems to stabilize the iron aluminide Fe 2 Al 5 which forms in a considerable amount within an alloy of nominal composition Fe(65) Mn(15) Cr(12) Al(5) Si(2) C(1) (percent by weight).

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) process is used for generating accurate internal profiles in hardened materials. An powder additive in the hydrocarbon dielectric affects the energy distribution and sparking efficiency, and consequently the surface finish and micro-hardness. In this paper the Taguchi approach {{has been used to}} optimize and compare the surface properties in manganese powder-mixed EDM of oil-hardening non-shrinkable (OHNS) and high-carbon high-chromium (D 2) die steels. The results of the study show an improvement of 73 % and 71. 6 % in the micro-hardness of OHNS and D 2 die steels, respectively. The machining parameters for the best value of micro-hardness are found to be the same for both work materials. A scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of the machined surfaces show a transfer of manganese and carbon from the plasma channel in the form of <b>manganese</b> <b>carbide.</b> The chemical composition of the machined surface has been further checked on an optical emission spectrometer to verify and quantify the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} of interest at {{the conception of}} this research project was YInMnO 3, a new bright blue inorganic pigment discovered by Mas Subramanian in 2009. 1 The pigment’s unique reflective properties in the infrared region of light give this compound potential as a passive heat reducer in cool roofing. The project was conceived {{with a desire to}} find alternate routes to synthesis of this promising blue pigment. CuTiO 3 and YInFeO 3, 2, 3 other hexagonal pigments with metal ions in the same trigonal bipyramidal coordination, were made with similar experimental parameters after successful synthesis of YInMnO 3 in the microwave. Previous research has identified microwave-active elements and compounds that heat up rapidly when exposed to microwave energy. Undergraduate student Casey Young profiled various susceptors in the microwave to determine a working susceptor with the capability of heating to 1300 degrees Celsius (the literature temperature required to synthesize YInMnO 3). Thermal profiles were gathered for several susceptors, collecting temperature readings at various power levels and heating interval lengths. The susceptors tested were tungsten oxide, activated and non-activated <b>manganese</b> dioxide, silicon <b>carbide,</b> cupric oxide, activated carbon mesh, and granular carbon slug. Reusability and maximum temperature were both significant limitations. The susceptor that proved most optimal for synthesis was carbon slug 6 - 8 mesh, which rose to 1350 degrees Celsius and was reusable after successive heatings. Casey Young determined the optimal parameters for microwave synthesis, including crucible type, crucible dimensions, type of susceptor, amount of susceptor, microwave power level, duration of heating intervals, and amount of heating intervals necessary for successful synthesis. After Casey Young determined ideal microwave synthesis conditions, the student ran several trials to synthesize YInMnO 3 and YCuTiO 3 and analyzed phase-purity via XRD to find optimal heating time. Using the parameters outlined by Casey Young, undergraduate student colleague Omar Rachdi ran trials of YInFeO 3 to find optimal heating time for synthesis. Casey Young and Omar Rachdi then constructed a poster for CUE 2013 and presented to the general public on May 15 th, 2013. The findings of this project are significant because it shows alternative synthesis routes for YInMnO 3 and other pigments of similar structure. The conventional synthesis of YInMnO 3 in a furnace requires three full days of heating; microwave synthesis of this compound was shown to reduce the synthesis time to under 2 hours. This reduced heating time holds potential to reduce production cost of YInMnO 3, giving this environmentally beneficial pigment greater economic potential. 1. 	Smith, A. E. et al.
