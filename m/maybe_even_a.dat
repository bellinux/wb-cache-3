Sir William Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> ring. For nearly fifty years, Herschel's instrument was the only one the moons had been seen with. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favourable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Publications hesitated between William Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck.|$|E

In 1987, when asked if she would ever leave the character of Jill again, Dickson stated: [...] "I'm planning to branch out, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> miniseries.

[...] Ratliff continued, [...] "If you've listened to much hard bop or mainstream jazz of the early '60s, you might find some easygoing clichés in his playing - or <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> awful lot of them - but they are smoothly rendered.

500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E

Porter {{went on to}} praise the acting work of both B. J. Novak and Paul Lieberstein, {{as well as the}} writing of Mindy Kaling. TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, so true, Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess I {{knew it was going to}} be a good episode of The Office when I had two pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed to the success of the episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling. She also praised the storyline of the episode that did not involve Michael and Dwight, saying [...] "The second plotline was its usual funny filler.

500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. <b>Maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Straja dragonilor also {{includes}} first-hand detail on Negoiţescu's fascist episode, including {{the circumstances of}} his several contributions to the Iron Guardist press and the joy he experienced in late 1940, when the movement managed to assassinate historian and politician Nicolae Iorga. The interval is explained by the memoirist as being related to his identity crisis: [...] "I was being driven by a terrible vital demon, an unprecedented impulse for affirmation, <b>an</b> acute individualism, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> instinctual tendency for domination, all later curbed by my homosexuality, which imposed timidity on me, and eventually by the rigors of history". Despite this particular frankness, Bogdan Creţu suggests, the book effectively minimized Negoiţescu's involvement with the fascist causes, by making them seem less relevant to his biography than they actually were.|$|R
