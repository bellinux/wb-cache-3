On {{the basis}} of {{undertaken}} analytical and experimental studies intercommunication is set between chemical, phase and structural composition, technological parameters of treatment and level of properties of casting multicomponent alloys of the system Al - Mg.

50|$|<b>Magnalium</b> is an {{aluminium}} alloy with magnesium and {{small amounts of}} nickel and tin. Some alloys, intended for particular uses {{at the cost of}} poor corrosion resistance, may consist of up to 50% magnesium. It finds use in engineering and pyrotechnics.|$|E
50|$|In 1893 Arthur Edward Waite {{translated}} Pandora <b>magnalium</b> naturalium aurea et benedicta into English as A Golden Casket of Nature's Marvels. It contains The Book of the Revelation of Hermes {{interpreted by}} Theophrastus Paracelsus Concerning the Supreme Secret of the World, and tracts by Figulus, Alexander von Suchten, Conrad Poyselius, and others.|$|E
50|$|The main {{bearings}} {{were made of}} <b>magnalium,</b> an aluminium alloy with 5% magnesium. The crankcase was also made of aluminium. The four cylinders, cast in grey iron with fixed heads, gave a total displacement of 5.918 L (116 mm bore, 140 mm stroke), and were arranged in pairs each pair with a single spray-nozzle carburetor. The intake and exhaust valves were no longer opened by cylinder pressure but by two camshafts {{on the sides of}} the engine, driven by gears from the flywheel. There were two carburetors, one for each cylinder-pair.|$|E
50|$|Returning to Ilford (1942, aged 7) he {{experienced}} more aircraft bombs, usually dropped {{under cover of}} night, and he started a collection of fragments of bombs and of anti-aircraft shells. His searches rewarded him with the occasional <b>magnalium</b> incendiary bomb of which the bodies later provided a welcome source of metal for his earliest fireworks. Alford's interest in explosives and pyrotechnics was born. On one occasion Alford found a complete flying bomb engine in Epping Forest. He {{had the opportunity to}} hear and observe the V-1 flying bomb ("Doodlebugs") and V2 rockets and was able to compare and contrast their effects.|$|E
50|$|Magnesium occurs {{naturally}} only {{in combination}} with other elements, where it invariably has a +2 oxidation state. The free element (metal) can be produced artificially, and is highly reactive (though in the atmosphere, it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity — see passivation). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light. The metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine, and is used primarily as a component in aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called <b>magnalium</b> or magnelium. Magnesium is less dense than aluminium, and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and strength.|$|E
50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as <b>magnalium</b> {{may be used}} to create sparks. The {{quantity}} and style of sparks produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by spark testing. In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel — about 0.7% is best for large sparks. The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching sparks. The color of sparks used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the sparks are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the sparks. The duration a spark’s existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting spark.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} {{generally}} more expensive than aluminium, the high strength, low density, and greater workability of alloys with low amounts of magnesium leads to their use in aircraft and automobile parts. Alloys with about 50% magnesium are brittle and corrode easily, which makes them unsuitable for most engineering uses. However, these alloys are flammable when powdered, are more resistant to corrosion than pure magnesium, and are more reactive than pure aluminium and are therefore used in pyrotechnics as a metal fuel and to produce sparks. <b>Magnalium</b> powder also burns with a crackling sound if burnt by itself, and provides a good compromise between the reactivity of magnesium, and the stability of aluminium. Another benefit for pyrotechnics is the brittleness of the alloy, as mentioned before. It is easily broken with a hammer and then ground in a coffee grinder to usable powder. It will grind in a ball mill into a fine powder {{in a matter of}} hours, as opposed to a matter of days with aluminium powder.|$|E
40|$|Agglomeration {{reduction}} {{techniques are}} important field in solid propellant industry, Large agglomeration results in excessive two phase losses. Tailored composite particles {{has been applied}} to tailor aluminum particle ignition and combustion. In this research, mechanical activated aluminum magnesium powders are synthesized, tested in both laser ignition using CO 2 and propellant. Prepared powders categorized into particle size that suitable for propellant application. Laser ignition tests showed that the prepared powder are more reactive than <b>magnalium</b> which has the same Al:Mg weight ratio. Agglomeration capturing showed that the prepared powder produce much less than neat aluminum or even similar physical mixture of aluminum and magnesium. The burning rate of propellant using the prepared powder is increased. ^ MA Al/Mg powders as long as with comparable physical mixture are applied in propellant formulation with AP/HTPB. In order to quantify the effect of changing Mg percent. Burning rate is measured from videos captured for strand burning in windowed pressure vessel, also the agglomeration was capturing using special setup. The results showed that MA powder increase burning rate and this increase reach maximum at 50 % Mg, while propellant using physical mixture of Al/Mg show constant or little decrease in burning rate. In addition, the MA powder show lower agglomeration size in comparison to neat aluminum propellant or physical mixture with the same Mg percent. The lowest agglomeration sizes were for MA 50. However, equilibrium calculation showed 4 sec losses in specific impulse, so MA 70 was chosen as a compromise between low agglomeration size at the minimum loss in specific impulse. ^ <b>Magnalium</b> is an alloy of aluminum and magnesium and it is known for its ease of ignition and high oxidation energy content. It {{has been used as a}} metal fuel to increase burning rates of composite modified double base (CMDB) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) composite propellants. However, the ignition temperature is larger than the comparable mechanically activated (MA) Al-Mg powder. ^ Mechanical milling was performed on <b>magnalium</b> powders and modifications of structure and morphology of the alloy during milling were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The prepared <b>magnalium</b> powder was used in a solid propellant, which showed higher burning rates than those containing as-received <b>magnalium.</b> Furthermore, milled <b>magnalium</b> showed higher agglomeration reduction than both as received <b>magnalium</b> as well as MA Al-Mg powders. ^ Extend the application of mechanical alloying of aluminum to other metals with extreme difference in melting/ boiling temperature, the first is Zirconium which is a long time candidate in solid propellant community. The ease of zirconium ignition and the micro-explosive behavior shown by neat zirconium particles promote its usage in agglomeration reduction effort. the other metal is Indium, which has very low melting point compared to other metal, this may open the possibility of earlier reaction of aluminum particles at or near propellant surface resulting in less pre ignition time which reduce agglomeration tendency. ^ MA of 90 % Aluminum and 10 % of Zirconium or 10 % Indium using High energy ball milling, particle characterization using SEM/FIB, XRD and DSC/TGA are performed, burning rate and agglomeration size analyses of solid propellant using sieved MA-powder are done. The results showed that the both MA Al-ZR and MA Al-In ignite in laser beam which verify change in reactivity from neat aluminum with its protective alumina coating. However, burning rate results show no change in burning rate from neat aluminum, also the prepared material shows no reduction in agglomeration sizes...|$|E
40|$|Many strobe {{compositions}} {{were discovered}} {{in the past but}} only a few have been studied and none of them were fully understood. This article aimed at introducing the ternary composition of ammonium perchlorate as oxidizer, <b>magnalium</b> as fuel, and barium sulfate as metal salt. Parameters that influence its performances are analyzed. First, the binary compositions ammonium perchlorate/magnesium and ammonium perchlorate/magnalium were studied to observe the differences in behavior by using <b>magnalium</b> instead of magnesium. Next, variations were applied to the ternary composition changing the fuel: oxidizer:metal salt ratio. Finally the effect of potassium dichromate was analyzed. It is often added to the composition because it is known to improve the regularity and sharpness of flashes. The burning behavior was recorded using a high speed camera, together with emission spectra using a Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) camera coupled with a spectrometer and the temporal evolution of the intensity with a photodiode coupled with an oscilloscope. The results of the experiment give first insights into the physical and chemical mechanisms and give directions to the further study on strobe reactions. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Abstract. The periclase-hercynite brick {{performance}} after different re-firing cycles was researched {{under different}} atmosphere. The results are shown {{that under the}} oxidizing atmosphere, the brick after re-firing {{would lead to the}} mutual diffusion of iron ions in both magnesium substrate and hercynite particles, which would further lead to ring cracks around hercynite. After the brick was re-firing at CO atmosphere, the mutual diffusion of magnesium and iron ions was even more severe, which formed magnitude of magnesia-hercynites and <b>magnalium</b> spinels. SEM results are shown that the porous structure around the hercynite could damage more severe...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} {{scheme for}} selecting characterization parameters of boron-based fuel-rich propellant formulation was put forward; a calculation model for primary combustion characteristics of boron-based fuel-rich propellant based on backpropagation neural network was established, validated, {{and then was}} used to predict primary combustion characteristics of boron-based fuel-rich propellant. The {{results show that the}} calculation error of burning rate is less than ± 7. 3 %; in the formulation range (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene 28 %– 32 %, ammonium perchlorate 30 %– 35 %, <b>magnalium</b> alloy 4 %– 8 %, catocene 0 %– 5 %, and boron 30 %), the variation of the calculation data is consistent with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Experimental dependences on {{the effect}} of the drop volume from the contact angle under the {{conditions}} of the static three-phase contact line formation during wetting the non-ferrous metals (aluminium, <b>magnalium,</b> copper and brass) are presented in the work. The surface of the substrates was investigated by modern equipment (profilometer "Micro Measure 3 D station" and microscope TM- 3000). The drop was placed on the surface by the precision electronic single-channel pipette (Thermo scientific). Shadow method was used to obtain the drop profile; symmetry of the drop was controlled by Schlieren method. The comparison of the methods used to determine the contact angle on the image of the drop profile was executed. It was established that in spite of influencing the friction and gravity forces the structure of metal surfaces affects greatly the value of the contact angle...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{pyrotechnic}} {{time delays}} {{are based on}} powder mixtures pressed into tubes of precise lengths. Pyrotechnics based on filled polymer systems may offer some advantages. This includes continuous manufacture via extrusion processes. Thermoplastic-based pyrotechnic compositions can be formulated by filling conventional polymer matrices with oxidants such as potassium nitrate. More interesting are fluoropolymer matrices as these strong oxidants enable the design of non-gassing systems with suitable fuels. The presence of fillers dramatically increases the melt viscosity. The random packed limit for monodisperse spherical particles corresponds to a volume fraction of 0. 637 (Krieger, 1959). Pyrotechnic compositions with oxidant filler volume fractions below this critical level are only viable for conventional polymers with very high C:H atomic ratios, e. g. polystyrene. Pyrotechnic compositions comprising of filled thermoplastics were simulated using EKVI thermodynamic software. This allowed for the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperatures, variation of the product composition and gas evolved with varied filler content. The EKVI thermodynamic simulations showed that polystyrene filled with potassium nitrate or potassium permanganate were unlikely to be viable as global maximum temperatures were not achieved below 78 vol. %. A fully fluorinated polymer filled with aluminium, magnesium, <b>magnalium</b> and calcium carbide were shown to be viable between 20 wt. % and 70 wt. % reducing agent. Co-polymers of tetrafluoroethylene and vinylidene fluoride filled with aluminium or magnesium showed similar adiabatic temperatures as compositions based on perfluorinated polymers with the same reducing agents. The energy required to decompose the thermoplastic binder would, however, lower {{the amount of energy}} available for the pyrotechnic reaction. Open flame burn test showed that the polystyrene-based compositions did not generate enough energy to decompose the thermoplastic fraction to sustain chemical reaction. Viton B filled with calcium carbide could not sustain burning. Compositions using aluminium and <b>magnalium</b> with Viton B as oxidant sustained burning over the range 20 wt. % to 60 wt. %. The effect of morphology was tested by using two grades of aluminium; atomized aluminium, and flake-like aluminium particles. Energy measurements of Viton B filled with aluminium and <b>magnalium</b> indicated that the maximum energy output occurred in the range 30 wt. % to 40 wt. % fuel for aluminium-based compositions and between 40 wt. % and 50 wt. % for magnalium-based compositions. A maximum burn rate of 82 mm s 1 was achieved using a magnalium/Viton B composition. Friction and impact test showed that the compositions are insensitive. XRD analysis of the combustion residue of Viton B-based compositions using aluminium as fuel showed that the most abundant products formed were Al 4 C 3, AlF 3, carbon and an amorphous phase. An elemental balance indicated that the amorphous phase consisted of carbon, aluminium and fluorine. The XRD spectra of the residues of magnalium-based compositions had unidentified reflections. Quantitative XRD was, therefore, not possible on the reaction products of the magnalium-based compositions. TGA analysis on the combustion residue indicated that the combustion residue contained unreacted reagents. Scanning electron microscopy of the reaction residue revealed the presence of agglomerated cubic particles. EDX analysis indicated that the cubic particles consisted of aluminium and fluorine.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of aluminium- or magnalium-filled fluoropolymer Viton B as an open-burn time delay was investigated. Film samples with a thickness of 245 ± 21 lm were prepared via a slurry casting process. Fuel filler content was varied from 20 to 60 mass/%. The films retained the elastic {{properties of the}} parent polymer except that the elongation at break decreased rapidly with increasing filler content. Sensitivity tests showed that the films were insensitive to ignition by friction and impact. EKVI thermodynamic simulations showed that, for both systems, the maximum energy output is ca. 8. 3 MJ kg- 1. Energy measurements indicated that the maximum energy output occurred in the range 30 – 40 mass/%. Maximum burn rates of 82 and 40 mm s- 1 were achieved using a <b>magnalium</b> and flake aluminium as fuels, respectively.

40|$|Strobe {{compositions}} {{belong to}} the class of solid combustions. They are mixtures of powdered ingredients. When ignited, the combustion front evolves in an oscillatory fashion, and flashes of light are produced by intermittence. They have fascinated many scientists since their discovery {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century. However, the chemical and physical processes involved in this curious oscillatory combustion remain unknown. Several theories have been proposed: One claims that two different reactions occur: one during the slow dark phase and another during the fast flash phase. The alternation between the phases is ascribed to heat variations. Other theories suggest that the formation of intermediate species during the dark phase and the change of phase are caused by variations in their concentration. A ternary strobe composition with ammonium perchlorate, <b>magnalium,</b> and barium sulfate is analyzed. The role of barium sulfate is studied by replacing it by other metal sulfates that have different physical properties (melting points), and the burning of the compositions is recorded with a high-speed camera and a spectrometer coupled with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Experimental results show noticeable differences in the physical and chemical processes involved in the strobe reaction...|$|E
40|$|Strobes are {{pyrotechnic}} compositions that emit bright {{flashes of}} white or colored light at regular time intervals. The strobe effect has applications in various fields, {{most notably in}} the fireworks industry and in the military area (signaling – missile decoys – crowd control). However, the chemical and physical mechanisms involved in this curious combustion phenomenon remain unknown. This study investigates parameters that influence the strobe effect (frequency, sharpness of flashes). Variations were applied to the fuel particle size and weight fraction of the ternary composition ammonium perchlorate, <b>magnalium</b> (fuel) and barium sulfate. Both parameters {{are related to the}} heat generation and transfer within the composition. The light emission was recorded with photodiodes and a high speed camera (5000 fps). The experimental results served as input for a model to explain the strobe behavior based on layer-by-layer combustion. Moreover, it was established that the flash frequency is dependent on a delicate balance between heat generation in one layer and heat transfer to a next layer. The model gives new insights into the behavior of pyrotechnic strobes and enables a better control of the flash frequency by variation of the size and content of the metal fuel particles...|$|E
40|$|Strobes are {{self-sustained}} oscillatory combustions {{that have}} various {{applications in the}} fireworks industry {{and also in the}} military area (signaling, missile decoys and crowd control). However, most of the strobe compositions were discovered using trial and error methods. The fundamentals mechanisms involved in strobe remain unclear. A few oscillatory chemical systems were reviewed in in this thesis and compared to strobe reactions. First, the oscillatory behavior observed in some of the systems (BZ type reactions and cool flames) was explained by the presence of intermediate species that are created and consumed by two chemical pathways. They compete with each other and it results in an oscillation of the concentration of the intermediate species. Then, to explain the oscillatory behavior observed in some SHS (Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis) combustion, the assumption made was that if the reaction time is much larger than the characteristic time of heat transfer. Those two features were considered in the analysis of strobe reaction. The classical ternary strobe composition made of ammonium perchlorate / <b>magnalium</b> / barium sulfate was studied in this thesis. The following physical mechanisms were observed. After ignition of the composition, there is the formation of a layer on top of the pellet. This layer is heated up by a reaction and begins to melt. When the flash is imminent, parts of the surface layer are ejected indicating the formation and rapid expansion of gas below the surface. A bright flash follows after which the process is repeated. The pellet is consumed almost linearly, layer by layer. Some of the chemical mechanisms of this strobe were identified. The decomposition of ammonium perchlorate present in the layer ignited produces the heat and the oxygen molecules necessary for the strobe reaction to proceed. Then the <b>magnalium</b> begin to melt and decomposes into aluminum and magnesium. Finally, the oxidation of liquid and gaseous aluminum and magnesium were observed. The same reactions occur in the next layer. Parameters that influence the strobe effect were emphasized. First, the effect of potassium dichromate was studied. A small amount of this compound in the compositions has an important impact on the regularity and sharpness of flashes. It was hypothesized that the decomposition of this compound during the dark phase absorbs part the energy released, restraining the increasing reaction rate. Then, the influence of the melting point of the metal sulfates or nitrates was studied. It appears that the compositions containing high melting point metal sulfates (barium and strontium sulfates) produce sharper and more regular flashes. Those compositions also have a slower frequency. Finally, the influence of the heat transfer of the composition on the strobe behavior by varying the fuel weight fraction and its particle size. It appears that compositions with a lower heat transfer in the composition results in a lower flash frequency. Besides, it was noticed that none of those parameters seemed to have a strong influence on the temperature of the compositions while burnin...|$|E
