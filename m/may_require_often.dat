40|$|This month, {{we discuss}} three papers which publish {{the results of}} trials into {{potential}} treatment approaches to myasthenia gravis (MG). When treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors alone fails to control symptoms, treatment with steroids <b>may</b> be <b>required,</b> <b>often</b> at high doses which are often associated with adverse side effects both in the short and long term. All the studies explore treatments that may replace or {{reduce the need for}} steroids in MG and use the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and prednisone dose requirement as primary or secondary outcomes. The first paper reports results of a randomised trial of routine thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG patients, the results of which may see this procedure incorporated into routine management of non-thymomatous MG. The second and third papers explore alternative steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. At present, the only medications shown to be effective in randomised placebo-controlled studies are azathioprine and cyclosporine, but both carry the risk of adverse reactions and have a requirement for close monitoring. The second study compares methotrexate and prednisone treatment to prednisone alone and the final study assesses effectiveness of leflunomide. All three studies represent a valuable addition to the literature on treatment of a condition that currently has limited alternatives to long-term immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks {{attempt to}} consume a server’s {{resources}} (network bandwidth, computing power, main memory, disk bandwidth etc) to near exhaustion {{so that there}} are no resources left to handle requests from legitimate clients. An effective solution to defend against DoS attacks is to filter DoS attack requests at the earliest point (say, the web site’s firewall), before they consume much of the server’s resources. Most defenses against DoS attacks attempt to filter requests from inauthentic clients before they consume much of the server’s resources. Client authentication using techniques like IPSec or SSL <b>may</b> <b>often</b> <b>require</b> changes to the client-side software and <b>may</b> additionally <b>require</b> superuser privileges at the client for deployment.

In this framework perspectives and barriers of multiple relevant actors in multiple processes and arenas are combined.

While users may believe in conflicting facts (due to conflicting sources, measurements or opinions), current online databases {{do not offer}} support {{for the management of}} data conflicts. Thus online databases could clearly benefit from technology for uncertain/incomplete databases. However, prior works on uncertain databases are of limited help when designing a conflict-aware online database, for two reasons: First, their performance degrades rapidly as the number of conflicting facts escalates, which can be the case in large user communities. Second, they were built as storage models, resulting in data models that are either non-simple or non-compact and thus <b>may</b> <b>require</b> additional, <b>often</b> non-trivial processing before they appear in the Frontend of an online database.

It achieves this by coordinating a novel conflict-aware data model (shown to be both compact and simple) with respective efficient query answering algorithms, that allow the system to scale to a large number of data conflicts (as evidenced by a performance comparison against Trio and MayBMS; two recent research prototypes for uncertain data).

Suspension <b>may</b> <b>require</b> and <b>often</b> has a small group who handle preparations and the process itself. The actual act of being suspended may take up a tiny portion of time compared to the time involved in preparation, though some people remain suspended for hours. The suspendee's body is studied to decide the proper placement, number, and size of metal hooks which are pierced into the skin to lift the person off the ground. Depending on the position in which the body is to be suspended, multiple hooks are sometimes located around the shoulders, upper arm, and back, as well as around the knees. Finding the proper hook placement and number involves basic geometry and an acute understanding of human anatomy and physiology, as well as the durability of the individual's skin. If the number of hooks are too few, the suspended individual's skin will be unable to withstand the body's weight and will rip. [...] The amount of weight that each hook supports must be distributed evenly throughout the entire body. A block and tackle-like machine made for suspension is used, and rope that attaches to the hooks is used to slowly and carefully lift an individual a foot or two off the ground — where they may remain relatively motionless for a predetermined period of time. Some also choose to have more dynamic suspensions, where they swing or are pushed around the area.|$|R
