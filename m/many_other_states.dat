25|$|At that time, Alabama and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>states</b> had {{to change}} their {{legislative}} districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts.

Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.|$|E
