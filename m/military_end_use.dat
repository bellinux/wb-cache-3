40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In summary, DOD's Office of the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to cancel its competitive solicitation for 21 civilian Mi- 17 s because Russian authorities told DOD in late 2010 that, in accordance with Russian law, they would sell the helicopters only through Rosoboronexport since they were intended for <b>military</b> <b>end</b> <b>use.</b> Specifically, in response to letters written by the U. S. Ambassador to Russia, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed to DOD that it considered the Mi- 17 s to be military because they were {{for use by the}} Afghan Air Force, and therefore could be sold only through Rosoboronexport, the sole entity responsible for Russian military exports. ...|$|E

50|$|During World War II, the United States {{military}} purchased {{about two}} thirds of Vieques as an extension to the Puerto Rican mainland's Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, including the area surrounding the Puerto Ferro Lighthouse. The US Navy continued to use the island for military exercises after the war. After a series of protests starting in 1999, the U.S. <b>military</b> <b>ended</b> the <b>use</b> of its facilities on the island in 2003. The Puerto Ferro Lighthouse {{is now part of}} the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge.|$|R
500|$|In 1912–1913 {{a series}} of fatal crashes of Wright {{airplanes}} bought by the U.S. Army called into question their safety and design. The death toll reached 11 by 1913, half {{of them in the}} Wright model C. All six model C Army airplanes crashed. They had a tendency to nose dive, but Orville insisted that stalls were caused by pilot error. He cooperated with the Army to equip the airplanes with a rudimentary flight indicator to help the pilot avoid climbing too steeply. A government investigation said the Wright C was [...] "dynamically unsuited for flying", and the American <b>military</b> <b>ended</b> its <b>use</b> of airplanes with [...] "pusher" [...] type propellers, including models made by both the Wright and Curtiss companies, in which the engine was located behind the pilot and likely to crush him in a crash. Orville resisted the switch to manufacturing [...] "tractor"-type propeller aircraft, worried that a design change could threaten the Wright patent infringement case against Curtiss.|$|R
50|$|The 19th TRS {{remained}} at Bruntingthorpe {{for almost three}} years until the summer of 1962. At that time, {{it was decided to}} forward deploy the squadron to the then-unused Toul-Rosières Air Base, France. The first aircraft departed for France on 22 July, with the final aircraft departing by the end of August. With the departure of the B-66s, the USAF turned over control of Bruntingthorpe to the British Ministry of Defence on 28 September, and this <b>ended</b> <b>military</b> <b>use</b> of the facility.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport was}} built in 1958 to support Cape Sarichef Air Force Station, a Cold War United States Air Force Distant Early Warning Line radar station. The station was {{operated}} by Detachment 3, 714th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Cold Bay Air Force Station, near Cold Bay, Alaska. The radar station was inactivated in September 1969, <b>ending</b> <b>military</b> <b>use</b> of the airport. The Air Force remediated the site around 2000, removing all abandoned military structures and returning the site to a natural condition.|$|R
50|$|Originally opened as Fort Morrow Army Airfield, the {{facility}} was closed after World War II {{and returned to}} civilian status. Beginning in 1958 the airport was used to support Port Heiden Air Force Station, a Cold War United States Air Force Distant Early Warning Line radar station. The station was operated by Detachment 5, 714th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Cold Bay Air Force Station, near Cold Bay, Alaska. The radar station was inactivated in September 1969, <b>ending</b> <b>military</b> <b>use</b> of the airport.|$|R
50|$|After the war ended, {{the base}} was closed in April 1919 {{and was used}} as an Army storage depot. <b>Military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended</b> in 1921, and the {{facility}} was eventually dismantled and returned to farmland. Over the years, the southern suburbs of Fort Worth have expanded over the area, the airfield now is indistinguishable from the urbanized area. Barron Field was located south of Everman Parkway and west of Oak Grove Road. One small building, used for munitions, has survived, and today a Texas historical marker is located at the site {{on the west side of}} Oak Grove Road.|$|R
50|$|Fort Apache Historic Park (Tł’óghagai in Apache) is {{a tribal}} {{historic}} park of the White Mountain Apache, {{located at the}} former site of Fort Apache in the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The park interprets the rich and troubled history of relations between the Apache and other Native American tribes at the fort, which was converted into a Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school after its <b>military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended.</b> The park, which covers 288 acre of the former fort and school, {{as well as a}} nearby military cemetery, form the National Historic Landmark Fort Apache and Theodore Roosevelt School historic district.|$|R
5000|$|American Army units {{moved into}} the area in early April 1945, seizing the {{airfield}} with little resistance. The IX Engineering Command 825th Engineering Aviation Battalion arrived on 8 April and declared Langensalza operational, designating the airfield as Advanced Landing Ground [...] "R-2". C-47 Skytrain transports began flying {{into and out of}} Langensalza, carrying in supplies and equipment to support the combat units moving east, and evacuating casualties to rear areas on the return flights. [...] Late in the war, on 22 and 24 April, Ninth Air Force combat units, with P-38 Lightnings of the 474th Fighter Group and P-61 Black Widows of the 422d Night Fighter Squadron moved in, conducting operations until the end of combat on 7 May. The 474th Fighter Group remained at the airfield until 16 June 1945 when it moved out, <b>ending</b> <b>military</b> <b>use</b> of the airfield.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its military function, {{it has been used}} over the years for exhibitions, boxing matches, and a film set. After World War II the city offered it to the United Nations as a temporary meeting place. In 1974 it was designated a city landmark, and eight years later it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its <b>military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended</b> and it was turned over to city management in 1996. Since then it has remained vacant as various proposals to redevelop it have failed, including one which turned into a flashpoint over living wage policies and ended in a rare defeat for the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2013, a new plan to redevelop it as the world's largest indoor ice center was announced, called the Kingsbridge National Ice Center. One National Guard unit has continued to use an annex in the rear until a new headquarters can be found.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 December 1958, {{the launch}} of Atlas 10B sent the missile into orbit around the Earth (without use of an upper stage) {{carrying}} the [...] "SCORE" [...] (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment) communications payload. Atlas 10B/SCORE, at 8750 lb was the heaviest man-made object then in orbit, the first voice relay satellite, and the first man-made object in space easily {{visible to the naked}} eye due to the large, mirror-polished stainless steel tank. This was the first flight in what would be a long career for the Atlas as a satellite launcher. Many retired Atlas ICBMs would be used as launch vehicles, most with an added spin-stabilized solid rocket motor upper stage for polar orbit military payloads. Even before its <b>military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended</b> in 1965, Atlas had placed four Project Mercury astronauts in orbit and was becoming the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles, most notably Atlas Agena and Atlas Centaur.|$|R

50|$|The area {{consists}} of reclaimed sea bed, {{with a number}} of former islets making up small isolated hills; it was dammed and drained during the 1940s to serve as an artillery training range. After active <b>military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended</b> in 1983, some of the area has been used for transportation infrastructure (motorway and railway in connection with the Øresund bridge), a landfill on the stip between the motorway and the ocean dyke, a golf course and {{the southern end of the}} Ørestad urban development. Most of the area, however, lies as lightly maintained parkland featuring a range of nature types, from young forests to tidal marshes; some areas are prevented from developing into forests by grazing livestock and game. After years of preparation the area was finally cleared of unexploded munitions and fully opened to the general public on October 15, 2010. Previously, because of the risk of unexploded munitions, walking outside the paths and roads was generally not allowed. A large area in the southwestern corner is set aside under the Natura 2000-scheme as an EU-recognized bird protection area to which the general public has no access.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1880s a naval mine {{facility}} was built, adjacent {{west of the}} fort {{with access to the}} foreshore for the Humber Division Submarine Miners. The facilities included a 376 ft pier, and a light railway to carry the mines to the piers. The Paull Point battery was also upgraded during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century, receiving two and four 9.2 and 6 in breech loading guns, as well as four muzzle loaders - the breech loaders which were placed in new concrete emplacements (1894). Electric defence searchlights were installed in 1907. In the early part of the 20th century and First World War the role of the fort was reduced due to the construction of new emplacements nearer to the mouth of the Humber, at Sunk Island and Stallingborough, better able to protect the port of Immingham. During the First World War additional forts and gun emplacements were built at Spurn Point, Kilnsea, Bull Sand Fort and Haile Sand Fort, reducing Paull Point's military importance; however the site wa retained as the headquarters for the defence of the Humber. During the Second World War the fort was the site of a ship Degaussing station, as well as being used as an ammunition store. <b>Military</b> <b>use</b> <b>ended</b> in 1956, and the site was sold in 1960/1.|$|R
