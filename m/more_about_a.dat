It is a collective {{work of the}} field guides Secrets of the Clans and Code of the Clans, although four pages of color artwork and the double foldout map inserts {{in the middle of}} Secrets of the Clans, as well as five pieces of color artwork in Code of the Clans, are not included in Enter the Clans. The Ulitimate Guide features a large page or <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> cat that was important in the series, and a detailed painted illustration to go with it.

25|$|Ishida Hitoshi {{makes the}} case that the image of the bishōnen is <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{grounding}} in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 60's, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead resumed {{recording}} in September 1996 at St Catherine's Court, {{a historic}} mansion near Bath owned by actress Jane Seymour. The mansion was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition {{in the recording}} process. Greenwood, comparing the mansion to previous studio settings, said it [...] "was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> group of people making their first record together." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E

[...] The [...] "grunge credo was <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> death by slow suffocation", a [...] "resistance through withdrawal" [...] from the world. Rupa Huq calls grunge [...] "unrelentingly white" [...] in [...] "timbre and texture". Robert Loss states that while the grunge scene was more welcoming to women than the glam metal world, and while grunge [...] "...endeavoured to be more accepting of ethnic and cultural difference, it was overwhelmingly white"; he states that hip hop music artists such as Jay-Z had way more [...] "crossover" [...] appeal to listeners of different races.|$|E

500|$|The guitar-driven [...] "Quiero" [...] ("I Want") {{explains}} Shakira's happiness {{upon the}} return of a lover. Similarly, the mid-tempo [...] "Te Necesito" [...] ("I Need You") and the upbeat [...] "Vuelve" [...] ("Return") describe her yearning for a romantic partner to re-enter her life. [...] "Te Espero Sentada" [...] ("I Wait Sitting") expresses a desire for a romantic partner {{to be aware of}} the sorrow his absence brings to Shakira. [...] "Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos" [...] ("Bare Feet, White Dreams") suggests that one is happiest when living a carefree lifestyle, while [...] "Pienso en Ti" [...] ("I Think of You") notes that Shakira thinks <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> lover as times progresses. The penultimate track [...] "¿Dónde Estás Corazón?" [...] ("Where Are You Love?") asks that her boyfriend comes back to her. The album closes with its eleventh track [...] "Se Quiere, Se Mata" [...] ("You Like, You Kill"), which tells the story of expectant parents Braulio and Dana, and sees the usage of a harmonica during its chorus.|$|E
500|$|That evening Harry sees a Patronus in {{the form}} of a doe, which leads him to a frozen pond. Gryffindor's sword lies beneath the pond's ice, which Harry breaks and jumps in to {{retrieve}} it. The locket around his neck attempts to strangle him, but Ron arrives just in time to rescue Harry. Harry uses parseltongue to open the locket, and Ron destroys the Horcrux with the sword. Hermione and Ron reconcile, and the trio decide to go and visit Xenophilius Lovegood to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> symbol drawn in the book Dumbledore left Hermione. Lovegood explains to them that the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows, three magical objects that when combined make a wizard master of Death. Hermione reads the story of the Hallows from her book, and after some awkward conversation the trio try to leave but are stopped by Lovegood. He explains that Luna has been kidnapped before betraying them and summoning the Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione disapparate as Lovegood's house is destroyed.|$|E
500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points. After a few minutes, the Warriors led 19–3, and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the Knicks trailed 42–26, and in his typical style, Chamberlain had already scored 23 points, making all nine of his free throws. Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making barely more than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was thinking <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, he snapped at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained. During halftime, the Warriors' Guy Rodgers said, [...] "Let's get the ball to Dip. Let's see how many he can get." [...] McGuire agreed.|$|E

2500|$|Washington rotated some 60° or <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> pivot {{somewhere in}} the Olympic Peninsula (see Oregon rotation, below). This would have left a large gap south of the OWL, which could explain why Cenozoic rocks are not found {{immediately}} south of the OWL.

2500|$|Scholz {{notes the}} {{linguistic}} {{ambiguity of the}} passage and the variety of interpretations that stem from it. She wrote that [...] "since this narrative is not a 'historical' or 'accurate' report about actual events, {{the answers to these}} questions reveal <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> reader's assumptions regarding gender, androcentrism, and sociopolitical practices than can be known about ancient Israelite life based on Judges 19. [...] Predictably, interpreters deal differently with the meaning of the story, depending on their hermeneutical interests." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 19th century, {{the state}} became far more centralized, {{and the history}} far more precise. Expansion continued, {{reaching}} the shores of Lake Kivu. [...] This expansion was less about military conquest and <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> migrating population spreading Rwandan agricultural techniques, social organization, and {{the extension of the}} political control of a Mwami. Once this was established camps of warriors were established along the vulnerable borders to prevent incursions. Only against other well developed states such as Gisaka, Bugesera, and Burundi was expansion carried out primarily by force of arms.|$|E
5000|$|Living history {{approach}} to gain authenticity is less <b>about</b> replaying <b>a</b> certain event {{according to a}} planned script as in other reenactment fields.

Researching the lives of an ancestor's cluster leads to a more complete and more accurate picture of the ancestor's life.|$|R

2500|$|Noting that [...] "this time it's much <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> deconstructed, looser {{version of}} English Country Garden style", London Lite {{recalled}} the early 1970s designs of Laura Ashley – [...] "all folds of floral cotton and centre partings". Actresses Mischa Barton and Milla Jovovich were cited as exponents of this look, while Jade Jagger (daughter of Sir Mick Jagger, of the Rolling Stones, and Bianca Jagger) {{was said to}} be promoting her own style of [...] "Balearic boho" [...] on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza, a long-time haven for beatniks and hippies who colonised the village of Sant Carles in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Another primary {{disagreement}} with Freud stemmed from their differing {{concepts of the}} unconscious. Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung's observations overlap to an extent with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the [...] "personal unconscious", but his hypothesis is <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> process than a static model and he also proposed {{the existence of a}} second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid – a term borrowed from Driesch, but with a somewhat altered meaning. The collective unconscious, {{is not so much a}} 'geographical location', but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of archetypes over space and time. Freud had actually mentioned a collective level of psychic functioning but saw it primarily as an appendix to the rest of the psyche.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{as a boy}} Samuel {{displayed}} rare ability (Yer. Ketuvim v. 30a; Yer. Peah viii. 21b). His first {{teacher was}} an otherwise unknown man, and Samuel, who knew <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> certain legal question than did his teacher, would not submit to ill treatment by him (Ḥul. 107b). Then Samuel's father, who was himself a prominent teacher of the Law, recognized as such even by Rab (Abba Arika; Ket. 51b), undertook to instruct the boy. As {{he seems to have}} been unequal to this task he sent him to Nisibis to attend the school of the rabbi who had predicted the boy's birth, that he might there acquire a knowledge of the Law ("Tanya," [...] Hilkot [...] "Abel," [...] ed. Horowitz, p.137, quoted from Yer.; comp. also Mordecai on M. Ḳ. 889). Samuel seems to have remained only a short time at Nisibis. On his return to Nehardea he studied under Levi b. Sisi, who was in Babylon before the death of Judah ha-Nasi (see A. Krochmal in [...] "He-Ḥaluẓ," [...] i. 69), and who exerted a great influence on Samuel's development. Samuel made such rapid progress and became so proficient in his studies that he soon associated as an equal with his teacher (Hoffmann, [...] "Mar Samuel," [...] p.70).|$|E
