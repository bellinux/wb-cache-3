40|$|The authors compare {{frequency}} {{doubling of}} broadband {{light in a}} single nonlinear crystal with doubling in five crystals with intercrystal temporal walk off compensation, and with doubling in five crystals adjusted for offset phase <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Using a plane-wave, dispersive numerical model of frequency doubling they study the bandwidth of the second harmonic and the conversion efficiency as functions of crystal length and fundamental irradiance. For low irradiance the offset phase matching arrangement has lower efficiency than a single crystal of the same total length but gives a broader second harmonic bandwidth. The walk off compensated arrangement gives both higher conversion efficiency and broader bandwidth than a single crystal. At high irradiance, both multicrystal arrangements improve on the single crystal efficiency while maintaining broad bandwidth...|$|E
30|$|The overall {{performance}} of the models {{was measured by the}} combined <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This can be done by dividing the frequency of the total matching (deficit, excess and normal) rainfall to the total model values. For instance the frequency of the total matching rainfall of the model bccr was (deficit =  0, excess =  1 and normal =  9). The combined POD was calculated by dividing the sum of the frequency of deficit, excess and normal rainfall years by the total model years (10 / 20). Accordingly, the best performed model from the overall analysis of POD calculations was the model cccma (70  %) (Tables  4, 8). In general, we have concluded that from the period 1971 to 1990, the model cccma captured relatively similar rainfall recorded vales as compared to the observed one.|$|E

Body odor is also thought to be used during mate choice to select genetically compatible mates. The idea that body odor reveals information about both genetic identity and genetic similarity is most readily tested by examining odor in twin pairs. However, although this idea {{can be traced back}} 130 years to Francis Galton in 1875, most studies using dogs fail to control for shared environmental effects associated with cohabitation. Here we show that odors of identical twins (but not dizygotic twins) can be matched by human sniffers at rates better than chance, even when the twins are living apart. In addition, <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies</b> for identical twin odors were not significantly different from those for duplicate odors from the same individual. These results indicate an important genetic influence on body odor and the potential for developing technologies for human odor printing in relation to underlying genotype...|$|E

40|$|Interactions {{of voice}} source and vocal tract {{resonances}} {{are of particular}} interest with respect to register transitions and bioacoustics. There is experimental evidence that singing into a tube generates nonlinear phenomena around <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the pitch and the. rst formant. In the present study, we analyze a simpli. ed two-mass model coupled to a straight tube. The essential parameters of the systems are varied systematically to localize instability regions in parameter space. The resulting bifurcation diagrams reveal subharmonic vibrations and deterministic chaos if the pitch and the. rst formant coincide. The computer simulations closely resemble published experimental observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the role of coupling strength {{as the cause of}} instability. Small tube cross sectional areas and overcritical pressures are responsible for additional instability regions around second pitch harmonic and formant resonance. The results indicate that under certain circumstances source-tract interactions induce quite complex voice instabilities, even for symmetric vocal folds. These include frequency jumps, subharmonic regimes and chaos. The possible relevance for the soprano whistle voice and animal vocalization is discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Predicting thermo-acoustic instabilities in {{combustion}} chambers remains an important issue. These instabilities mainly contain hydrodynamic and acoustic waves {{and can lead}} to severe structural damage if the energy feedback due to combustion builds up high amplitudes. In order to predict their behavior, linearized flow solvers have been developed in combination with an Arnoldi extraction method to compute several of the least damped eigenmodes of combustor flows. This technique has been validated against an atmospheric combustor test rig, named Validation Rig I, in which both low frequency buzz and high frequency screech modes could be induced. Both types of modes have also been found computationally, by <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies</b> and modes shapes. A post-processing mode stability analysis procedure has also been developed with which any computed eigenmode may be analyzed with respect to the Rayleigh criterion. The results of the mode stability analysis are consistent with the corresponding unsteady RANS simulations, but not with the experimental data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} efficiently forming reduced-order models for large, linear dynamic systems. Projections onto unions of Krylov subspaces {{lead to a}} class of reducedorder models known as rational interpolants. The cornerstone of this dissertation {{is a collection of}} theory relating Krylov projection to rational interpolation. Based on this theoretical framework, three algorithms for model reduction are proposed. The first algorithm, dual rational Arnoldi, is a numerically reliable approach involving orthogonal projection matrices. The second, rational Lanczos, is an efficient generalization of existing Lanczos-based methods. The third, rational power Krylov, avoids orthogonalization and is suited for parallel or approximate computations. The performance of the three algorithms is compared via a combination of theory and examples. Independent of the precise algorithm, a host of supporting tools are also developed to form a complete model-reduction package. Techniques for choosing the <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies,</b> estimating the modeling error, insuring the model's stability, treating multiple-input multiple-output systems, implementing parallelism, and avoiding a need for exact factors of large matrix pencils are all examined to various degrees...|$|E

The {{objective of}} this study was to determine how well the Unified Medical Language System, the largest repository of concepts and terms in biomedicine, represents dental concepts. Method and materials: The dental subset of concepts was extracted from Unified Medical Language System using the software program APEX (APplication for the EXtraction of domain-specific concepts). The relationships contained in the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus were used to locate the concepts related to 12 seed terms. The Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale (513 dental terms) and the Diagnostic Codes developed by Leake et al (124 terms) were compared to the dental subset. Terms were classified as exact match, related term, or no match. The resultant matching characteristics were compared to those determined by the National Library of Medicine/Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Large Scale Vocabulary Test. Results: The dental subset of Unified Medical Language System contained 948 concepts. The Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale and the Diagnostic Codes exhibited similar matching characteristics for exact match (61. 6 % and 58. 9 %, respectively) and related term (38. 0 % and 32. 2 %, respectively).

40|$|One-dimensional seismic ground {{response}} analyses are often performed using equivalent-linear procedures, which require few, generally well-known parameters. Nonlinear analyses {{have the potential}} to more accurately simulate soil behavior, but their implementation in practice has been limited because of poorly documented and unclear parameter selection and code usage protocols as well as inadequate documentation of the benefits of nonlinear modeling relative to equivalent linear modeling. Regarding code usage/parameter selection protocols, the following are described: (1) when input motions are from ground surface recordings, we show that the full outcropping motion should be used without converting to a “within” condition; (2) Rayleigh damping should be specified using at least two <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies</b> with a target level equal to the small strain soil damping; (3) the “target” soil backbone curves used in analysis can be parameterized to capture either the soil’s dynamic shear strength when large-strain soil response is expected (strains approaching 1 %), relatively small-strain response (i. e., < 0. 3 %) as inferred from cyclic laboratory tests, or a hybrid of the two; (4) models used in nonlinear codes inevitably represent a compromise between the optimal fitting of the shapes of backbone and hysteretic damping curves, and we present two alternatives for model parameterization. The parameter selection and code usage protocols are tested by comparing predictions to data from vertical arrays. We find site amplification to be generally underpredicted at high frequencies and overpredicted at the elastic site period, where a strong local resonance occurs that is not seen in the data.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the smooth pursuit reflex {{and the ability to}} suppress the vestibulo-ocular reflex were assessed in 10 normal subjects and in patients with a variety of diseases of the central nervous system. Pursuit was measured as the maximum velocity of slow phase eye movement in response to a laser target moving sinusoidally at various frequencies up to 1 Hz and with amplitudes stepped up to 35 ° peak. Suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex was assessed with subjects seated in a Barany chair rotating sinusoidally in yaw at <b>matching</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The breakpoint of vestibulo-ocular reflex supression was defined as the peak velocity of oscillation at which nystagmus appeared on electro-oculographic recording as determined by the method of ascending and descending thresholds. For normal subjects, at all frequencies, the breakpoint of suppression corresponded closely with the peak velocity of pursuit at the corresponding frequency of target oscillation. In some patients pursuit and suppression were comparably impaired. In others either pursuit or suppression could be selectively impaired with the other function left intact. The results demonstrate that the mechanisms of pursuit and visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex have similar dynamics and share a common pathway at least {{to the level of the}} cerebellum. Thereafter, there is presumably an anatomical and functional dissociation of the signals mediating the two functions. The key area involved appears to be the flocculus for lesions of this structure alone cause impairment of both functions. The findings also indicate that the appropriate way to test smooth pursuit in relationship to suppression is to increase the amplitude of target oscillation until the peak slow eye movement velocity is determined for each frequency. The finding that increasing excursion increases maximum pursuit velocity supports the view that pursuit has an acceleration limit which is more critical in determining performance than velocity limitations. The results establish the assessment of vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression as a powerful test of the integrity of CNS function independent of its previous association with disordered pursuit...|$|E

Here we show <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> in Culex quinquefasciatus, where the wing-beat frequencies {{of males and females}} differ considerably. The wing-beat frequencies converge not on the fundamental but on the nearest shared harmonic (usually female's third and male's second). Frequencies in this range are, however, too high to elicit phasic sensory-neural responses [2, 3] from the Johnston's organ (JO) or to drive the mosquito's motor neurons. Potential cues for <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> are difference tones produced by nonlinear mixing of male and female flight tones in the vibrations of the mosquito's antennae. Receptor potentials and neural-motor activity were recorded in response to difference tones produced when a mosquito was stimulated simultaneously by two tones at frequencies outside the phasic response range of the JO but within range of the antennal vibrations. We demonstrate sexual recognition through matching of flight-tone harmonics in Culex mosquitoes and suggest that difference tones are used as an error signal for <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> beyond the <b>frequency</b> range of the JO's sensory-neural range.
