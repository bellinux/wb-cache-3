5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> fans to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E

5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis {{has been placed on}} St George's Cross {{at the expense of the}} traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that there are factors other than true attentional {{abilities}} that might relate to difficulty paying attention. For example, it is possible that sensory deficits impact older adults' attentional abilities. In other words, impaired hearing or vision may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> older adults to do well on tasks of visual and verbal attention.|$|E

Trains on the Kelana Jaya LRT line coming into the city from Kelana Jaya, which normally stop at Pasar Seni and Masjid Jamek, instead bypassed those stations, going from KL Sentral directly to Dang Wangi Station. Passengers were not given any warning of this and many did not realise they {{would not be able to}} stop at these stations until the train was already on its way to Dang Wangi or Sentral.|$|E

Unlike other groups, for example, the dissident Action Group on Human Rights in the USSR, previous editors of the Chronicle had never openly linked their names to the samizdat text.

25|$|The next {{election}} in 1996 saw Labor regain three seats and the Greens lose one. Ray Groom, who had promised {{before the election}} to only govern with a majority, resigned and handed the leadership to Tony Rundle, who formed a loose alliance with the Greens to govern in a minority until 1998, when the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly (from 35 to 25 seats) in an (ultimately, unsuccessful) attempt to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> minor parties to be elected. Rundle immediately called an election, which Labor won comfortably, leaving the Greens with only one seat.|$|E

25|$|Sumner had {{returned}} to England after the tests, and European miners brought in by Heatly were ravaged by disease. Furthermore, Heatly was posted far away to Purnia, making personal supervision impossible, and from 1781 the East India Company began to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> its employees to conduct private ventures of this nature. These were all additional issues, {{on top of the}} loss of the East India Company as a potentially large purchaser, and the venture petered out. It was not until around 1814–1815 that the first coal pit was sunk for the purpose of extraction in India.|$|E
25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.|$|E
25|$|Responding to the {{popularity}} of Pritchard's and other exposures of masonic ritual, Grand Lodge, about this time, made changes to ritual and passwords to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> outsiders to pass themselves off as masons. These changes were not universally accepted by affiliated lodges. The Goose and Gridiron (now Lodge of Antiquity No. 2), {{one of the original}} and most senior lodges of the constitution, never adopted them. For the unaffiliated, the innovations simply deepened the division. At the time, London was absorbing many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already Freemasons felt that they could not work with the new ritual, and the lodges they formed swelled further the numbers of unaffiliated lodges in the capital.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the case of}} UK stamp duty reserve tax shows that {{provided}} exemptions are given to market makers and banks, that FTT can generate modest revenues, {{at the expense of}} pensioners and savers. Despite the low tax rate of 0.5% on the purchase of shares, the UK managed to generate between €3.7 and €7.4 billion in revenues from stamp duties per year throughout the last decade. Also the cases of Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland suggest that countries may generate sizable amounts of income by introducing FTT on a national scale. If implemented on an international scale, revenues may be even considerably higher, since it would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> traders to avoid the tax by moving to other locations.|$|E
25|$|A rootkit can modify data {{structures}} in the Windows kernel using a method known as direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM). This method {{can be used to}} hide processes. A kernel mode rootkit can also hook the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), or modify the gates between user mode and kernel mode, in order to cloak itself. Similarly for the Linux operating system, a rootkit can modify the system call table to subvert kernel functionality. It's common that a rootkit creates a hidden, encrypted filesystem in which it can hide other malware or original copies of files it has infected. Operating systems are evolving to counter the threat of kernel-mode rootkits. For example, 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows now implement mandatory signing of all kernel-level drivers in order to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> untrusted code to execute with the highest privileges in a system.|$|E
25|$|The Maoz {{released}} its five boats at 21:10, and by 22:00, the boats were {{in close proximity}} to the Egyptian vessels. Two of the boats, manned by Ya'akov Vardi and Zalman Abramov, were intended for the actual sabotage, one as a reserve, manned by the commander Yohai Bin-Nun, and one to collect the commandos after the operation, manned by Yitzhak Brockman and Ya'akov Reitov. The Israeli sailors used helmets with infrared lights to ease the extraction process. The Egyptian ships, believing that a ceasefire was already in effect, had their lights on and were easy to spot. Despite this, according to a later Israeli estimate, they had been on full alert. Because the Egyptian ships were facing one another, Bin-Nun decided that Abramov and Vardi would attack the bows of the Emir Farouk and the minesweeper, respectively. This would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Egyptians to fire at the boats should they have spotted them, because they could hit each other.|$|E
