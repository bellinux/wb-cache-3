5|$|Congenital <b>malformation</b> or {{underdevelopment}} (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari <b>malformation.</b>|$|E

Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Glomuvenous <b>malformations,</b> {{also known}} as glomangiomas, are tumor-like <b>malformations</b> or hamartomas of the glomus body. They can be {{sporadic}} or inherited as an autosomal dominant disease. Glomuvenous <b>malformations</b> tend to resemble hemangiomas. Clinical distinction between these entities is important due to their different therapeutic approaches. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for isolated, painful glomuvenous <b>malformations.</b> We describe {{a case of a}} 7 -year-old girl with multiple glomuvenous <b>malformations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{relative}} importance of congenital <b>malformations</b> {{as a cause of}} death {{in the first year of}} life is increasing along with the control of preventable causes of perinatal mortality. Aim: To identify risk factors for congenital <b>malformations.</b> Patients and Methods: Retrospective case-control study of births registered in the database of The Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital <b>Malformations</b> (ECLAMC), in the period 2001 - 2010. Results: Birth weight and gestational age were significantly lower in cases than controls, behaving as risk factors and associated with a greater severity of congenital <b>malformations.</b> The risk and severity of congenital <b>malformations</b> increased along with mother&# 8217;s age. Fetal growth retardation, a history of congenital <b>malformations</b> in the family, physical factors and acute illnesses of the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy were also significant risk factors for congenital <b>malformations</b> and their severity. The educational level of the mother was a protective factor for congenital <b>malformations</b> and their severity. Conclusions: Variables previously identified as risk factors for congenital <b>malformations,</b> were significantly related with the occurrence of congenital <b>malformations</b> and their severity...|$|R

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and <b>malformation</b> of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

40|$|Classification and {{diagnosis}} of ear <b>malformations</b> In the ENT region 50 % of the <b>malformations</b> affect the ear. <b>Malformations</b> {{of the outer}} and middle ear are predominantly unilateral (ca. 70 - 90 %) and mostly involve the right ear. Inner ear <b>malformations</b> can be unilateral or bilateral. The incidence of ear <b>malformations</b> is approximately 1 in 3800 newborns. Ear <b>malformations</b> may be genetic (associated with syndromes or not, with family history, spontaneous mutations) or acquired in nature. <b>Malformations</b> can affect the outer ear (pinna and external auditory canal, EAC), middle ear and inner ear, not infrequently in combination. Formal classification is advisable {{in order to be}} able to predict the prognosis and compare treatment schedules. Various classifications have been proposed: pinna and EAC <b>malformations</b> according to Weerda [1], middle ear <b>malformations</b> according to Kösling [2], and inner ear <b>malformations</b> according to Jackler [3], [4], to Marangos [5] and to Sennaroglu [6].

5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari <b>malformation.</b> Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial <b>Malformation</b> (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed.

This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E
5|$|The BRCA2 helical domain {{adopts a}} helical structure, {{consisting}} of a four-helix cluster core (alpha 1, alpha 8, alpha 9, alpha 10) and two successive beta-hairpins (beta 1 to beta 4).

40|$|Background & objectives: Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of <b>malformations</b> {{is an important}} method of prevention and control of congenital anomalies with poor prognosis. Central nervous system (CNS) <b>malformations</b> amongst {{these are the most}} common. The information about the prevalence and spectrum of prenatally detected <b>malformations</b> is crucial for genetic counselling and policymaking for population-based preventive programmes. The objective {{of this study was to}} study the spectrum of prenatally detected CNS <b>malformations</b> and their association with chromosomal abnormalities and autopsy findings. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in north India from January 2007 to December 2013. The details of cases with prenatally detected CNS <b>malformations</b> were collected and were related with the foetal chromosomal analysis and autopsy findings. Results: Amongst 6044 prenatal ultrasonographic examinations performed; 768 (12. 7 %) had structural <b>malformations</b> and 243 (31. 6 %) had CNS <b>malformations.</b> Neural tube defects (NTDs) accounted for 52. 3 per cent of CNS <b>malformations</b> and 16. 5 per cent of all <b>malformations.</b> The other major groups of prenatally detected CNS <b>malformations</b> were ventriculomegaly and midline anomalies. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 8. 2 per cent of the 73 cases studied. Foetal autopsy findings were available for 48 foetuses. Foetal autopsy identified additional findings in eight foetuses and the aetiological diagnosis changed in two of them (4. 2 %). Interpretation & conclusions: Amongst prenatally detected <b>malformations,</b> CNS <b>malformations</b> were common. NTD, which largely is a preventable anomaly, continued to be the most common group. Moreover, 60 per cent of <b>malformations</b> were diagnosed after 20 weeks, posing legal issues. Chromosomal analysis and foetal autopsy are essential for genetic counselling based on aetiological diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and <b>malformation</b> of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
