25|$|Left-hand bits {{are almost}} always twist bits and are {{predominantly}} used in the repetition engineering industry on screw machines or drilling heads. Left-handed drill bits allow a <b>machining</b> <b>operation</b> to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or {{the design of the}} machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a <b>machining</b> <b>operation</b> depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E

Results show no effect of double <b>machine</b> <b>operation</b> on strain where responsibility was low.

2500|$|Modern {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used the work piece stops rotating and the driven tool executes the <b>machining</b> <b>operation</b> with a rotating cutting tool.

50|$|In {{almost every}} kind of <b>machining</b> <b>operation,</b> either the work piece or the cutting tool turns. If enough {{flexibility}} {{is built into the}} parts of a machine tool involved in these functions, the resulting machine can do almost {{every kind of}} <b>machining</b> <b>operation</b> that will physically fit on it. The multimachine starts with the concept of 3-in-1 machine tools—basically a combination of metal lathe, mill and drill press—but adds many other functions. It can be a 10-in-1 (or even more) machine tool.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to have a}} close view on <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> with {{industrial}} robots and thus to increase the machining accuracies when using industrial robots. This thesis represents a solution by continuously measuring the position errors of the robot during <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> in order to reach higher machining accuracies. With an additional 3 D piezo compensation mechanism those errors will be compensated during the <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> by using a closed-loop control.

30|$|Maintenance, {{repair and}} {{overhaul}} (MRO) activities {{are necessary to}} ensure safe and reliable <b>machine</b> <b>operation.</b> For many MRO processes, spare parts are essential, because their non-availability causes machine downtime. It is prolonged in case of long lead times that entail high operation costs. Hence, stock holding is necessary to achieve high service levels, allowing for short machine downtime. In contrast to high service levels and spare parts availability, inventory costs {{need to be considered}} to attain economic <b>machine</b> <b>operation.</b> There is a trade-off between service and inventory costs. The point of cost-optimal <b>machine</b> <b>operation</b> has to be determined.|$|R
50|$|A wiggler, edge-finder, or center-finder {{is a tool}} used in {{the spindle}} of a machine such as a mill.

50|$|One of the {{important}} aspects in manufacturing calculation is how to find and calculate the machining time in a <b>machining</b> <b>operation.</b> Generally, machining is family of processes or operations in which excess material is removed from a starting work piece by a sharp cutting tool so the remaining part has the desired geometry and the required shape. The most common machining operations can be classified into four types: turning, milling, drilling and lathe work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a feature-based {{representation}} model, a set {{of features}} {{can be used in}} both design representation and process planning to integrate design and manufacturing. Process planning activities such as generation of machining tool path, planning of <b>machining</b> <b>operations,</b> sequencing of <b>machining</b> <b>operations,</b> and selection of machining machines can be executed using a feature-based approach. In a typical process planning scheme, the <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> for producing a product are planned and arranged to be performed in a single manufacturing plant. However, in a multi-plant collaborative manufacturing environment in a global supply chain, a product can be designed and manufactured at different plants at multiple locations. In this research, a feature-based multi-plant process planning model is presented. A feature represents a machined volume that needs to be removed by certain <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> to produce a portion of the product. A set of sequenced features represents a machining sequence for producing the part. A mathemati cal model is formulated to evaluate all the feasible machining sequences. The objective attempts to find the optimized multi-plant machining sequence with an aim of the minimizing the total manufacturing operation cost. As a result, the multiple machining sequences can be evaluated and the <b>machining</b> <b>operations</b> are assigned to the most suitable plants in a multi-plant collaborative manufacturing system...|$|R

50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a <b>machining</b> <b>operation,</b> or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|A {{tool bit}} is a non-rotary cutting tool used in metal lathes, shapers, and planers. Such cutters are also often {{referred}} to by the set-phrase name of single-point cutting tool, as distinguished from other cutting tools such as a saw or water jet cutter. The cutting edge is ground to suit a particular <b>machining</b> <b>operation</b> and may be resharpened or reshaped as needed.
