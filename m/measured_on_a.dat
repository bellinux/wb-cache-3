5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2the main creek just {{above and below the}} entry of Muddy Run, respectivelyand T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa richness, as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (<b>measured</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck’s Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E

25|$|The {{temperature}} range in which creep deformation may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a {{temperature in the}} thousands of degrees before creep deformation can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0°C (32°F). As a general guideline, the effects of creep deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point (as <b>measured</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> thermodynamic temperature scale such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 45% of melting point for ceramics. Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the creep minimum temperature {{is related to the}} melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice.|$|E
