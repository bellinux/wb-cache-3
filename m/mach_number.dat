5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 b, {{multiple}} {{peaks of the}} <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> occur along the center axis of the beam. In the region between the entrance and throat of the Laval nozzle, the <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> increase gradually which have a weak dependence on the throat size.

At a throat size of 1.2  mm, the first peak of <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> reaches a maximum value of 2.569. It {{can be seen that}} the peaks of the <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> shift toward the chamber with the increases of the Laval nozzle throat diameters.

25|$|The local {{speed of}} sound, {{and thereby the}} <b>Mach</b> <b>number,</b> depends on the {{condition}} of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature. The <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an incompressible flow. The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a nozzle, diffusers or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number.

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of aerodynamics, a flow is {{considered}} to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower.
