40|$|Today's social {{awareness}} {{of environmental protection}} presents the electronic companies with an irreversible trend towards green manufacturing. It raises harsh requirement for the sourcing process and imposes unprecedented pressure to the QA system, majorly due {{to the risk of}} hazardous material. As QA procedures are becoming more complicated for coping with increasing <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> and meanwhile the time and resource available are tightly constrained, the development of an effective mechanism for material testing turns up to be a critical issue. In this study, a hierarchical <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> assessment approach is proposed based on FMEA framework. Taking into account the risk occurrence, the difficulty in detection and the severity the risk causes, it enables companies to estimate their material risks dynamically using Bayesian network. With its help, companies can assess and prioritize the <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> in a systematic and efficient manner which will drive QA towards a more high-performance process. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM 2010), Macao, China, 7 - 10 December 2010.

40|$|The {{hazardous}} <b>materials</b> <b>risk</b> management process {{involves a}} set of crucial logistical decisions referring to the planning of the hazardous materials transportation {{and the organization of}} the emergency response operations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a Decision Support System for hazardous <b>Materials</b> Transportation <b>Risk</b> Management that covers integrated hazardous materials distribution and emergency response decisions. The inherent interrelationships between the emerging hazardous materials logistical problems imply the integration of routing and emergency response logistical decisions in order to improve the effectiveness of the hazardous materials emergency response process. The proposed system contributes substantially to this objective by providing the following capabilities: (i) provision of alternative efficient hazardous materials distribution routes in terms of minimum cost and risk, (ii) identification of the emergency response units locations that minimise the incident response time and secure a predefined service level for hazardous materials incidents, (iii) routing of the emergency response units, and (iv) identification of optimum evacuation plans i. e. optimum evacuation paths and traffic assignment given the evacuation area. The focus of this paper is on the exposition of the proposed Decision Support System components and capabilities while special emphasis is placed on the contribution of this system to the hazardous <b>materials</b> <b>risk</b> management process. The proposed system has been implemented, used and evaluated for the hazardous materials management within the area of Thriasion Pedion of Attica, Greece...|$|R
