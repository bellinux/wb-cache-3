50|$|The fine-thread screws show a {{slip and}} stick behaviour; when used manually, a torque is applied with two fingers until the thread slips a bit, then the new {{position}} is read on a scale. Inexpensive screws do long slips and lack a scale. Precision micrometers perform better {{and provide a}} scale for reference. When used remotely, an electric motor is used to apply short pulses of torque. The motor is firmly connected with the screw and the thread and nothing else so that the pulse is absorbed by friction. To read out the position electronically, a rotary encoder is attached. When the ball is not completely centered on the screw and the axis is not normal to the mirror surface (which is an explicit feature of some convenience mirror mounts), a small sinus movement of the mirror is overlaid onto the linear movement, which a controller could compensate for.

50|$|Early surveys (beginning {{in the mid}} 20th century) {{often used}} the Wenner array, which was a linear array of four probes.

A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> to collect survey readings, and the other current probe placed remotely along with a voltage reference probe.

40|$|International audienceSpace {{and time}} {{concepts}} cannot be defined independently of each other; thus, {{there is a}} mathematical link between the corresponding parameters describing our physical world. An expression of this link is met in that, to-day, assessments {{of space and time}} standards are both derived from one single phenomenon, light movement, whose velocity is decided at an arbitrary mathematical value. A way to describe the space-time-associated reality is done by means of a phase-space frame where the position of the entities are represented with respect to eachother without the need of a special time parameter. The “extraction” of a single time parameter from this frame is done by favoring, among all the physical entities, one that is assumed to be moving by itself (e. g. the photon), the position of which defines the time. Because time is related to position, one may give a pre-temporal significance to a three-dimensional spatial parameter. Three-dimensional pre-time, to which is associated three-dimensional space parameter through a tensorial duality, allows a straightforward expression of the consequences of space-time duality, particularly for frame transformations, with space and time parameters on an equal footing. If one wants to have a suitable connection between the physical descriptions of phenomena both in a <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> and in a rest one, the same ratio of space to time standards must be taken in both frames. As a result, effects similar to Lorentz transformation are obtained; they may be understood as picturing a non-Euclidean metrics for the <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> as represented in the rest frame. They may also be conceived as uncertainty relations connecting the values of time and space standards to that of light velocity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND, AIMS AND DESIGN: The {{increase}} in mobile telephone-only households {{may be a}} source of bias for traditional landline gambling prevalence surveys. Aims were to: (1) identify Australian gambling participation and problem gambling prevalence using a dual-frame (50 % landline and 50 % mobile telephone) computer-assisted telephone interviewing methodology; (2) explore the predictors of sample frame and telephone status; and (3) explore the degree to which sample frame and telephone status moderate the relationships between respondent characteristics and problem gambling. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2000 adult respondents residing in Australia were interviewed from March to April 2013. MEASUREMENTS: Participation in multiple gambling activities and Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). FINDINGS: Estimates were: gambling participation [63. 9 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  61. 4 - 66. 3], problem gambling (0. 4 %, 95 % CI =  0. 2 - 0. 8), moderate-risk gambling (1. 9 %, 95 % CI =  1. 3 - 2. 6) and low-risk gambling (3. 0 %, 95 % CI =  2. 2 - 4. 0). Relative to the landline frame, the <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> was more likely to gamble on horse/greyhound races [odds ratio (OR)  =  1. 4], casino table games (OR =  5. 0), sporting events (OR =  2. 2), private games (OR =  1. 9) and the internet (OR =  6. 5); less likely to gamble on lotteries (OR =  0. 6); and more likely to gamble on five or more activities (OR =  2. 4), display problem gambling (OR =  6. 4) and endorse PGSI items (OR =  2. 4 - 6. 1). Only casino table gambling (OR =  2. 9) and internet gambling (OR =  3. 5) independently predicted <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> membership. Telephone status (landline frame versus mobile dual users and mobile-only users) displayed similar findings. Finally, sample frame and/or telephone status moderated the relationship between gender, relationship status, health and problem gambling (OR =  2. 9 - 7. 6). CONCLUSION: Given expected future increases in the mobile telephone-only population, best practice in population gambling research should use dual frame sampling methodologies (at least 50 % landline and 50 % mobile telephone) for telephone interviewing...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{intuitive}} motion editing technique allowing the end-user to transform an original motion by applying position constraints on freely selected {{locations of the}} character body. The major innovation comes from the possibility to assign a priority level to each constraint. The resulting scale of user-defined priority levels allows to handle multiple asynchronously overlapping constraints. As a consequence the end user can enforce a larger range of natural behaviors where conflicting constraints compete to control {{a common set of}} joints. By default the joint angles of the original motion are preserved as the lowest priority constraint. However, in case a Cartesian constraint from the original motion is essential, it is straightforward to define a high priority constraint that will retain it before enforcing other lower priority constraints. Additional features are proposed to provide a more productive motion editing process like defining the constraints relative to a <b>mobile</b> <b>frame</b> and precisely specifying which joints are recruited by each constrain.

The unit essentially provides a <b>mobile</b> <b>framing</b> construction {{system that can}} be used for construction of temporary, recyclable structures. These structures can be used for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and military contingency operations scenarios. CFSMF also provides benefits by reducing reliance on local economies’ resources in natural disaster affected areas and areas that have internally displaced or emigrating persons for various reasons. This project discusses the benefits and potential uses of CFSMF and recommends global locations to base these units. The 10 countries discussed in the case study have the highest need of such systems based on United Nations natural disaster data. The level of diplomatic relations of the 10 countries with theUnited States is gauged by the cumulative economic aid they received from theUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) over a 10 -year period. The recommended locations are determined by an integer programming optimization model. The model solution proposes an allocation method for CFSMF systems.

We show that the generalized Green-Dyson equation can be solved by linear algebra if one uses a representation of the rotations based on Wigner D-matrices.

40|$|Background: Although it was {{estimated}} that 20 % of the population in Australia were mobile-only phone users in 2010, the inclusion of mobile numbers into computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) behavioural risk factor surveys did not occur until 2012. Methods: Three papers have been published describing the methods, weighting strategy and the impact in detail of including mobile numbers into the NSW Population Health Survey (NSWPHS). This paper identifies the important components of those papers and summarises them for a broader audience. Results: In the 2012 NSWPHS, 15, 214 (15, 149 with weights) interviews were completed (64 % landline frame; 36 % <b>mobile</b> <b>frame).</b> Response, cooperation and contact rates were 37 %, 65 % and 69 % respectively. The inclusion of mobile phone numbers resulted in a sample that was closer to the NSW population profile and impacted on the time series of estimates for alcohol drinking, recommended fruit consumption, current smoking, and overweight or obesity. Conclusions: The papers found that including mobile phone numbers into NSWPHS did not impact negatively on response rates or data collection, but it did cost more and affect the time series for some behavioural risk factors, in that it corrected the estimates that had been produced from a sample frame that was progressively getting less representative of the population...|$|E
