5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{goldcrest}} taxa are {{found on the}} Atlantic islands of <b>Macaronesia.</b> Birds on the Canary Islands are ancient colonists, whereas those on The Azores are of more recent origin. There are no goldcrests on Madeira, where the Madeira firecrest is the only Regulus species.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy. It is considered native to southern and central continental Europe, {{as well as}} <b>Macaronesia</b> (the Azores and the Canary Islands), western Turkey, North Africa (Algeria), and western Asia (Iran). The fungus is rare in central Europe, and is listed in the Red data book of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The Harbour {{porpoise}}, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the Harbour porpoise {{is covered by}} the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and <b>Macaronesia.</b> Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in <b>Macaronesia</b> on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Patellifolia {{is mainly}} {{distributed}} in the Western Mediterranean region (Spain, Morocco), <b>Macaronesia</b> and Cape Verde Islands. There are also some isolated occurrences in North Africa (Hoggar Mountains and Tassili n'Ajjer, Libya), and in the Horn of Africa region (Socotra, Somalia).|$|E

25|$|Patellifolia is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} subfamily Betoideae of the plant family Amaranthaceae. These are mostly procumbent herbs occurring in the Western Mediterranean region and <b>Macaronesia,</b> with some isolated occurrences in North Africa and at the Horn of Africa. They are interesting as crop wild relatives of sugar beet.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{form the}} <b>Macaronesia</b> {{ecoregion}} with the Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira, and the Savage Isles. The Canary Islands {{is the largest}} and most populated archipelago of the <b>Macaronesia</b> region. The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin. The Teide volcano on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic oceanic crust associated {{with the opening of the}} Atlantic. Underwater magmatism commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the Miocene. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the Atlas Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division.|$|E
25|$|Scolymus is a genus of annual, {{biennial}} or perennial, herbaceous {{plants that}} {{is assigned to}} the Daisy family, {{and can be found}} in <b>Macaronesia,</b> around the Mediterranean, and in the Middle East. All species are spiny, thistle-like in appearance, with flowerheads that consist of yellow (rarely orange or white) ligulate florets, and canals that contain latex. It is known as سكوليمس (skwlyms) in Arab, scolyme in French, and is sometimes called golden thistle or oyster thistle in English.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cape Verde {{archipelago}} is geographically in Africa, {{there have}} been similar situations before. Cyprus is an island nation that, despite being geographically in Asia, has already joined both the Council of Europe and the EU. Furthermore, the Cape Verde islands {{are part of the}} same island group as the Canary Islands (part of Spain), Madeira Islands (part of Portugal) and Azores Islands (part of Portugal), known as <b>Macaronesia.</b> There is currently no political recognition by the EU of Cape Verde as a European state, but unlike in the case of Morocco, there is no formal rejection either.|$|E
25|$|Korf was Director Emeritus of the Cornell University Plant Pathology Herbarium (CUP), one of {{the largest}} fungal herbariums in the United States. Korf {{traveled}} globally {{over the course of his}} career, collecting fungi in Belgium, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, <b>Macaronesia,</b> New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Singapore, Sweden, and Taiwan. The Richard P. Korf Herbarium within CUP boasts nearly 5000 specimens, including 257 type specimens. This collection is dominated by taxa of particular interest to Korf: Arachnopeziza, Calycella (now Bisporella), Cheilymenia, Chlorosplenium, Dasyscyphus, Hyaloscypha, Hymenoscyphus, Mollisia, Orbiliaceae, Peziza, Rutstroemia, Scutellinia, and Trichophaea.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian Portuguese {{has had its}} own development, mostly {{similar to}} 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese (despite a very {{substantial}} number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese <b>Macaronesia),</b> with a few influences from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only. As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, {{partly because of the}} more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.|$|E
25|$|The islands' {{physical}} characteristics {{are the consequences}} of mountain-forming and volcanic forces that occurred between 60 and 70 million years ago, typical {{of many of the}} islands of <b>Macaronesia.</b> The islands were created during the late Miocene period, from a large submarine volcano and shaped by erosion and marine sedimentation. The larger islands and islet (Grande, Pequena and Fora, respectively) are the remnants of the peaks of these submarine mounts, and although located north of the Canaries, they were never connected to the African continent. The islands themselves are crossed by many calcareous faults, some marbleized, and made of basaltic rock, ash, and other volcanic materials. On many of the islands there are remnants of extinct cones, such as Atalaia (Selvagem Grande), Tornozelos and Veado. Other areas are sand covered from extensive aeolian, fluvial and marine erosion; headlands include Atalaia and Leste on Selvagem Grande, and Norte, Oeste, Leste and Garajaus on Selvagem Pequena.|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} has a {{huge range}} in Eurasia, breeding from <b>Macaronesia</b> to Japan. It is common in middle and northern temperate and boreal latitudes of Europe, between the [...] July isotherms, and thus predominantly in cooler climates than the firecrest. Further east it occurs discontinuously through southern Siberia to Sakhalin and Japan, in the Tian Shan mountains, northern Iran, and from the Himalayas east to central China.|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} (Regulus regulus) is a {{very small}} passerine bird in the kinglet family. Its colourful golden crest feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the [...] "king of the birds" [...] in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of Eurasia and the islands of <b>Macaronesia.</b> Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south.|$|E
500|$|A widely {{distributed}} species, Glutinoglossum glutinosum {{has been recorded}} from northern Africa (<b>Macaronesia</b> and Morocco), Asia (Bhutan, China, India, Japan, and the Philippines) and Europe. It is listed as vulnerable in Switzerland. In Bulgaria, where it is considered critically endangered, threats to G.glutinosum include [...] "habitat changes as result of agriculture activities (crops, livestock), atmospheric and land pollution, drought, global warming." [...] In a preliminary Regional Red List of Dutch macrofungi, G.glutinosum was considered threatened, and {{it was noted that}} before 1970, the fungus was [...] "rather common", compared to [...] "rather rare" [...] after that year. The North American distribution includes Canada, the United States, and Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Tired, weary, {{and lacking}} in money, the Carlins decided to remain in England to rest and recuperate. Throughout the journey from Nova Scotia to the Azores, both Carlin {{and his wife had}} {{suffered}} from severe hallucinations, including one instance where he had jerked awake to find himself 60° off course. Another important objective of their time in Britain was to repair Half-Safe, which had sustained large amounts of damage during the crossing, not least from Hurricane Charlie, which battered the vessel whilst it was amongst the islands of <b>Macaronesia.</b> The repairs to the craft were accomplished with the help of RAF Group Captain Malcolm Bunting, who had served alongside Carlin in India. To raise money for the continuation of the journey, Half-Safe was exhibited in department stores throughout Europe. During this time, Carlin also completed Half Safe: Across the Atlantic by Jeep, a book chronicling the first half of their journey, which sold 32,000 copies and was translated into five languages. The book was generally well received, with a reviewer in The Montreal Gazette describing Carlin as [...] "an adventurer of the old school – full of the explorer's instinct, and with a dry wit that makes his story an odd mixture of high-adventure and real understatement".|$|E
