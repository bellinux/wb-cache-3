500|$|Erythranthe is {{a highly}} diverse genus with the {{characteristics}} unifying the various species being axile placentation and long pedicels. Other characteristics of species can vary widely, especially between the sections, and even within some sections. Some species of Erythranthe are annuals, such as Erythranthe guttata, and some are perennials, such as Erythranthe nasuta. Flowers are red, pink, purple, or yellow, often in various combinations and shades of those colors. Some species produce copious amounts of aromatic compounds, giving them a musky odor (hence [...] "musk-flowers"). Erythranthe is used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the <b>mouse</b> <b>moth</b> (Amphipyra tragopoginis), as a main part of their diet.|$|E

40|$|Mast seeding, the {{intermittent}} {{production of}} large seed crops, can drive large fluctuations in abundance of granivores, and can have indirect effects that extend to a surprising array of species and ecological processes. Acorn masting has been hypothesized to indirectly control {{the initiation of}} gypsy moth outbreaks {{and the risk of}} Lyme disease, mediated by the direct effect of acorns on the abundance of white-footed mice. Through a combination of field experimentation, curve fitting to observational data, and modification of existing theory, I constructed mathematical models describing the masting phenomenon, and capturing its direct and indirect effects on gypsy moth populations and Lyme disease risk. I demonstrated synchronous masting by a suite of taxonomically diverse plants in New Zealand and used models to investigate the role of temperature as a synchronizing cue. I experimentally determined the type of functional response of white-footed <b>mice</b> to gypsy <b>moths,</b> and used monitoring data to parameterize a functional response model incorporating mouse space use. I then used this model, in conjunction with models simulating acorn masting the numerical response of mice, to explore the effect of acorns and <b>mice</b> on gypsy <b>moth</b> population dynamics. Finally, I modified epidemiological models to investigate the role of time-decaying reservoir competence and demographic turnover, of hosts like white-footed mice, on the ecology of Lyme disease. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{house mouse}} (Mus musculus) is a small, slender rodent {{that has a}} {{slightly}} pointed nose; small, black, somewhat protruding eyes; large, sparsely haired ears; and a nearly hairless tail with obvious scale rings. House mice are considered among the most troublesome and economically important rodents in the United States. Effective prevention and control of house mouse damage involves three aspects: rodent-proof construction, sanitation, and population reduction by means of traps, toxicants, or fumigants. The first two are useful as preventive measures, but when a house mouse infestation already exists, some form of population reduction is almost always necessary.

40|$|Artificial {{illumination}} {{has increased}} dramatically {{over the last few}} decades. In natural habitat, anthropogenic light at night may lead to changes in species composition and differences in population densities. On the individual level, the presence of artificial light may disturb the temporal organization of daily and seasonal activity. Although there is a gradual increase in knowledge on the impact of artificial light, most studies so far are correlative and make use of existing illumination. In order to experimentally study the ecological effects of artificial illumination and to assess whether these effects depend on the spectral composition of the light, we have set up a worldwide unique, large-scale research project at eight study sites in natural areas in the Netherlands. On each site, we illuminate a forest edge along three 0. 5 ha transects with white, red, and green light, and leave one transect dark. Since early 2011, we have assessed the presence of many species and species groups at all sites. Birds, <b>mice,</b> bats, <b>moths,</b> ground-dwelling insects and plants are monitored following rigid protocols; where possible we do this automatically with special equipment. Since early 2012, the lights are on from dusk to dawn and we continue to measure biodiversity and species density until the end of 2014. We study many more effects of light in different species groups; and a key element of the project is the assessment of temporal changes in physiology and behaviour. Each year, we monitor the laying date and breeding success of nest-box breeding bird species. Daily activity patterns of birds are recorded with the use of transponders and transponder readers around the nest box entrances. With automatic cameras and ultrasound recorders, we follow the activity patterns of mice and bats, respectively. Here we show the first effects of light in our experimental setup on the seasonal behaviour of birds breeding at the sites, and daily activity patterns in mice. In order to maximally utilize our setup, and to gain as much information as possible on ecological changes in response to illumination, we encourage other scientists to do research at our illuminated field sites...|$|R
40|$|White-footed mice prey on {{gypsy moth}} pupae while {{foraging}} for other, more abundant food. Mice appear capable of locally extirpating <b>moths</b> since <b>mice</b> exert high predation pressure on sparse pupae and are numerically decoupled from moth populations. Nevertheless, during 23 years of monitoring, moths persisted at scales. 1 ha despite frequent extinctions at smaller spatial scales. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous intensity in mouse foraging and/or limited moth dispersal might allow moth persistence. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, empirically parameterized model, {{we show that}} neither spatially heterogeneous predation by <b>mice,</b> nor limited <b>moth</b> dispersal alone allows moth persistence at typical mouse densities. However, synergy between both factors allows moth population persistence at naturally occurring mouse densities. For example, in models with 40 mice/ha, both limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal had a 0 % chance of moth persistence, but the combination of limited dispersal and heterogeneous predation risk resulted in a ~ 75 % chance of moth persistence. Furthermore, both for limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and for spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal, moth persistence was only guaranteed at very low mouse densities, while the combination of limited moth dispersal with heterogeneous predation guaranteed moth persistence within {{a broad range of}} mouse densities. The findings illustrate a novel mechanism of ‘‘spatial selection and satiation’’ that can enhance rare species persistence under intense incidental predation by generalist predators...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the stomach contents of house mice (Mus musculus L.) at three sites on Marion Island (47 °S, 38 °E) over a 1 -year period showed that the mice feed mostly on terrestrial macroinvertebrates but that plants (mainly seed) are {{an important component of}} the diet in mid- to late summer. Larvae of a flightless moth, weevil larvae and adults and, at one of the sites, earthworms were the invertebrate items that showed the highest importance value over the year. Diet diversity was slightly lower in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. Diet variety was lowest in midsummer and highest in either autumn or winter, depending on the site. Mean stomach-content mass was significantly higher in midwinter than during the rest of the year. When offered prey of different types and sizes, <b>mice</b> selected <b>moth</b> larvae first in 92 % of the trials; earthworms or weevil adults were most frequently selected second, and weevil larvae fourth. An introduced slug species was selected only once, as the last choice and only part of it was eaten. With both moth larvae and earthworms, the heaviest individual offered was almost always chosen first. Surprisingly, mice never consumed more than about half of the seed offered to them and their condition deteriorated severely during the trials with seed; in a third of the trials with two types of seed, the mice completely ignored the seed. The impact of mice predation on invertebrates was assessed at two of the sites - a dry mire and a coastal biotic herbfield that is influenced by seabird and seal manuring. Moth larvae and adults, weevil larvae and adults, earthworms, spiders and flies made up > 90 % of the animal remains in the stomach contents over the year and, on average, the mice daily consumed 45 g (dry mass) ha- 1 of those invertebrates at the mire and 194 g ha- 1 at the biotic site. Moth larvae made up a substantial proportion of these amounts; average daily consumption was 30 g ha- 1 at the mire and 107 g ha- 1 at the biotic site. In terms of the amount consumed in relation to biomass, the heaviest impact of mice at both sites was on weevil adults; at the biotic site mice daily consumed 13 % of weevil adult biomass in autumn and nearly 6 times the annual average biomass over the year. At the mire, slightly more than the annual average weevil adult biomass was consumed over the year. The consumption of invertebrates by mice found in this study (1992 / 1993) was about 20 % greater than in 1979 / 1980. The most striking changes in annual average consumption rate between 1979 / 1980 and 1992 / 1993 were for weevil larvae (increased nearly fourfold) and earthworms (increased sixfold at the biotic site and threefold at the mire). In contrast, the consumption of spiders at both sites decreased between 1979 / 1980 and 1992 / 1993. Articl...|$|R
