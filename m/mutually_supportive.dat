25|$|Operation Phiboonpol {{had ended}} in an indecisive standoff, despite heavy Communist casualties. Military Region 4's (MR 4) Commanding Officer General Phasouk Somly was {{hesitant}} to try another attack {{because of the}} poor fighting qualities of his troops. However, on 1 July 1971, King Sisavang Vatthana paid a royal visit to Pakse and demanded another offensive. Thus it was that Pakse Unit of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) planned an offensive into communist territory on the eastern Bolovens Plateau designed to block one of the supply arteries of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Route 23. It would also retake two airstrips while occupying the Bolovens Plateau. The plan was for a two phase operation involving not just troops from Pakse's (MR 4), but also from adjoining Military Region 3 (MR 3). As projected, the Royalist force of 11 battalions numbered 4,000 strong; the opposing three Communist battalions could muster barely 1,100 troops. In phase one, MR 3's guerrillas would be airlifted to capture the Pakse 47 airfield southwest of Salavan at UTM coordinates XC5237. Phase two would be a squeeze play; a mobile force would be airlifted to a position northwest of Paksong, while a column probed eastward toward it along Route 23. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) would supply close air support {{at the rate of}} two AC-47 and 35 T-28 sorties daily. Belatedly, the planners realized that RLAF support would be insufficient. Three days before the operation's scheduled start, they requested and received a commitment for 12 daily sorties of tactical air for the next month. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would fly interdiction strikes on the communist lines of communication with fighter-bombers by day and gunships by night. However, USAF support would not be on a dedicated basis; instead it would be diverted as needed. Logistical air support would come from USAF helicopters, RLAF transports, and Air America under contract. Not taken into account {{was the fact that the}} Royalist columns were not <b>mutually</b> <b>supportive.</b> General Minh, commander of the PAVN battalions, would use this flaw to defeat the Royalists in detail by using his interior lines of communication.|$|E

To ensure that his fleet {{was in a position}} to intercept the French whichever tack they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up <b>mutually</b> <b>supportive</b> positions.

The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, Alexandre under Captain François Charles Guillemet far to the rear and only [...] from the British vanguard. Alexandre had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a sharp engagement with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a project report on NP, a working Natural language Plan inference system that uses feature structures {{and is based}} on assumptions. Input to the system {{is in the form of}} feature structures, which can be taken directly from the output of a semantic parser. Plan actions are represented by feature-structure plan schemata with preconditions, hierarchical decompositions, and effects. Output is in the form of a network of believed assertions represented in a knowledge base, and can be reported, used to answer generation-system queries, or drive side-effecting demons. The plan inference component is implemented using a feature-structure-based inference engine and models of plan recognition, prediction, and inference. The inference engine is implemented using a rewriting system for pattern-matching, and an Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) for conjunctions. The ATMS allows pre-instantiation of hypothetically known assertions and implications, which can significantly reduce processing time. The ATMS also permits simultaxeous consideration of multiple possible inputs or multiple possible inferred plan outputs; these can be <b>mutually</b> conflicting or <b>supportive.</b> This capability will be important for disambiguation.

Over time and using a process of participatory reviews with multiple stakeholders, the system evolved into a network of CAHWs. The study focused on CAHWs service sustainability and their relationships with other animal health service providers. A <b>mutually</b> beneficial and <b>supportive</b> arrangement existed between the CAHWs and Animal Health Assistants (AHAs), based on a private drug supply system, referral and backstopping support. The CAHWs derived sufficient income from their veterinary work to maintain their interest in the system.

40|$|Developing and {{strengthening}} a more mutualistic {{relationship between the}} science of restoration ecology {{and the practice of}} ecological restoration has been a central but elusive goal of SERI since its inaugural meeting in 1989. We surveyed the delegates to the 2009 SERI World Conference to learn more about their perceptions of and ideas for improving restoration science, practice, and scientist/practitioner relationships. The respondents' assessments of restoration practice were less optimistic than their assessments of restoration science. Only 26 % believed that scientist/practitioner relationships were “generally <b>mutually</b> beneficial and <b>supportive</b> of each other,” and the “science–practice gap” was the second and third most frequently cited category of factors limiting the science and practice of restoration, respectively (“insufficient funding” was first in both cases). Although few faulted practitioners for ignoring available science, many criticized scientists for ignoring the pressing needs of practitioners and/or failing to effectively communicate their work to nonscientists. Most of the suggestions for bridging the gap between restoration science and practice focused on (1) developing the necessary political support for more funding of restoration science, practice, and outreach; and (2) creating alternative research paradigms to both facilitate on-the-ground projects and promote more mutualistic exchanges between scientists and practitioners. We suggest that one way to implement these recommendations is to create a “Restoration Extension Service” modeled after the United States Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service. We also recommend more events that bring together a fuller spectrum of restoration scientists, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders...|$|R

Communal coping, a process that entails the identification of a stressor as “our ” issue and “our ” responsibility, has traditionally been examined {{in the context of}} large-scale natural disasters or war or of family sys-tems. This study examines communal coping behavior among 11 elderly residents of a continuing-care retirement community.

40|$|Purpose – This {{paper has}} two objectives. The {{first is to}} see whether “shared values” is an {{important}} intermediary, {{or part of the}} “black box” (along with organisational commitment and job satisfaction), between HRM practices and firm performance. The second is to assess whether the use of multiple levels of respondents produces different results compared with the usual practice of using senior HRM managers or, in lieu, another senior manager. Design/methodology/approach – A survey methodology is used to obtain perceptual data on HRM practices and a variety of work-related attitudes. The sample comprises managers, supervisors and workers from 27 New Zealand firms. Statistical analysis, using SPSS, was performed at the firm and individual level. Findings – At group-level there are wide differences in attitudes towards HRM activities. The desirability of using as many respondents as possible, and also respondents from different levels within organisations, was confirmed. “Shared values” is also deemed worthy of inclusion in the “black box” as it relates significantly to perceptions of HRM practices. However, organisational commitment and job satisfaction appear to have a stronger role. Research limitations/implications – Current writings suggest that certain HRM practices can foster a system of shared values amongst the workforce. The study finds this indeed to be the case at the individual level. However, the supposition that a shared value system significantly contributes to the promotion of other desirable attitudinal outcomes has not been supported by the study's findings. A limitation of the study is that it did not explore the HRM-firm performance relationship in its entirety. Further research exploring all linkages in this relationship is now required. Practical implications – The paper concludes that practitioners should be wary of pursuing an agenda that sees the development of a shared value system as the key to superior firm performance. Instead, it is suggested that the values of the organisation should be considered as the foundation from which a set of <b>mutually</b> reinforcing and <b>supportive</b> HRM practices is developed. Originality/value – The paper provides much needed empirical data on shared values and their role in the HRM-performance relationship. Attitudes, Human resource management, New Zealand...|$|R
