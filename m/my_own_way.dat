5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Way</b> out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

[...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it...

Fassbender had auditioned for an earlier Matthew Vaughn project, {{and the director}} had remembered him and sent Fassbender the X-Men script. Though Fassbender knew little of the superhero team, he {{became interested in the}} part after reading the script and familiarizing himself with Magneto in the comic books. Fassbender, who considered Lehnsherr as a Machiavellian character who is neither good nor evil, watched Sir Ian McKellen's performances to get the flavor of Magneto, but ultimately chose to [...] "paint a new canvas" [...] with the character, [...] "just going <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and working with whatever is in the comic books and the script."

500|$|In May 2008, Johansson {{released}} her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, {{which consists of}} one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits' songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics {{found it to be}} [...] "surprisingly alluring", [...] "a bravely eccentric selection", and [...] "a brilliant album" [...] with [...] "ghostly magic". NME named the album the [...] "23rd best album of 2008"; it peaked at number126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson later spoke of the opportunity she had to record the album, adding, [...] "I thought I would do maybe an album of standards, because I'm not a songwriter. I'm a vocalist." [...] She started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old. In an interview, Johansson said of Waits, [...] "His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> of doing Tom Waits songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E
