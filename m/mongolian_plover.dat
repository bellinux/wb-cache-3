50|$|There {{are five}} races, {{and the large}} east Asian forms, C. m. mongolus and C. m. stegmanni, are {{sometimes}} given specific status as <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plovers,</b> Charadrius mongolus. If the taxonomic split is accepted, lesser sand plover as then defined becomes Charadrius atrifrons, including the three races atrifrons, pamirensis and schaeferi.|$|R
40|$|Adult worms of Parvatrema spp. (Digenea: Gymnophallidae) {{were found}} in the {{intestines}} of 2 species of migratory birds, i. e., a great knot, Calidris tenuirostris, and 2 <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plovers,</b> Charadrius mongolus, in the coastal area of Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do in October 2009. The recovered Parvatrema worms were 79 in total number and composed of 2 species. The worms from a great knot were 289 µm in length with the oral and ventral sucker ratio of 2 : 1. They had a single vitellarium, and their intrauterine eggs were 25. 0 × 17. 5 µm in size. These findings were compatible with P. duboisi (Dollfus, 1923) Bartoli, 1974 (syn. P. timondavidi Bartoli, 1963). The worms recovered from the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plovers</b> were smaller in length than P. duboisi and had 2 vitellaria. The oral and ventral sucker ratio was 2. 5 : 1, and the eggs were 17. 5 × 8. 8 µm in size. These worms were assigned to be P. homoeotecnum James, 1964. This is the first report on the natural final hosts of Parvatrema spp. in Korea...|$|R
50|$|It breeds {{above the}} tree line in the Himalayas and discontinuously across to bare coastal plains in {{north-eastern}} Siberia, with the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover</b> {{in the eastern part}} of the range; it has also bred in Alaska. It nests in a bare ground scrape, laying three eggs. This species is strongly migratory, wintering on sandy beaches in east Africa, south Asia and Australasia. It is a very rare vagrant in western Europe, but of the three individuals recorded in Great Britain up to 2003, one was a <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the migratory}} species include the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover,</b> eastern curlew, grey-tailed tattler and bar-tailed godwit. Other birds seen the reserve include pied oystercatchers, beach thick-knees, darters, little black cormorants, white-faced herons, Australian white ibis, great egrets, grass owls, {{whistling}} kites and brahminy kites.|$|E
5000|$|Inhaca is home {{to about}} 300 bird species, both {{resident}} and migratory. Species of conservation concern are the pink-backed pelican, lesser crested tern, crab plover, greater sand plover, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover,</b> Terek sandpiper, southern banded snake eagle, mangrove kingfisher, grey-rumped swallow and spotted ground-thrush. The southerly Nhaquene Swamp and Saco Bay are strongholds for the sooty falcon, while terns roost on northerly Portuguese Island [...] Bird species of limited distribution are Rudd's apalis, Neergaard's sunbird and pink-throated twinspot. House crows are present since the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the many}} birds {{that can be}} spotted feeding on the diverse fauna variety of worms and molluscs, are whimbrel, common greenshank, common redshank, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover,</b> curlew sandpiper, marsh sandpiper and Pacific golden plover, yellow bittern and {{cinnamon}} bittern. Lucky visitors to the reserve {{may be able to}} spot the resident family of smooth otters, as well as the rare lesser whistling-duck, and the rare milky stork. The reserve forms part of the Kranji-Mandai Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports Chinese egrets, greater spotted eagles and greater crested terns. Atlas moth, the largest species of moth in Southeast Asia {{can be found in the}} back mangrove.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adults of Maritrema obstipum (Digenea: Microphallidae) {{were found}} in the {{intestines}} of 4 species of migratory birds, including the sanderling (Crocethia alba), Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrines), <b>Mongolian</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius mongolus), and red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis), collected from Yubu Island, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. The worms of were 451 × 265 µm in size, and were easily identifiable as Maritrema species by the presence of the cirrus sac, and the ring-like distribution of the vitellaria. More specifically, the ejaculatory duct curved posteromedially, and the 2 parts of vitelline follicles were found to be distinct at the posterior end. The eggs were brown-colored, and 19. 8 × 12. 3 µm in size. All these findings implicated M. obstipum as the pertinent species of the worms. Beside these, adult worms of Gynaecotyla squatarolae, Parvatrema duboisi, and Acanthoparyphium sp. were also discovered. This is the first report establishing migratory birds as the natural definitive hosts for M. obstipum.

40|$|Migratory {{activity}} of waders departing from north-western Australia in March-April 1991 was recorded by field observations and radar tracking. Field observations {{showed that the}} species concerned were mainly Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola and Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris. Peak migration {{took place in the}} second week of April. Most flocks departed in the late afternoon, never at high tide. A strong correlation was found between the tidal cycle and the timing of departures. The majority of the flocks flew towards NNW. Given that the next stopover site of especially the larger sized waders is in east and south China (Barter & Wang 1990) this observed departure direction is more westerly than a course along the great circle route (0 -degree). Wind patterns along two possible northward routes (a great circle and an island hopping route along the island-arc of South-east Asia) are analysed. In view of recoveries of waders ringed in Australia, especially the smaller waders (<b>Mongolian</b> <b>Plover</b> Charadrius mongolus, Large Sandplover Charadrius leschenaultii, Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis, Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea, Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus, Terek Sandpiper Xenus cinereus) may migrate via the island hopping route, while the larger ones (Grey Plover, Great Knot, Red Knot Calidris canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus and Eastern Curlew Numenius madagascariensis) take a direct, great circle flight to China. Considerable tail wind assistance can be gained during the northward trip, more so along the island arc than along the great circle. Flight range estimates indicate that the smaller waders cannot fly the 4500 - 5500 km nonstop to east and south China, while the larger species can, on the condition that they experience tail wind assistance...|$|E
