50|$|Harry Clasper {{was born}} in Dunston, {{now part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, but then an {{independent}} village on the south bank of the River Tyne, a mile upriver from Gateshead. Later his family moved to Jarrow, also on the south bank on the Tyne, downriver from Newcastle. At the age of 15, he began to work at Jarrow Pit, which was notorious <b>for</b> <b>firedamp.</b> After a while Clasper decided that mining did not suit him and he became apprenticed as a ship's carpenter in Brown's Boatyard, Jarrow. There he learnt about woodworking and the principles of boatbuilding. This would be useful to him in later life.|$|R

5000|$|... {{describes}} {{the testing of}} a mine <b>for</b> <b>firedamp.</b> A candle is prepared by being trimmed and excess fat removed. It is held at arm's length at floor level in one hand, the other hand shielding out all except {{the tip of the}} flame. As the candle is raised the tip is observed and if unchanged the atmosphere is safe. If however the tip turns bluish-gray increasing in height to a thin extended point becoming a deeper blue, then firedamp is present. [...] Upon detecting firedamp the candle is lowered and arrangements made for the ventilating of the area or the deliberate firing of the firedamp after the end of a shift. [...] A man, known as a fireman (US/Canada), penitent or monk (both from the protective garb) edged forward with a candle {{on the end of a}} stick. He kept his head down to allow the explosion to pass over him, but as soon as the explosion had occurred stood upright as much as possible to avoid the afterdamp.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{maintain}} the safety level of electrical equipment and diesel engines used in French coal <b>mines</b> <b>susceptible</b> to firedamp, INERIS and Charbonnages de France (CdF) have developed with the contribution of Houillères du Bassin de Lorraine a certification procedure for the workshops which repair such equipment. Due to the decreasing plan of CdF workers, the inadequacy of some manufacturers and the missing of some others, the use of external workshops for the repairing is more and more frequent. So, it is necessary for safety reasons to ensure that such repairs are conducted in optimal conditions. The aim of Saqr-ATEX certification is to ensure that the quality and the traceability of repaired equipment used in gassy coal mines give an equivalent safety level to the new equipment one. In order to be attractive for workshops, Saqr-ATEX is not only usable for ATEX coal mine equipment but also for ATEX equipment installed in every location where hazardous atmosphere could occur...|$|R

40|$|Background: Community {{acquired}} MRSA (CAMRSA) infections affect patients {{without risk}} factors. CAMRSA infections can be serious and also fatal even in previously healthy subjects. CA-MRSA differs from hospital acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). CA-MRSA is more <b>susceptible</b> <b>for</b> non-beta-lactam antibiotics than HA-MRSA, has different PFGE subtypes, and can produce Panton-Valentine leukocidine. Methods: In Institute of Public Health Kranj we routinely perform epidemiologic survey of MRSA positive patients. We compared MRSA isolates from patients {{with and without}} risk factors for acquisition of MRSA. We tested all S. aureus for their susceptibility to antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacine, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim – sulfamethoxazole and rifampin). All CA-MRSA isolates were tested for susceptibility to fusidic acid staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) production. We performed macrorestriction chromosome analysis with pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We compared CA-MRSA characteristics with epidemic MRSA strains. Results: In the period from 1999 to 2004 we isolated 1439 MRSA including 10 isolates suspicious for CA-MRSA. This isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>for</b> more than 5 antibiotics in contrast to epidemic MRSA which were <b>susceptible</b> <b>for</b> 3 or 5 antibiotics. Eight of 10 CA-MRSA produced SE C or D or no SE, in contrast to epidemic MRSA, which produced exclusively SE A. In PFGE CA-MRSA showed different patterns compared to epidemic HA-MRSA. Conclusions: With exclusion of risk factors for MRSA acquisition in patient’s history testing for antibiotic susceptibility, SE production and PFGE we proved that our MRSA isolates differed from ordinary epidemic strains. We identified CA-MRSA also in Slovenia. </p...|$|R

Methods Nine strains of Atopobium vaginae, four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of Lactobacillus iners and one strain each of Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the Etest.
