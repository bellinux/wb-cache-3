During 1998 - 2001 we examined population parameters and evaluated some potential limiting factors for this isolated and sedentary population. The total population (breeding and non-breeding birds) was monitored annually. In addition, 26 fledglings and 33 immatures (6 years old birds) and immature annual survival rates were similar, around 90 %. Adult survival was lower than expected as territorial birds seem more susceptible to poisoning. Immature survival could be favoured by the existence of regular feeding places. Casualties from power lines was {{the main cause of}} mortality (12 cases during the study period). Blood sampling revealed high frequencies of lead poisoning: 13. 5 and 2. 7 % of individuals showed sub-clinical and clinical intoxication levels, respectively, probably caused by the ingestion of lead shot. Priority conservation measures should be directed to reduce electrocution risks, illegal poisoning, and lead contamination. Population reinforcement with birds coming from other populations is not recommended as previous information reveals morphological and genetic differentiation of Canarian Egyptian vultures compared with continental populations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The classical debate on the convenience or not of the PNV concept has been recently revived in the Canary Islands, where pollen records of pre-anthropic vegetation seemed to strongly disagree with the existing PNV reconstructions. Contrastingly, more recent PNV model outputs from the Azores Islands show outstanding parallelisms with pre-anthropic pollen records, at least in qualitative terms. We suggest the development of more detailed quantitative studies to compare these methodologies as an opportunity for improving the performance of both.

40|$|Oceanic {{islands are}} of {{fundamental}} {{importance for the}} conservation of biodiversity because they exhibit high endemism rates coupled with fast extinction rates. Nowhere in Europe is this pattern more conspicuous than in the <b>Macaronesian</b> biogeographic <b>region.</b> A large network of protected areas within the region has been developed, but the question of whether these areas will still be climatically suitable for the globally threatened endemic element in the coming decades remains open. Here, we make predictions on the fate of the Macaronesian endemic bryophyte flora in the context of ongoing climate change. The potential distribution of 35 Macaronesian endemic bryophyte species was assessed under present and future climate conditions using an ensemble modelling approach. Projections of the models under different climate change scenarios predicted an average decrease of suitable areas of 62 - 87 % per species and a significant elevational increase by 2070, so that even the commonest species were predicted to fit either the Vulnerable or Endangered IUCN categories. Complete extinctions were foreseen for six of the studied Macaronesian endemic species. Given the uncertainty regarding the capacity of endemic species to track areas of suitable climate within and outside the islands, active management associated to an effective monitoring program is suggested.

40|$|The Canary Islands' laurel {{forest is}} a montane {{evergreen}} forest {{formation of an}} outstanding floristic and biogeographic value. It is endemic to several islands of the <b>Macaronesian</b> biogeographic <b>region,</b> confined to the humid areas limited by {{the influence of the}} trade wind clouds. In recent times this relict forest vegetation, which once covered large proportions of the Canary Islands, suffered from a massive range reduction and fragmentation due to human exploitation. This thesis evaluates the phylogeography and population structure of the laurel forest on the basis of two characteristic plant taxa representative for the whole vegetation complex: The widespread and dominant canopy-building tree species Laurus novocanariensis and the more constrictive Canary Island endemic Ixanthus viscosus. Analyses exhibit low levels of differentiation on within- as well as between-island level. Especially for Laurus the exchange between populations from different islands, even over longer distances, is obvious. On island level the forest fragmentation has low impact on population divergence up to now. Furthermore, we localised the genetic hotspots of both model species within the laurel forest distribution range on Tenerife. A small-scale grid square sampling strategy combined with approaches from population and landscape genetics enabled the development of detailed maps showing the centres of genetic diversity and thus revealing the connection between forest fragmentation and diversity loss. Additionally, we analysed the ecological preferences of the two species, recognising not abiotic factors, but rather past forest degradation as having the most important impact on the current distribution range of the endemic Ixanthus. Based on these findings we discuss the necessity and opportunities for conservation strategies of the Canary Islands' laurel forest in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|The oceans cover 70 % of the Earth´s {{surface and}} harbor {{most of the}} planet´s biodiversity. However the {{microbiological}} component of this diversity remains relatively unexplored. Marine actinomycetes, are a robust resource of chemically prolific novelty. Producing structurally unique biological active secondary metabolites, generating a valuable source for innovative biotechnology and drug discovery [1, 2]. As a consequence, the ecological role of actinomycetes and their marine ecosystems {{may no longer be}} neglected. It is crucial to move our research efforts into ocean regions for which we know little or nothing about the indigenous microbial diversity. The Portuguese Archipelago, Madeira is located in the <b>Macaronesian</b> Atlantic <b>region,</b> emerging from the African tectonic plate, found in the extreme south of the Tore-Madeira ridge, has a unique biogeography and biodiversity. These distinctive characteristics combined with the fact that Madeira have never been explored, as far as indigenous marine actinomycetes are concerned, makes it from the scientific point of view, the perfect target for our studies. From 662 marine sediment samples collected along Madeira Archipelago (Figure 1) during June of 2012, covering depths from 10 - 1310 m, a total of 421 actinomycete strains were isolated. In a previous study, an assemblage of 82 strains was selected for taxonomic identification, having into account representative morphological diversity characteristics of the actinomycetes, isolated from Madeira Archipelago. Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, it was observed that the genera Streptomyces, Micromonospora and Salinispora were predominant, 81 % [3]. Additionally, in a recent study, our team selected 168 strains with Salinispora look-alike morphological features. From these 28 strains were identified as belonging to the seawater-obligate marine actinomycete genus Salinispora. Representing the first report of Salinispora spp. in the <b>Macaronesian</b> Atlantic Ocean <b>region</b> and suggesting a more globally distribution of this genus than previously supposed (unplublished results). In this study further 82 strains from Madeira Archipelago (out of 421) were selected for taxonomic identification, taking into account small groups of strains (1 - 4) evidencing very diverse morphological appearances, as exemplified in Figure 2. Using the same experimental microbiology identification tools, 8 genera were identified. However it was perceived that, the genera Streptomyces, Nocardiopsis and Actinomycetospora were predominant (93 %), Figure 3. The phylogenetic trees built for the 82 taxonomically identified strains performed in this study are presented in Figures 4, 5 and 6. To date, having into account the present work and previous studies, our research group have identified from the actinomycetes isolated from Madeira´s ocean sediments, genera Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Salinispora, Nocardiopsis, Verrucosispora, Kocuria, Nonomuraea, Nocardia, Brevibacterium, Mycobacterium, Marinobacter, Actinomadura, Micrococcus, Actinomycetospora, Pseudonocardia, Gordonia and Millisia. From which genera Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Salinispora evidence a major representation. Crude extracts were obtained from all 421 strains and tested for their ability to produce natural products with bioactive properties: (i) antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and Candida albicans strains; and (ii) cytotoxic activity against the HCT- 116 cell line. A screening positive rate of 2. 4 % for antimicrobial MRSA and VRE assays and 3. 2 % for cytotoxic HCT- 116 assay was obtained (submitted manuscripts). These studies demonstrate that the <b>Macaronesian</b> Atlantic Ocean <b>region</b> is a rich source of marine actinomycete biodiversity with potential industrial applications. Figure 1.

40|$|Islands {{constitute}} natural laboratories for {{the study}} of evolutionary and ecological processes due to their discrete and isolated nature. Island biotas tend to be species–poor and disharmonic compared to the mainland; typically, interspecific competition is low, and entire groups of predators, parasitoids or pathogens are absent from their biotas, so the ecological space is often not fully saturated. Consequently, species from island assemblages often use a wider range of resources than their counterparts from the source mainland. Here, I investigate whether island parasitoid communities have proportionally more generalist species than their source mainland, and which factors determine island community structure. These questions were approached using data on the distribution of Ichneumonoidea (Hymenoptera) species worldwide and with data from a survey conducted in the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region.</b> Prior to the global analyses, I assessed whether islands and archipelagos follow the same species–area relationship, and identified which islands have comparable inventories. Globally, islands have proportionally more idiobionts (i. e. generalists) than continental areas. However, there is a latitudinal gradient in the level of generalism of island parasitoid faunas that correlates with some environmental factors and island characteristics; the species pool is the most important determinant of island community structure, together with temperature (for braconids) or biogeographical region (for ichneumonids). Host and parasitoid larvae collected in different islands of the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region</b> and adjacent mainland were assigned to Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units using a protocol based on host dissection and DNA barcoding. At this scale, mainland faunas have proportionally more koinobiont species and island communities have a greater proportion of idiobionts. Although overall parasitism rates were similar between islands and mainland, islands had higher idiobiont parasitism rates than expected by chance. In summary, results from this thesis indicate that indeed island parasitoid faunas are biased towards generalist species.

To determine the variation within forms by sequencing over 400 specimens, thereby allowing the discovery of cryptic forms and resolving {{some of the issues}} raised previously. This extensive sampling was also used to shed light on distributions and to explain genetic diversity by comparing the ages and ecological and geological features of the islands (size, elevation and habitat diversity). Location] The Cape Verde Islands: an oceanic archipelago belonging to the <b>Macaronesian</b> biogeographic <b>region,</b> located around 500 km off Senegal. [Methods] A total of 405 new specimens of Tarentola geckos were collected from nine islands with very different geological histories, topography, climate and habitats. Mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene and 12 S rRNA partial sequences were obtained and analysed using phylogenetic methods and networks to determine molecular diversity, demographic features and phylogeographic patterns. [Results] The phylogenetic relationships between all known forms of Cape Verdean Tarentola specimens were estimated for the first time, {{the relationships between}} new forms were assessed and previously hypothesized relationships were re-examined. Despite the large sample size, low intraspecific diversity was found using a 303 -bp cyt b fragment. Star-like haplotype networks and statistical tests suggest the past occurrence of a rapid demographic and geographical expansion over most of the islands. Genetic variability is positively correlated with size, elevation and habitat diversity of the islands, but is not linearly related to the age of the islands. Biogeographical patterns have, in general, high concordance with phylogenetic breaks and with the three eco-geographical island groups. Volcanism and habitat diversity, both tightly linked with island ontogeny, as postulated by the general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography, as well as present and historical size of the islands appear to be the main factors explaining the genetic diversity of this group. [Main conclusions] The Tarentola radiation was clarified and is clearly associated with the geological and ecological features of the islands. Two factors may account for the low intraspecific variation: (1) recent volcanic activity and high ecological stress, and (2) poor habitat diversity within some islands. More studies are needed to align taxonomy with phylogenetic relationships, whereas GIS modelling may help to predict precise species distributions. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|According to {{the current}} legal {{background}} for the regulation of genetically modified plants (GMPs) in Europe, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed considering i) the crop plant, ii) the novel trait relating to its intended effect and phenotypic characteristics of the GM crop plant and iii) the receiving environment related to the intended use of the GMP. However, the current GMP-ERA does not differentiate between different intended receiving environments. Therefore, the question is to be raised: How can the ’receiving environment’ be classified on the European scale, both in an ecologically relevant and feasible way? As a first step this proposal focuses on invertebrates in the terrestrial environmental compartment. In order to check if already existing regionalization concepts are suitable for the above raised question the following selection criteria were employed: Distribution of non-target organisms (NTOs) : A suitable regionalization concept should appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of the animal and plant communities of the different receiving environments of a GMP. Therefore, such a classification should be done by an ecoregion approach, meaning that different ecoregions support different organism communities that may play a different role in supporting relevant ecosystem services. However, information {{on the distribution of}} invertebrates in Europe is not available in sufficient detail for this purpose. Hence, it is proposed to use the information about site conditions like climatic, vegetation and soil parameters, which determine the composition of invertebrate communities, for the selection of an appropriate classification concept. Size and number of geographical units: This is a trade-off between the total number of ‘receiving environments’ in Europe manageable in a regulatory context and the ecological uniformity of a single geographical unit. An intermediate size and number of geographical units should be the aim of the classification. With the ‘Indicative map of European biogeographical regions’ (IMEBR) there is an existing regionalization concept that meets many of the requirements identified above: the classification is based on parameters that also determine the distribution of invertebrate communities (i. e., the potential natural vegetation) and nine biogeographical regions represented within the 27 member states of the European (EU- 27) are a manageable number for regulatory purposes. However, epigeic (living above ground) and endogeic (living below ground) faunal communities are determined by different biotic and abiotic parameters. For example, climate data is much more relevant for epigeic species than for endogeic organisms. The most important soil properties related to the distribution of endogeic organisms and plants are pH, texture, organic matter content and/or content of organic carbon, C/N ratio, and water-holding capacity. Hence, for endogeic non-target organisms there is currently no suitable regionalization concept available. For the time being, it is recommended to identify important species for testing purposes in each ecoregion with GMP cultivation by means of expert knowledge using the IMEBR for both epigeic and endogeic communities. The regionalization concept is intended {{to be used in the}} context of the ERA of GMPs for the assessment of risk for NTOs. Hence, it should be tailored for the area in the EU where GMPs are likely to be grown. The overlap between the biogeographical regions and the intended area of cultivation for a novel GMP form the different cases, each of which should undergo a specific ERA process. For example, there would be eight or nine separate potato cases for the EU- 27 area, i. e. the Alpine, Atlantic, Boreal, Continental, Macaronesian, Mediterranean, Pannonian, Steppic and possibly the Black Sea biogeographical regions. For grain maize there would be five to nine separate cases, i. e. the Atlantic, Continental, Mediterranean, Pannonian, Steppic and possibly the Alpine, Black Sea, Boreal and <b>Macaronesian</b> biogeographical <b>regions...</b>|$|R

A catalog and critical review of species and infraspecific taxa of non-fossil geniculate coralline red algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) previously reported from the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region</b> are presented along with an assessment of species diversity in the region. Published records of geniculate coralline algae are included along with comments relating to type material. Within the catalog, taxa are organized alphabetically by genus and within this by final epithet. From the 31 taxa recorded, 4 are based on type collections from Macaronesian localities. The types of most species and infraspecific taxa reported from the region {{have yet to be}} re-examined in a modern context, and most Macaronesian records require verification. The biodiversity of Macaronesian geniculate coralline algae may be lower than current information indicates...|$|E
40|$|Aeonium {{species are}} plants rich in phenols and terpenoids {{and have been}} widely used in the Canary folk medicine. Following our project {{concerning}} bioactive compounds from <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region,</b> a phytochemical study was carried out to investigate the constituents of the stems of Aeonium lindleyi Webb & Berthel.,Crassulaceae. Air dried and chopped stems of this plant were extracted with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus and the total extract was chromatographed on silica gel to afford sixteen known compounds including, one sterol, four lupane triterpenes and eleven phenolic compounds. Their structures were elucidated by means of ¹H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopic studies and comparison of their spectral data with values in the literature. Both group of isolated metabolites are known by their diverse biological activities and they have been described as antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory. Our results contribute to the knowledge of A. lindleyi as a potential source of bioactive compounds...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} (2007 - 2009), the {{distribution}} and associated flora of maerl beds in southern Portugal (Algarve) were investigated by dredging and SCUBA diving (12 - 30 m depth). The present work provides the first data on the non-coralline crustose flora associated with maerl beds in Portugal. Peyssonnelia bornetii is a new record for Atlantic European coasts, and new records for Portugal are "Rhododiscus pulcherrimus" (sporophyte phase of Atractophora hypnoides), Contarinia peyssonneliaeformis, "Cruoria rosea" (sporophyte phase of Halarachnion ligulatum), Peyssonnelia armorica, and "Aglaozonia chilosa" (sporophyte phase of Cutleria chilosa). In addition, the records of three other species (Hildenbrandia crouaniorum, Peyssonnelia dubyi, and Peyssonnelia harveyana) completed the distribution gap between the North Iberian Peninsula and the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region.</b> The female and carposporangial structures of C. peyssonneliaeformis and P. bornetii are described for the first time. The diversity and species composition observed are compared with previous studies from maerl beds in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Galicia) and neighboring areas in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In order to facilitate and promote further studies of the crustose flora of subtidal habitats along European coasts, an identification key is provided for the 26 crustose taxa associated with maerl and gravel beds of the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|Species {{richness}} on oceanic islands {{has been}} related {{to a series of}} ecological factors including island size and isolation (i. e. the Equilibrium Model of Island Biogeography, EMIB), habitat diversity, climate (i. e., temperature and precipitation) and more recently island ontogeny (i. e. the General Dynamic Model of oceanic island biogeography, GDM). Here we evaluate the relationship of these factors with the diversity of bryophytes in the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region</b> (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands and Cape Verde). The predictive power of EMIB, habitat diversity, climate and the GDM on total bryophyte richness, as well as moss and liverwort richness (the two dominant bryophyte groups), was evaluated through ordinary least squares regressions. After choosing the best subset of variables using inference statistics, we used partial regression analyses to identify the independent and shared effects of each model. The variables included within each model were similar for mosses and liverworts, with orographic mist layer being {{one of the most important}} predictors of richness. Models combining climate with either the GDM or habitat diversity explained most of richness variation (up to 91 %). There was a high portion of shared variance between all pairwise combinations of factors in mosses, while in liverworts around half o...|$|E

Macroalgae, are largely used in food, {{pharmaceutical}} and cosmetics industries. Cystoseira abies-marina (S. G. Gmelin) C. Agardh is a brown macroalgae (Phaeophyta) which belongs to Cystoseira genus and is {{distributed in the}} Mediterranean, <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>Region</b> and the coast of Africa. In the Azores lslands, it grows abundantly in the intertidal zone where it is pioneer and attains large size. Since intertidal seaweeds are exposed to extreme stress conditions (temperatura, UV, water levei) in addition to herbivory and fouling, they develop protective mechanisms, some of which involve the biosynthesis of metabolites with properties that {{may be useful to}} man (e. g. natural antioxidants, antifouling agents, novel UV sunscreens). The dichlormethane extract of C. abies-marina from Azares was studied revealing the presence of meronorditerpenoids with cytotoxic and antioxidant activities. In this research the antioxidant activity and chemical composition of the ethyl acetate fraction of C. abies-marina methanolic extract was studied. C. abies-marina was collected in two phases of its life cycle üuvenile phase and mature phase). […].

40|$|Species of the dinoflagellate genus Gambierdiscus are {{the cause}} of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning which is very common in {{tropical}} areas, mainly in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Until 2008 this disease was not reported in the NE Atlantic Ocean, when human intoxications after consumption of local fish have been reported almost yearly in the Canary Islands. Sampling of tidal ponds on rocky shores of this archipelago has revealed an unexpected diversity of the genus Gambierdiscus in the area. Morphological and phylogenetic studies of culture isolates established the presence {{of at least three}} different species: G. excentricus (originally described in the Canaries), G. australes, and a third species soon to be formally characterized, with close characteristics to G. polynesiensis and Gambierdiscus sp. type 4 sensu Xu et al (2014). The evaluation of toxicity in these species was performed by mouse bioassay (MBA) and erythrocyte lyses assay (ELA). Additionally, identification of the CTXs congeners will be conducted using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses. Nevertheless, the link between local Gambierdiscus populations and ciguateric fish has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Future studies should focus more efforts on the phylogeography of Gambierdiscus in the Canaries, the distribution and abundance of their populations, and the characterization of toxin profiles in cultures vs those in local fishes to understand if ciguatoxins are accumulated in Canaries waters or other surrounding areas in the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region...</b>|$|E
40|$|Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2010. Oceanic islands {{have been}} the grand stage of {{documented}} extinctions. In view of limited resources, efficient prioritization is crucial to avoid the extinction of taxa. This work lists the top 100 management priority species for the European archipelagos of the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>region</b> (Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands), taking into account both their protection priority and their management feasibility. Bryophytes, vascular plants, molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates were scored by species experts following two sets of criteria: (i) protection priority, including ecological value, singularity, public institutions’ management responsibilities and social value; (ii) management feasibility, including threats knowledge and control feasibility, external socio-economical support for management and biological recovery potential. Environmental managers weighted the same criteria according to their management importance. Final species scores were determined by the combination of both species valuation and criteria weighting. Vascular plants dominate the Top 100 list, followed by arthropods and vertebrates. The majority of listed taxa are endemic to one archipelago or even to a single island. The management feasibility criteria did not dictate that all taxa must be eminently endangered, as {{for most of the}} species it should be relatively easy to control threats. The main advantages of this process are the independent participation of scientists and conservation managers, the inclusion of criteria on both protection priority and management feasibility and the taxonomically unbiased nature of the process. This study provides a potentially useful biodiversity conservation tool for the Macaronesian archipelagos that could be readily implemented by the respective regional governments in future legislation...|$|E
