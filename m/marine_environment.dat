5|$|In 1938, Rolls-Royce {{started work}} on modifying some Merlins which were later {{to be used}} in British MTBs, MGBs, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were {{modified}} single-stage units and the engine was re-engineered for use in a <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which {{are very difficult to}} clean up, and last for years in the sediment and <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, {{as the same}} environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal region}} of {{northern}} New South Wales, Australia is experiencing dramatic population growth {{as well as}} being an important regional destination. The qualities of the natural landscape and <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> have been a central feature in the region 2 ̆ 7 s attraction and appeal. This study considered the importance of the region 2 ̆ 7 s <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> for leisure-related purposes. A total of 267 visitors and local residents of Coffs Coast were surveyed about their activities and the importance of the region 2 ̆ 7 s <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> to them. Both residents and visitors held high opinions {{of the quality of the}} region 2 ̆ 7 s <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> and its importance to their leisure. The analysis found Coffs Coast <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> to be important for the regular leisure activities of those living in close proximity, as well as for visitors. The preferred marine leisure activities included beach walking, swimming, and surfing. Respondents described the marine landscape as distinctive in its accessibility and uncrowdedness. Findings indicate that marine resources are used regularly by residents and visitors who reported a strong desire for the naturalness and integrity of <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> to be retained...|$|R
50|$|Many {{similarly}} sized adults {{but very}} few juvenile dyrosaurids {{have been found in}} the Oulad Abdoun Basin and Lower Eocene beds. This is indicative of juvenile Dyrosaurids living in freshwater environments whereas large adults live in <b>marine</b> <b>environments.</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>environments</b> are known to have been highly affected by the K-T mass extinction whereas freshwater environments were less affected. Therefore, under the assumption the juveniles lived in freshwater environments and adults lived in <b>marine</b> <b>environments</b> juveniles were able to survive better and the genus could avoid total extinction.|$|R
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into the <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> accumulate in {{the bodies of}} marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a <b>marine</b> <b>environment,</b> sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in {{they do not have}} an immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> for feeding.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.|$|E
5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} South Florida is {{relatively}} and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
5|$|Today, the American Global Positioning System (GPS) enables {{accurate}} navigation worldwide using {{over thirty}} satellites and message timing so exact as to involve general relativity. Ongoing oceanographic research includes marine lifeforms, conservation, the <b>marine</b> <b>environment,</b> {{the chemistry of}} the ocean, the studying and modelling of climate dynamics, the air-sea boundary, weather patterns, ocean resources, renewable energy, waves and currents, and the design and development of new tools and technologies for investigating the deep. Researchers make use of satellite-based remote sensing for surface waters, with research ships, moored observatories and autonomous underwater vehicles to study and monitor {{all parts of the}} sea.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|The Tendaguru {{ecosystem}} primarily {{consisted of}} three types of environment: shallow, lagoon-like marine environments, tidal flats and low coastal environments; and vegetated inland environments. The <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> existed above the fair weather wave base and behind siliciclastic and ooid barriers. It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms. The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes, ponds and pools. These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts. The well vegetated inlands were dominated by conifers. Overall, the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods. During the Early Cretaceous, the Tendaguru became more humid. The Tendaguru Beds {{are similar to the}} Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine interbeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the <b>marine</b> <b>environment.</b> In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the rock underneath the Everglades {{can be explained by}} the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 millionyears ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock. Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 millionyears ago. When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow <b>marine</b> <b>environment</b> in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|E
