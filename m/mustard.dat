40|$|<b>Mustards,</b> {{including}} sulfur <b>mustards</b> {{and nitrogen}} <b>mustards,</b> form {{a class of}} cytotoxic, vesicant chemical warfare agents. <b>Mustards</b> have also been used to treat cancer and played {{a vital role in}} the development of chemotherapy. Additionally, because of their destructive properties, ease of synthesis, and the lack of effective antidotes, <b>mustards</b> are unquestionably terrorist threats. Therefore, quick and convenient detection of <b>mustards</b> is a critical issue. In the present study, we achieved detection of various <b>mustards</b> on the basis of their chemical reactivity by using engineered alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein pores as sensor elements. We describe four classes of reactions for detecting <b>mustards.</b> These reactions occur between <b>mustards</b> and thiol groups contributed by cysteine side-chains within the lumen of the alphaHL pore or on an internal molecular adapter. The approach is quick and straightforward. It can confirm the existence of <b>mustards</b> in as little as 10 min at 50 microM or lower...|$|R

5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition {{often involves}} the initial {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine <b>mustard</b> are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen <b>mustard</b> group.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{determinations}} {{were carried}} out of the relative reaction rates of several nitrogen <b>mustards</b> at various guanine-N 7 positions in DNA fragments of known sequence. The findings suggest structural hypotheses {{of the origins of}} the reaction selectivities. End-labeled DNA fragments were reacted with nitrogen <b>mustards,</b> and the guanine-N 7 alkylation sites were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Relative reaction intensities were determined by computer analysis of digitized densitometer scans. The differences in reaction intensities at different G's were in part attributable to the effects of nearest neighbor base pairs on the molecular electrostatic potential near the reaction site. Uracil and quinacrine <b>mustards</b> have specific sequence preferences for reaction that differ from other <b>mustards.</b> The nature of the specific sequence preferences were determined and hypotheses are proposed to explain their origin...|$|R

5|$|Common herbs such as sage, <b>mustard,</b> {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. <b>Mustard</b> was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} <b>mustard</b> gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of <b>mustard</b> gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E

The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen.
