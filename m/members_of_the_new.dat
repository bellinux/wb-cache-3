5|$|The Hospital Department of {{the army}} was reorganized in 1780, and McKnight was {{promoted}} to Chief Hospital Physician, the highest medical position of the Middle Department. He served there until he left the army in January 1782. According to records, {{he was one of}} the original <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York State Society of the Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} left-wing {{political}} beliefs, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> clubs were not {{accepted into the}} Cyprus Football Association (CFA) and they established a new football federation (the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation, or CAFF) in December 1948. The new federation organized leagues and cups, which attracted thousands of fans. The CAFF matches became more popular {{than those of the}} CFA. Six teams belonged to the CAFF: Nea Salamina in Famagusta, Omonia and Orfeas in Nicosia, Alki at Larnaca, AMOL at Limassol (renamed Antaeus in 1951) and Neos Asteras in Morphou.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of Hastings' outstanding bravery and leadership the award of the Distinguished Service Order was gazetted on 14 January 1916 for distinguished {{service in the}} field on Gallipoli. He was also Mentioned in Despatches on 28 January 1916 in {{recognition of}} his excellent service and appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the President of France. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders: fewer than 100 awards have been made, and Hastings {{was one of only}} 14 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Expeditionary Force to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.|$|E
5|$|Leek {{were chosen}} {{to be among the}} founder <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Northern Premier League Division One in 1987 and in 1989–90 won the Division One title to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier Division, the highest level at which they had ever played. In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the FA Trophy, including a quarter-final win over Darlington, that season's Conference champions, to reach the final at Wembley Stadium but were defeated 3–0 by Barrow.|$|E

5|$|Mike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase {{continue}} to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster {{was one of the}} first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World Order.|$|E
5|$|Some of Nasser's {{liberal and}} Islamist critics in Egypt, {{including}} the founding <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi, dismissed Nasser's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency {{as being the}} product of successful manipulation and demagoguery. Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{was mostly}} routed along {{existing}} rights-of-way, but three commercial properties, including {{a gas station}} and a vacant building, were seized and demolished {{to make way for}} the AirTrain alignment. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City Planning Commission approved the condemnation of several buildings along the route in May 1999, but voiced concerns about the logistics of the project. The commission's concerns included the projected high price of the tickets; ridership demand; and unwieldy transfers at Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|The Victoria Cross for New Zealand (VC) is a {{military}} decoration awarded for valour or gallantry {{in the presence of}} the enemy to <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Armed Forces. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the Governor-General of New Zealand during an investiture held at Government House, Wellington. As the highest award for gallantry in New Zealand it takes precedence over all other postnominals and medals.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} Houston's arrival on March 11, Andres Barcenas and Anselmo Bergaras arrived with {{news that the}} Alamo had fallen and all Texians were slain. Hoping to halt a panic, Houston arrested the men as enemy spies. They were {{released}} hours later when Susannah Dickinson and Joe reached Gonzales and confirmed the report. Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians {{in the area to}} evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat. This sparked a mass exodus, known as the Runaway Scrape, and most Texians, including <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> government, fled east.|$|E
5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014. Kass {{has also been}} a New York City Police Department {{chaplain}} for over 40 years, and had previously served as a United States Air Force chaplain for two years. At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous Frank Serpico, had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that {{led to the formation of}} the Knapp Commission. In 2014, Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E

5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|Hastings was commemorated on {{the stone}} laid below the Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Railways Department. The {{memorial}} was {{the focal point of}} the first public Anzac Day remembrance ceremony in New Zealand on 25 April 1916, which was attended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, William Massey, and other members of Parliament. Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key motivation in the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, Hamilton {{served as}} assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and {{was chosen as}} a {{delegate}} for the Constitutional Convention by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler. Even though Hamilton had {{been a leader in}} calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited. Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing, Jr. and Robert Yates, and both of them opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there were no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation.|$|E
