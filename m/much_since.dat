5|$|We all {{holed up}} in (producer) David Bianco's lovely studio, which {{was built in the}} '70s and hasn't changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> then—and though it was the sticky, hot LA summer outside, inside, it was snowy, {{delightful}} Christmastime. We.. everything together around an invisible campfire; everyone picking up different instruments and playing them on a moment's notice. There was definitely some holiday magic in the air that week.|$|E

5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in their {{assessment of the}} games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> previous generations, and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations. However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E

5|$|Under Diocletian, {{the number}} of legions, and {{probably}} of other units, more than doubled. But {{it is unlikely that}} overall army size increased nearly as <b>much,</b> <b>since</b> unit strengths appear to have been reduced, in some cases drastically e.g. new legions raised by Diocletian appear to have numbered just 1,000 men, compared to the establishment of c. 5,500 in the Principate i.e. the new legions may have increased overall legionary numbers by only c. 15%. Even so, scholars generally agree that Diocletian increased army numbers substantially, by at least 33%.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} gameplay and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little had changed since the release of Fire Emblem, saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E

25|$|By 1990, FEA-United and FTP-NEA {{were talking}} merger. Despite 15 years of competition, neither union had {{achieved}} {{an overwhelming majority}} among the state's teachers. Worse, the problems confronting the state's schools had not improved <b>much</b> <b>since</b> the mid-1970s. With state politics trending more and more conservative, both unions felt merger would be advantageous. But continuing conflict between the two unions kept merger talks from progressing very far.|$|E
25|$|A {{shopping}} centre (including a new central library) {{was built to}} the east and north-east of the market cross and opened in 1986.

However, Windows NT and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but were not initially designed with Internet security in mind as <b>much,</b> <b>since,</b> when it was first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent.|$|E

25|$|Opiliones (formerly Phalangida, {{and better}} known as harvestmen or daddy longlegs) are arachnids that are {{harmless}} to people and {{are known for their}} exceptionally long walking legs, compared to their body size. , over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide. The order Opiliones is divided into five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently described Tetrophthalmi. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 410-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland and 305-million-year-old rocks from France; they look surprisingly modern, suggesting that the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> then.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{clothing}} and embroidery can be most easily {{found in the}} La Huasteca area, where elaborately decorated women's blouses can be seen, especially in the El Higo and Tlalixcoyan area. In Totonacalpan, men are still often seen in white shirts and pants with a bag to hold personal items. This dress {{dates back to the}} early colonial period and had not changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> then. Other areas specialize in wool items such as Naranjos de Amatlán, Minatilán and the city of Veracruz where items such as dresses, skirts and jackets. These and other textils such as tablecloths and napkins are often decorated with cross-stitch. Leather items include shoes, jackets, bags, wallets, belts and boots and are usually made in the La Huasteca region, Teocolo, Citlaltépetl and Naolinco.|$|E
25|$|The game is not {{a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an unofficial pseudo-sequel which changes {{the end of the}} film so that Tony Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami. The game features Al Pacino's likeness in the character of Montana, but Pacino does not voice the character, as he and the game's producers felt his voice had changed too <b>much</b> <b>since</b> 1983. Instead, Montana is voiced by André Sogliuzzo, who was personally selected by Pacino himself. Actors from the original film who did voice work for the game include Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia and Al Israel.|$|E

25|$|In Thailand, {{two types}} of edible insects (cricket and palm weevil larvae) are {{commonly}} farmed {{in the north and}} south respectively. Cricket-farming approaches throughout the northeast are similar and breeding techniques have not changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> the technology was introduced 15 years ago. Small-scale cricket farming, involving a small number of breeding tanks, is rarely found today and most of the farms are medium- or large-scale enterprises. Community cooperatives of cricket farmers have been established to disseminate information on technical farming, marketing and business issues, particularly in northeastern and northern Thailand. Cricket farming has developed into a significant animal husbandry sector and is the main source of income for a number of farmers. In 2013, there are approximately 20 000 farms operating 217 529 rearing pens. Total production over the last six years (1996-2011) has averaged around 7 500 tonnes per year.|$|E
25|$|The most {{complete}} anthropological {{study of how}} a Mexican fixed market operates was done by Bronislaw Malinowsky and Julio de la Fuente in the 1930s {{in the city of}} Oaxaca. The study focused on how the central market of the city worked with the rural communities of the surrounding area. It determined that, for the most part, the relationship had not changed <b>much</b> <b>since</b> before the Conquest in both its economic and social structure. In many areas, local markets, with the abundance of colors, odors, flavors and meanings, represent a synthesis of culture and history of a region, especially that related to commerce that community has with others, according to Amalia Attolina, ethnohistorian at the INAH. In many areas of the country, these traditional markets still constitute a meeting area and a form of social cohesion. Another indication of the market’s cultural continuity is the presence of shrines in almost all traditional markets. In Aztec times, these were to deities such as those related to commerce. Today, most are dedicated to the Virgin Mary or Christ.|$|E
