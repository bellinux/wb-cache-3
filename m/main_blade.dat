One pull opened the <b>main</b> <b>blade,</b> and then old Jerry started in to do as Dick had suggested. It was no easy job and {{the body of the}} snake squirmed and whipped in every direction, lashing each on the neck and the cheek. But the head came off at last and then they left the body where it fell, and leaped {{out of the way of}} further danger.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{earliest}} known sharks are cladodont, {{there is some evidence}} that they evolved from a common ancestor with [...] "diplodonts", sharks whose teeth have two larger blades poking out, plus a small middle tine that could have become the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> in cladodont teeth.|$|E
50|$|The spearing {{function}} of the weapon is apparent but not always effective against armor of great protection, and the deflection includes the trapping of opponents' weapons in the space below the <b>main</b> <b>blade,</b> where a twist of the shaft can apply pressure {{from that moment on}} at long range and of pulling mounted opponents from the saddle.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a spetum is for combat. The <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> is long enough to destroy any {{significant}} organ {{in the human body}} with one quick thrust. The blunt backs of the side blades give the spetum a variety of uses such as tripping and knocking aside shields while providing far more strength to the sharpened side and points than is possible with a dual-edged construction.|$|E
5000|$|A {{swashplate}} is {{a device}} that translates input via the helicopter flight controls into motion of the <b>main</b> rotor <b>blades.</b> Because the <b>main</b> rotor <b>blades</b> are spinning, the swashplate is used to transmit three of the pilot's commands from the non-rotating fuselage to the rotating rotor hub and mainblades.|$|R

Three of the five <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> had been sheared off, along with the rear rotor blades. The cabin was badly damaged. The port-side escape windows were missing.|$|R
5000|$|Yari ("spear"): A spear, or spear-like polearm. Yari have various blade forms, from {{a simple}} double edged and flat blade, to a {{triangular}} cross section double edged blade, to those with a symmetric cross-piece (jumonji-yari) or those with an asymmetric cross piece. The <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> is symmetric and straight unlike a naginata, and usually smaller but can be as large or bigger than some naginata blades.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{plane or}} kanna (...) is a plane pulled towards the user rather than pushed {{in the manner}} of western style planes. They are made of hardwood, usually Japanese white or red oak. The {{laminated}} steel and iron blade is stout compared to western planes. Tapered in length and thickness the plane blade is its own wedge as it fits into a correspondingly shaped mortice {{in the body of the}} plane. Thus dispensing the need for a separate wedge to hold the blade in place, as is the case in most other traditional wooden planes. The chip breaker is held in place with a simple nail inserted some distance away from and perpendicular to the axis of the <b>main</b> <b>blade.</b> The chip breaker is not tapered like the <b>main</b> <b>blade,</b> instead it has bent [...] "ears" [...] that bear down on the plane blade. Chip breakers in Japan were introduced relatively recently during the Meiji period. The soles of Japanese planes also have different configurations intended for varying applications. The apparently simple design disguises a great deal of complexity.|$|E
50|$|Some Swiss Army knives feature locking blades {{to prevent}} {{accidental}} closure. Wenger {{was the first}} to offer a ″PackLock″ for the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> on several of their standard 85mm models. Several large Wenger and Victorinox models feature a locking blade secured by a slide lock that is operated with an unlocking-button integrated in the scales. Some Victorinox 111 mm series knives feature a double liner lock that secures the cutting blade and large slotted screwdriver/cap opener/wire stripper combination tool designed towards prying.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} used by warriors of the Indian Rajput clans, and was both a {{stabbing}} and slicing blade. Some haladie had spikes {{on one side of}} the handle in the style of a knuckle duster, while others had a third blade in this position. In some cases the <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> would be serrated.|$|R
5000|$|Panel saws {{can have}} one <b>main</b> saw <b>blade,</b> or a scoring {{along with a}} <b>main</b> saw <b>blade.</b> Scoring is {{used to create a}} groove, {{especially}} in double side laminate before the main saw rips the piece apart, to avoid chipping. The scoring saw rotates in an opposite direction, as the main saw to avoid chipping.|$|R

50|$|A thick {{strip of}} metal running {{transversely}} {{at the junction}} where the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> attaches to the shank is called the stabiliser. The stabiliser can be double, single, or can be absent in some razor models. The first stabiliser is usually very narrow and thicker and runs at the shank-to-blade junction, covering the shank and just spilling over to the shoulder. The second stabiliser can be distinguished since it is considerably wider and narrower, appearing after the first stabiliser and running lower into the shoulder.|$|E
50|$|The {{parts of}} a {{straight}} razor and their function are described as follows:The narrow end of the blade rotates on a pin called the pivot, between two protective pieces called the scales or handle. The upward curved metal end of the narrow part of the blade beyond the pivot is called the tang and acts as a lever to help raise the blade from the handle. One or two fingers resting on the tang also help stabilize the blade while shaving. The narrow support piece between the tang and the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> is called the shank, but this reference is often avoided {{because it can be}} confusing since the shank is also referred to as tang. The shank sometimes features decorations and the stamp of the brand. The top side and the underside of the shank can sometimes exhibit indentations known as fluting, or jimps for a more secure grip. The curved lower part of the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> from the shank to the cutting edge is called the shoulder. The point where the shoulder joins the cutting edge is called the heel. The endpoint of the cutting edge {{at the front of the}} blade, opposite to the heel, is called the toe.|$|E
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of safety-pin spinnerbaits {{is that they}} allow the angler to cover the entire water column. Often, safety-pin style spinnerbaits are retrieved within sight and {{just below the surface}} at a steady rate. Slow-rolling a spinnerbait is similar to the presentation of a skirted jig in that the lure remains in contact with the bottom throughout the retrieve. If fished as a [...] "drop-bait," [...] the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> helicopters above the weighted body and hook as the bait falls, thus simulating a dying minnow. Most times the strike occurs as the horizontal retrieve is resumed.|$|E

50|$|A d'k tahg is a Klingon dagger. The knife {{has three}} blades: a <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> with a cutout in the center, and two smaller blades on either side. In some models, these side blades are {{spring-loaded}} and can pop out into position and close up for storage. In other models, the blades are fixed. It {{also features a}} pommel studded with blunt spikes. The d'k tahg first appeared in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, and appeared occasionally throughout the following films and television series. The knife was designed by Gil Hibben. Although the d'k tahg appeared in Star Trek III, it was not referred to by its name until Star Trek: The Next Generation.|$|E
5000|$|A spetum is a pole {{weapon that}} was used in Europe during the 13th century. It {{consists}} of a pole, some 6-8 feet long, on which is mounted a spear head with two projections at its base. Many variations of this design flourished over time; some feel that the ranseur is a variation of the spetum. Other names include chauve souris, corseca, corsèsque, korseke, runka, and rawcon. The spetum is usually distinguished from the ranseur and partisan by its [...] "prongs" [...] being single edged and used for slashing. The <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> is 12-14 inches long, and the side blades are only about half that length and are set at acute angles.|$|E

Meanwhile, both Kyre and Gorgutz arrive at the altar of the Spear and Kyre quickly bests the Ork Warboss. Kyre takes the Spear for himself and attempts to kill Gorgutz with it. Unfortunately for Kyre, it is revealed the prophecy regarding the Spear was a trap to free the Daemon. The [...] "Spear's" [...] <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> shatters without harming Gorgutz, and Kyre is consumed in a blood sacrifice that releases the Bloodthirster from the ice.

5000|$|Every {{detail of}} the gondola has its own symbolism. The iron prow-head of the gondola, called [...] "fero da prorà" [...] or [...] "dol fin", is needed to balance {{the weight of the}} gondolier at the stern and has an [...] "S" [...] shape {{symbolic}} of the twists in the Canal Grande. Under the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> {{there is a kind of}} comb with six teeth or prongs ("rebbi") pointing forward standing for the six districts or [...] "sestieri" [...] of Venice. A kind of tooth juts out backwards toward the centre of the gondola symbolises the island of Giudecca. The curved top signifies the Doge's cap. The semi-circular break between the curved top and the six teeth is said to represent the Rialto Bridge. Sometimes three friezes can be seen in-between the six prongs, indicating the three main islands of the city: Murano, Burano and Torcello.|$|E
5000|$|... == Description == C. sagittata has {{creeping}} rhizomes {{and eventually}} can form extensive clusters {{of plants that}} may, dependent on location, be up to 30 cm high. The petioles are 7-30 cm long and up to 7 mm wide. The blade of the leaf has a wide arrowhead (sagittate) shape with a retuse or blunt tip, and are between one and four cm long. Each leaf also has two basal lobes which extend as appendages that are about half {{as long as the}} <b>main</b> <b>blade,</b> and are almost free, except for a small bridge along the middle vein of the leaf. These appendages are often approximately at a right angle to the petiole. In some northern forms (sometimes regarded as a separate species, C. alata) however, the appendages are in the same plane as the remainder of the leaf blade. The solitary actinomorphic (radially symmetric) flowers of 3 cm or more across have five to eight spreading, ivory to pallid yellow, petal-like sepals of ½-1½ cm long and 2-8 mm wide, and a faint scent of honey. There are between thirty and seventy five stamens, with broad filaments.|$|E
40|$|In turbochargers {{for diesel}} engines, a high {{pressure}} ratio {{and a wide}} operating range are required to achieve extremely low exhaust emissions. In the present study, the ring groove arrangement was adopted to enhance a operating flow range in a centrifugal compressor for automobile turbochargers. The upstream groove was located at the casing wall of the suction pipe and the downstream groove was located at the shroud casing wall near {{the leading edge of}} the splitter blades, where both grooves were connected by an annular bypass. According to the numerical results by using ANSYS-CFX, it becomes clear that the ring groove arrangement is effective for suppression of separation at the leading-edge of <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> even in small flow rates. The reverse flow zone on the shroud casing is sucked out from downstream groove and the flow incidence at the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> leading edge is reduced successfully by about 5 degrees due to the increased incoming flow rate...|$|E
