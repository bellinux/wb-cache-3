40|$|I {{deal with}} the road bridge in Velké Meziříčí in the thesis. The bridge is a {{reinforced}} concrete structure with one field, with two <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> above the ground level. In the first phase I assess existing state of the ultimate limit state. I do calculation of internal forces both manually and in Scia Engineer. Furthermore, I propose two possible solutions of measures for the <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> to increase the carrying capacity and improving sight conditions on the bridge.

40|$|As for the {{structure}} of bridges in these days, there is some tendency to use the plane-framed structures considering the torsional rigidity of their <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> with thinwall of a box section. However, there arise some cases of designing a skew plane-framed structure to be suitable for {{the conditions of the}} erection site. Formerly H. Homberg obtained ingeniously the solutions of the plane-framed structures using the group-load （Lastgruppen） method. In this study, this group-load method is applied to the analysis of a skew plane-framed structure considering the torsional rigidity of its <b>main</b>　<b>beams,</b> and the influence lines of the bending moments as well as the torsional ones are obtained by a digital computer. The results are as follows : (1) This analysis indicates considerably smaller values of the bending moments than hose without the torsional rigidity. (2) The position of the maximum bending moment is not always at the midspan of <b>main</b> <b>beams.</b> It is affected by the skew angle, the panel length, the spacing of <b>main</b> <b>beams,</b> and other factors...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{method is}} presented for determining an excitation of an arbitrary (but fixed) planar source configuration. The desired radiation pattern is specified over {{all or part}} of the visible region. It may have multiple and/or shaped <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> with low sidelobes. The iterative sampling method is used to find an excitation of the source which yields a radiation pattern that approximates the desired pattern to within a specified tolerance. In this paper the method is used to calculate excitations for line sources, linear arrays (equally and unequally spaced), rectangular apertures, rectangular arrays (arbitrary spacing grid), and circular apertures. Examples using these sources to form patterns with shaped <b>main</b> <b>beams,</b> multiple <b>main</b> <b>beams,</b> shaped sidelobe levels, and combinations thereof are given...|$|R
25|$|Shrouded dish– Sometimes a {{cylindrical}} metal shield {{is attached}} to the rim of the dish. The shroud shields the antenna from radiation from angles outside the <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> axis, reducing the sidelobes. It is sometimes used to prevent interference in terrestrial microwave links, where several antennas using the same frequency are located close together. The shroud is coated inside with microwave absorbent material. Shrouds can reduce back lobe radiation by 10dB.|$|E
25|$|The probe {{included}} two small deep space transponders for communications with the Deep Space Network and {{three kinds of}} antennas: a high gain phased array whose <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> could be electronically steered in one plane, a medium-gain “fan-beam” antenna and a low gain horn with a broad pattern. The high gain antenna was used as transmit-only at 8.4GHz, the medium-gain and low gain antennas transmit at 8.4GHz and receive at 7.2GHz, and all three antennas operate with right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation. One {{of each of these}} antennas was mounted {{on the front of the}} probe facing the Sun, and one of each was mounted to the back of the probe facing away from the Sun.|$|E
25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E

2500|$|All {{aircraft}} in the UH-1 family have similar construction. [...] The UH-1H is the most-produced version, and is representative of all types. The main structure consists of two longitudinal <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> that run under the passenger cabin to the nose {{and back to the}} tail boom attachment point. The <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> are separated by transverse bulkheads and provide the supporting structure for the cabin, landing gear, under-floor fuel tanks, transmission, engine and tail boom. The <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> are joined at the lift beam, a short aluminum girder structure that is attached to the transmission via a lift link on the top and the cargo hook on the bottom and is located at the aircraft's center of gravity. The lift beams were changed to steel later in the UH-1H's life, due to cracking on high-time airframes. The semi-monocoque tail boom attaches to the fuselage with four bolts.|$|R

The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> which was repairable. A replacement <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. [...] The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows.

New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the [...] thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft.|$|E

2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines microwave network. [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E

[8] The First Part {{was written}} in Bedford jail; this is 'about a mile off the place,' at the village of Elstow, where Mr. Bunyan resided, and where his house is still standing--a very humble cottage, and an object of curiosity, as is also the very ancient church and tower. The tower answers to the {{description}} of the 'steeple-house' in which Mr. Bunyan was engaged in ringing the bells. 'The <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> that lay overthwart the steeple from side to side,' and under which he stood lest 'one of the bells should fall and kill him,' presents exactly that appearance---(Ivimey).|$|E

Now {{you must}} know, that, before this, I had taken much delight in ringing, but my {{conscience}} {{beginning to be}} tender, I thought such practice was but vain, and therefore forced myself to leave it; yet my mind hankered; wherefore I {{would go to the}} steeple- house, and look on, though I durst not ring: but I thought this did not become religion neither; yet I forced myself, and would look on still, but quickly after, I began to think, how if one of the bells should fall? Then I chose to stand under a <b>main</b> <b>beam,</b> that lay overthwart the steeple, from side to side, thinking here I might stand sure; but then I should think again, should the bell fall with a swing, it might first hit the wall, and then, rebounding upon me, might kill me for all this beam; this made me stand in the steeple-door; and now, thought I, I am safe enough; for if the bell should now fall, I can slip out behind these thick walls, and so be preserved notwithstanding.|$|E
6000|$|... § XII. I wish, however, {{at present}} {{to fix the}} reader's {{attention}} on {{the form of the}} bracket itself; a most important feature in modern as well as ancient architecture. The first idea of a bracket is that of a long stone or piece of timber projecting from the wall, as a, Fig. XXXIX., of which the strength depends on the toughness of the stone or wood, and the stability on the weight of wall above it (unless it be the end of a <b>main</b> <b>beam).</b> But let it be supposed that the structure at a, being of the required projection, is found too weak: then we may strengthen it in one of three ways; (1) by putting a second or third stone beneath it, as at b; (2) by giving it a spur, as at c; (3) by giving it a shaft and another bracket below, d; the great use of this arrangement being that the lowermost bracket has the help of the weight of the shaft-length of wall above its insertion, which is, of course, greater than the weight of the small shaft: and then the lower bracket may be farther helped by the structure at b or c.|$|E
