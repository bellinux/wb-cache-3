50|$|Seton Hutchison's {{exploits}} {{made him}} a well-known figure and he was awarded both the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross.

50|$|However, the {{simplicity}} of MyISAM has several drawbacks. The <b>major</b> <b>deficiency</b> of MyISAM {{is the absence of}} transactions support. Also, foreign keys are not supported. In normal use cases, InnoDB seems to be faster than MyISAM.|$|R
50|$|The <b>major</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{turned out}} to be the phone's case design, which was weak enough to allow the device to break into two parts with little effort. For many users, this fault would not {{manifest}} itself until after extensive use.|$|R
40|$|Fully-connected mesh {{networks}} that can potentially {{be employed in}} a range of applications, are inherently associated with <b>major</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in interference management and network capacity improvement. The tree-connected (routing based) mesh networks used in today’s applications have <b>major</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in routing delays and reconfiguration delays in the implementation stage. This paper introduces a CDMA based fully-connected mesh network, which controls the transmission powers of the nodes {{in order to ensure that}} the communication channels remain interference-free and minimizes the energy consumption. Moreover, the bounds for the number of nodes and the spatial configuration are provided to ensures that the communication link satisfies the QoS (Quality of Service) requirements at all times. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{urgency of}} the problem in the former USSR and Eastern Europe was {{highlighted}} by the serious accident at the Chernobyl Unit 4 nuclear-power plant in 1986. <b>Major</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in design and poor safety management practices led to catastrophic releases of radioactive material. Large areas have been contaminated around the site, but also far away. More than 60, 000 people had to be evacuated initially. Since then more than 200, 000 people have been removed from their homes due to contamination by long-lived radio-isotopes like Caesium. Areas encompassing more than 3, 000 square kilometres will remain uninhabitable for decades to come. The emergency response to the Chernobyl accident suffered from <b>major</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> some of which became known only years later: local, regional, and central decision-making failed in important tasks.

30|$|Piezoelectric {{actuators}} (PEAs) {{have been}} widely used in micro- and nanopositioning applications due to their fine resolution, rapid responses, and large actuating forces.
