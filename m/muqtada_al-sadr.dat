25|$|On April 6, 2008, the Iraqi National Security Council {{released}} a statement calling on all political parties to disband their militias {{if they want to}} participate in the elections later in the year. The statement was seen to be directed at <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr,</b> who derives most of his support from Sadr City.|$|E
25|$|Nassar al-Rubaie, an {{official}} in al-Sadr's political movement, accused the Iraqi government of trying to weaken the Sadr trend ahead of provincial elections. In response to the fighting the political movement of powerful Shiite cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> launched a nationwide civil disobedience campaign across Iraq to protest the raids and detentions against the Mahdi Army.|$|E
25|$|Militia leader <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> {{used his}} grass-roots {{organization}} and Mahdi Militia of {{over a thousand}} armed men {{to take control of}} the streets of Baghdad. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) soon realized it had lost control and closed down his popular newspaper. This resulted in mass anti-American demonstrations. The CPA then attempted to arrest al-Sadr on murder charges. He defied the American military by taking refuge in the Holy City of Najaf.|$|E
5000|$|Ahmed al-Sadr, (born in 1986 in Najaf), Muqtada's nephew - {{the son of}} <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> brother Mustafa al-Sadr.|$|R
50|$|Abu Azrael was {{a former}} militia member in <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Mahdi Army which fought against the United States during the U.S.-led {{invasion}} of Iraq.|$|R
25|$|Qais al-Khazali {{split from}} <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Mahdi Army after the Shi'a {{uprising}} in 2004 {{to create his}} own Khazali network. When the Mahdi Army signed a cease-fire {{with the government and}} the Americans and the fighting stopped, Qais al-Khazali continued fighting, and during the battle Khazali was already issuing his own orders to militiamen without <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> approval. The group's leadership (which includes Qais Khazali, Abd al-Hadi al-Darraji (a politician in <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Sadr Movement) and Akram al-Kaabi), however, reconciled with al-Sadr in mid-2005. In July 2006, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq was founded and became one of the Special Groups which operated more independently {{from the rest of the}} Mahdi Army. It became a completely independent organisation after the Mahdi Army's disbanding after the 2008 Shi'a uprising. In November 2008 when Sadr created the Promised Day Brigade to succeed the Mahdi Army, he asked AAH (and other Special Groups) to join, but they declined.|$|R
25|$|On May 11, a {{cease-fire}} {{went into effect}} and on May 12 a 14-point agreement was signed between the Iraqi government and representatives of <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr,</b> granting Iraqi military forces permission by the Mahdi Army to enter the district to establish security checkpoints and to hunt for rogue militiamen. Under the agreement, the U.S. military would not enter areas of Sadr City north of al-Quds street, but the Mahdi Army promised to stop rocket attacks on U.S. military bases and the Green Zone.|$|E
25|$|On March 31 {{the curfew}} {{announced}} by the Iraqi prime minister was lifted {{in most parts of}} the Baghdad following another unilateral ceasefire called by <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr.</b> However the curfew remained in effect in Sadr City into April and the ceasefire only lasted until April 6, when US forces, for the first time, started a push into Sadr City, trying to hold the ground gained in an attempt to get the militia mortar teams further away from the Green Zone. The U.S. and Iraqi units were coming under heavy fire as they moved deeper into the neighborhood, engaging anyone that faced them.|$|E
25|$|In early August, 2004, Sistani {{experienced}} {{serious health}} complications {{related to a}} previously diagnosed heart condition. He traveled to London to receive medical treatment. It was, reportedly, {{the first time that}} Sistani had left Iraq in decades, and may have been due, in part, to growing concerns for his safety from sectarian violence. Though still recovering, Sistani returned later in the month to broker a military truce at the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf where <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> and the Mahdi Army had been cornered by American and Iraqi forces. Sadr, who rose rapidly to prominence through a series of independent military actions beginning in 2004, has since actively challenged Sistani's more progressive influence over Shia in the region.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{previous}} operations {{which focused on}} Sunni extremists and ISI, Marne Anvil targeted Shia extremists linked with <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) located east of Baghdad. It was succeeded by Operation Marne Courageous in November.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{military}} attributed {{a decline}} in reported civilian deaths to several factors including the U.S.‑led [...] "troop surge", the growth of U.S.-funded Awakening Councils, and Shiite cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.|$|R
50|$|This violent {{break between}} <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Mahdi Army and the rival Badr Organization of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, {{seen in the}} {{fighting}} {{in the town of}} Amarah on October 20, 2006, would severely complicate the efforts of Iraqi and US officials to quell the soaring violence.|$|R
25|$|The Allawi government, with {{significant}} numbers of holdovers from the Coalition Provisional Authority, began to engage in attempts to secure control of the oil infrastructure, the source of Iraq's foreign currency, {{and control of the}} major cities of Iraq. The continuing insurgencies, poor state of the Iraqi Army, disorganized condition of police and security forces, as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control. In addition, both former Ba'athist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The Allawi government vowed to crush resistance, using U.S. troops, {{but at the same time}} negotiated with <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi {{government}} {{released an}} official videotape of his execution, showing him being {{led to the}} gallows, and ending after his head was in the hangman's noose. International public controversy arose when a mobile phone recording of the hanging showed him surrounded by a contingent of his countrymen who jeered him in Arabic and praised the Shia cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr,</b> and his subsequent fall through the trap door of the gallows. The atmosphere of the execution drew criticism around the world from nations that oppose as well as support capital punishment. On Sunday 31 December 2006, Saddam Hussein's body was returned to his birthplace of Al-Awja, near Tikrit, and was buried near the graves of other family members.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a ceasefire}} {{negotiated}} in Iran on 31 March, <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> withdrew his fighters from the streets, but had gained {{a major political}} victory. However, the Iraqi Army, reinforced with brigades {{from other parts of}} Iraq, including the 1st Division from al-Anbar, continued to carry out slower, more deliberate clearing operations in militia strongholds. The Hillah Special Weapons and Tactics Unit, as well as Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF), carried out a number of targeted raids on militia leaders. By 20 April, the Iraqi army had taken control of the last major district controlled by the Mahdi Army and by 24 April, Iraqi forces claimed to be in full control of the city centre.|$|E
50|$|Abu Deraa {{operated}} out of Sadr City, {{which is}} also the stronghold of Shiite cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> militia, the Mahdi Army. He has gained a reputation for his command of Shiite death squads and brutal attacks targeting Sunni Muslims and cases of mass kidnappings in broad daylight.|$|R
25|$|On March 28, the US {{overseer}} of Iraq, Paul Bremer, {{ordered the}} 60-day closure of Al-Hawza, a newspaper published by <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr’s</b> group, on {{the charges of}} inciting violence against the occupation. The next day thousands of Iraqis rallied outside the offices of Al-Hawza {{in support of the}} newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{negotiations}} {{that followed the}} fighting between <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> militia and joint US/Iraqi forces in Najaf ended when Allawi withdrew his emissary Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie on August 14. An al-Sadr spokesman alleged that they [...] "had agreed with Rubaie on all points but Allawi called him back and he ended the issue." ...|$|R
25|$|According to Juan Cole, three Iraqi clerics all {{employed}} {{their influence}} and authority among the Shiite {{rank and file}} to make the Samarra bombing work for them politically. Sistani expanded his militia and stayed {{at the forefront of}} the movement by encouraging peaceful rallies. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim used the explosion in Samarra to bolster his own authority. He remonstrated with the American ambassador, saying it was not reasonable to expect the religious Shiites, who won the largest bloc of seats in parliament, to give up their claim on the ministry of interior, and that, indeed, Khalilzad had helped provoke the troubles with his assertions to that effect earlier. <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> used the incident to push for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, something he has wanted since the fall of Saddam. Abroad, Supreme Jurisprudent Khamenei blamed Bush and his Israeli allies, an allegation widely believed to be true in Iraq.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the return}} of {{sovereignty}} to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June, the insurgency was still viewed by many Iraqis as legitimate and the Iraqi government as agents of the United States. In late 2004, a CIA officer said that insurgents in Ramadi were receiving financing via Syria [...] "to the tune of $1.2 million a month". The insurgency continued to enjoy broad-based support throughout Iraqi society, showing few of the sectarian divisions which would become pronounced following the 2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing. Shia Iraqis attacked Iraqi military units moving towards Fallujah, Shia leaders called on their supporters to donate blood for insurgents, and <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> referred to the insurgents in Fallujah as [...] "holy warriors". Some Shi'ia attempted to join the fighting.|$|E
500|$|Prior to November, Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi invited {{representatives from}} Ramadi and Fallujah {{in an attempt}} to {{negotiate}} an end to the fighting, similar to his previous dealings with Shia leader <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr.</b> In September, with the blessings of the Americans, Allawi disbanded the discredited Fallujah Brigade and privately gave the Marines permission to begin planning an offensive to retake Fallujah. In early October, Allawi stepped up his efforts, demanding that the representatives of Fallujah hand over Zarqawi or face a renewed assault. They refused. Shortly before the Marine offensive began, Sheikh Harith al-Dhari, leader of the pro-insurgent Association of Muslim Scholars, said that [...] "the Iraqi people view Fallujah as the symbol of their steadfastness, resistance and pride." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) and Hillah SWAT units, {{with which}} we were {{embedded}} in December, killed or captured more than 200 [...] "high profile criminals" [...] for which they had arrest warrants. Most of those apprehended or killed were renegade members of <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Jaish al Mahdi — the Mahdi Army.|$|R
50|$|Interrogation {{of members}} from the Asaib Ahl al Haq network {{revealed}} that the group had received substantial Iran-based training in explosives technology; arms and munitions; and some cases of advice. All this is alleged by the U.S. military {{to have taken place}} through the Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. It is also alleged that Iran supports <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> Mahdi Army.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2008, <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> {{followers}} renewed {{a ceasefire}} {{which had been}} declared in August 2007, under which they pledged not to attack rival armed groups or American forces in Iraq. General Qassem Suleimani of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) ordered this truce. The truce, however, came under strain {{in the weeks before}} the battle as Iraqi forces detained [...] "rogue" [...] militia members.|$|R
2500|$|On December 24, 2006, {{political}} violence between Shiite militias hit Samawah, [...] killing 9 people, among them 4 policemen. Reportedly, local {{members of the}} Mahdi Army tried to seize the city in a failed attempt and clashed with the police, who were aided by the Badr Organization. Internal fighting and division among the local tribes was reported. Associates of Mahdi leader <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> said he was distancing himself from the Samawah militia, led by [...] "a renegade cleric".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> {{condemned}} {{the attack and}} called for calm. Having called to stop mutual attacks, Sadr ordered members of his militia to protect Sunni mosques in majority Shia areas in southern Iraq. He called for Iraqi unity and warned against [...] "a plan by the occupation to spark a sectarian war". He called on Sunni {{groups such as the}} Association of Muslim Scholars to form a joint panel and ordered his militia to defend Shiite holy sites across Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Following the leaking of {{a mobile}} phone footage of Saddam Hussein's execution, {{along with the}} {{detention}} on 3 January 2007, of a guard under the Justice Ministry headed by a Sunni Iraqi minister Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli, suspicions have arisen that the ministry may have intended to inflame sectarian tensions. In an interview with La República on 19 January 2007, <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> said {{that the people who}} were in the room during execution were [...] "people paid to discredit him" [...] and the purpose of the unofficial video was to [...] "make Muqtadá look like the real enemy of the Sunnis." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Religious Opinions {{column of}} Al-Sadr online is the {{official}} medium for broadcasting <b>Muqtada</b> <b>Al-Sadr's</b> controversial fatwa-like rulings on religious, social, and political issues. Al-Sadr has attained the clerical position of Hojatoleslam, which does not qualify him to render religious opinions (perform Ijtihad) as would an Ayatollah in the traditions of Shia Islamic jurisprudence. Al-Sadr has asserted wide latitude to interpret the previous rulings of his father, Muhammad Muhammad Sadeq Al-Sadr and relate them to contemporary issues. Despite the opposition of many Shia institutions, <b>Muqtada</b> <b>Al-Sadr's</b> rulings are widely accepted by his youthful following. The rulings, which are generally initiated by queries from Al-Sadr followers, provide religious justification for resistance against United States forces in Iraq as well as purging Ba'athist elements from the government. [...] The rulings also clarify Al-Sadr's positions with respect to {{his support for the}} State of Law Coalition led by Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki. Since 2010, Al-Sadr has taken on social and cultural issues more frequently, with statements advocating restrictions on mixing of genders and prohibition of alcohol among those posted by Al-Sadr Online.|$|R
50|$|On March 28, the U.S. {{overseer}} of Iraq, Paul Bremer, {{ordered the}} 60-day closure of Al-Hawza, a newspaper published by <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr’s</b> group, on {{the charges of}} inciting violence against the occupation. The next day thousands of Iraqis rallied outside the offices of Al-Hawza {{in support of the}} newspaper. The decision was made to use 984th MP CO to shut down the newspaper based on information provided by the 148th MP Team (MPI/PIO).|$|R
50|$|Many of the resettled Marsh Arabs {{have gained}} {{representation}} through the Hezbollah Movement in Iraq; others have become followers of <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> movement, {{through which they}} gained political control of Maysan Governorate. Political instability and local feuds, aggravated by the poverty of the dispossessed Marsh Arab population, remain a serious problem. Rory Stewart observed that throughout history, the Maʻdān were the pawn of many rulers and became expert dissimulators. The tribal chiefs are outwardly submissive {{and work with the}} coalition and Iraqi officials. Behind the scenes, the tribes engage in smuggling and other activities.|$|R
2500|$|Operation Charge of the Knights {{led to the}} Battle of Basra {{which lasted}} from 25 to 31 March. [...] Although the lack of {{planning}} resulted in some confusion, the Coalition did support the Iraqi action with land and air assets. [...] By the end of March the Iraqi Government forces had negotiated a ceasefire with <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr.</b> [...] With the militias melting away, Iraqi Government forces were able to claim control of Basra. [...] While recognizing that Operation Charge of the Knights had been far from perfect, Stirrup judged {{it to be a}} success as the Iraqis were taking responsibility for their own security.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 March, the Iraqi prime {{minister}} Nouri al-Maliki {{met with the}} commander of US forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus. During the meeting, al-Maliki explained that the impending operation would be an [...] "entirely Iraqi affair...to take on criminals and gang leaders" [...] in Basra. General Petraeus advised al-Maliki not to rush into a fight and that the large scale movement of Iraqi forces would put strains on the Iraqi logistical and command and control networks, as well as [...] "putting at risk" [...] {{a lot of the}} gains made {{since the start of the}} US [...] "Surge" [...] in 2007 by threatening the ceasefire imposed on the Mahdi Army by <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr</b> {{called the}} {{departure}} the first expulsion of U.S.-led coalition forces from an Iraqi urban center. A message from al-Sadr's office that played on car-mounted speakers throughout Amarah exclaimed [...] "This {{is the first}} Iraqi city that has kicked out the occupier...We have to celebrate this occasion!" [...] A crowd {{of as many as}} 5,000 people, including hundreds armed with AK-47 assault rifles, ransacked Camp Abu Naji immediately after the last British soldier had departed despite the presence of a 450-member Iraqi army brigade meant to guard the base. The looting, which lasted from about 10am to early evening, turned violent at about noon when individuals in the mob shot at the base.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2004, {{coalition}} forces closed Shiite cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> newspaper al-Hawza, claiming it contained incitements to violence. One example provided was that on 26 February, an article claimed that {{a suicide bombing}} in Iskandariya that killed 53 people was a rocket fired by the Americans, and not a car bomb. In response, al-Sadr launched a day of protests. During these protests, members of the Iraqi insurgency (who {{may or may not}} have been tied to al-Sadr) ambushed a Coalition patrol guarding a trash collecting unit in Sadr-City resulting in the deaths of 8 soldiers. Several dozen of al-Sadr's followers were killed during these protests.|$|R
5000|$|... 6 April: The Iraqi Political Council for National Security, {{with representatives}} from all major {{political}} parties holds a meeting and agrees unanimously to a resolution {{with a number of}} points and actions necessary to [...] "end the existence of this gang" [...] (the Mahdi Army). Among those points is a decision that the Sadr trend will {{not have the right to}} participate in the political process or take part in the provincial elections unless they disband the Mahdi army. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki continues to deny that any concessions were made or that Iran was involved in negotiating <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr's</b> cease-fire order on 30 March 2008.|$|R
50|$|Al-Naqib {{sought to}} provide the MOI with {{effective}} Iraqi constabulary forces after the poor performance of the police in battles against Shiite cleric <b>Muqtada</b> <b>al-Sadr’s</b> Mahdi Army. Al-Naqib created “commando units” of former soldiers from elite units such as Saddam’s Republican Guard.These units, commanded by al-Naqib’s uncle, Adnan Thabit, a former army general, were personally loyal to the minister. The commandos were raised initially without U.S. involvement, were under MOI control, and were outside the U.S. Civilian Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT) assistance program. The U.S. military provided arms and logistical support to these units, which proved effective under Minister al-Naqib’s stewardship in fighting alongside U.S. forces against Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias.|$|R
