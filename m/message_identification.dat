40|$|<b>Message</b> <b>identification</b> (M-I) {{divergence}} is {{an important}} measure of the information distance between probability distributions, similar to Kullback-Leibler (K-L) and Renyi divergence. In fact, M-I divergence with a variable parameter can make an effect on characterization of distinction between two distributions. Furthermore, by choosing an appropriate parameter of M-I divergence, {{it is possible to}} amplify the information distance between adjacent distributions while maintaining enough gap between two nonadjacent ones. Therefore, M-I divergence can {{play a vital role in}} distinguishing distributions more clearly. In this paper, we first define a parametric M-I divergence in the view of information theory and then present its major properties. In addition, we design a M-I divergence estimation algorithm by means of the ensemble estimator of the proposed weight kernel estimators, which can improve the convergence of mean squared error from O(^-j/d) to O(^- 1) (j∈ (0,d]).

40|$|We discuss {{concepts}} of <b>message</b> <b>identification</b> {{in the sense}} of Ahlswede and Dueck via general quantum channels, extending investigations for classical channels, initial work for classical-quantum (cq) channels and "quantum fingerprinting". We show that the identification capacity of a discrete memoryless quantum channel for classical information can be larger than that for transmission; this is in contrast to all previously considered models (including so-called "simultaneous" identification), where it turns out to equal the common randomness capacity (equals transmission capacity in our case) : in particular, for a noiseless qubit, we show the identification capacity to be 2, while transmission and common randomness capacity are 1. This is an effect connected to state space geometry rather than dense coding as demonstrated by quantum-classical (qc) channels whose identification capacity equals their transmission capacity but which typically have larger entanglement-assisted capacities. Then we turn to a natural concept of identification of quantum messages (i. e. a notion of "fingerprint" for quantum states). This is much closer to quantum information transmission than its classical counterpart (for one thing, the code length grows only exponentially, compared to double exponentially for classical identification). Indeed, we show how the problem exhibits a nice connection to visible quantum coding. Astonishingly, for the noiseless qubit channel this capacity turns out to be 2 : in other words, one can compress two qubits into one and this is optimal. In general however, we conjecture quantum identification capacity to be different from classical identification capacity...|$|E

Hence, {{it is necessary to}} combine WS-Security processing and DoS protection. In this paper, we present our solution for WS-SecurityPolicybased policy decision within Web Service Firewalls.
