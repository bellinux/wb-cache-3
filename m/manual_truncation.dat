40|$|Quantification of {{myocardial}} {{and liver}} iron load {{has become a}} mainstay of guiding therapy in thalassaemia patients. However, current quantification methods are user dependent for data-point exclusion before curve fitting, and do not report the T 2 * certainty. Recently, an automatic inline maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) method with k-space Rician noise correction was validated against the reference standard <b>manual</b> <b>truncation</b> method. We now present a vendor-independent offline tool for fully automatic post processing and T 2 * quantification with certainty estimates, tested in computer simulations and patients with iron overload...|$|E
40|$|Background Myocardial iron {{overload}} assessment by multislice multiecho T 2 * {{technique is}} used in the clinical management of thalassemia major (TM) patients. Signal decay curves are extracted from the 16 left ventricular (LV) segments and the fitting of these curves to a mono-exponential model provides the corresponding T 2 * values. In patients with severe cardiac iron overload, where signal will decay quickly becoming comparable to image noise, <b>manual</b> <b>truncation</b> of signal decay curves excluding later echo times (TEs) is adopted. In this study an automatic truncation method avoiding the variability associated with the manual selection of the truncation point is introduced and validated. Go to: Methods Twenty patients (13 males, age 33 Â± 7 years) enrolled in the MIOT Network and diagnosed for severe iron overload (T 2 * 5...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis covers construction, application and evaluation of a stemming algorithm for advanced information searching and retrieval in Latvian databases. Its aim {{is to examine the}} following two questions: Is it possible to apply for Latvian a suffix removal algorithm originally designed for English? Can stemming in Latvian produce the same or better information retrieval results than <b>manual</b> <b>truncation?</b> In order to achieve these aims, the role and importance of automatic word conflation both for document indexing and information retrieval are characterised. A review of literature, which analyzes and evaluates different types of stemming techniques and retrospective development of stemming algorithms, justifies the necessity to apply this advanced IR method also for Latvian. Comparative analysis of morphological structure both for English and Latvian language determined the selection of Porter's suffix removal algorithm as a basis for the Latvian sternmer. An extensive list of Latvian stopwords including conjunctions, particles and adverbs, was designed and added to the initial sternmer in order to eliminate insignificant words from further processing. A number of specific modifications and changes related to the Latvian language were carried out to the structure and rules of the original stemming algorithm. Analysis of word stemming based on Latvian electronic dictionary and Latvian text fragments confirmed that the suffix removal technique can be successfully applied also to Latvian language. An evaluation study of user search statements revealed that the stemming algorithm to a certain extent can improve effectiveness of information retrieval...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of natural-language text databases {{is that a}} user {{must be able to}} specify all of the variant forms of each query word if high recall is to be achieved. The most common type of word variants are those arising from morphology and thus most retrieval systems provide facilities for user-controlled right-hand (and occasionally left-hand) truncation to allow the retrieval of all words with the same root. A stemming algorithm, or stemmer, is a computational procedure that reduces all words with the same root to a single form by stripping the root of its derivational and inflectional affixes. In most cases, only suffixes are stripped so that a stemmer provides an automatic equivalent of <b>manual,</b> right-hand <b>truncation.</b> Thus far, most work on stemmers has focused on present-day languages, but the increasing user of computers in the humanities has resulted in a need for comparable tools to facilitate searching in historical text databases. This paper summarises some of the initial results of a project here in Sheffield to develop such tools for databases of Latin text...|$|R
