We document that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> both degrees take less risk, follow less extreme investment styles, and achieve less extreme performance outcomes. Our results are consistent with the explanation that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> a certain personal attitude that makes them take less risk and invest more conventionally choose to gather both qualifications. We rule out several alternative explanations: our results are not driven by the respective contents of the MBA and the CFA program, by the manager's skill, or by the fund family's investment policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} managers 2 ̆ 7 equity incentives—arising from stock-based compensation and stock ownership—and earnings management. We hypothesize that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> high equity incentives {{are more likely to}} sell shares in the future and this motivates these managers to engage in earnings management to increase the value of the shares to be sold. Using stock-based compensation and stock ownership data over the 1993 – 2000 time period, we document that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> high equity incentives sell more shares in subsequent periods. As expected, we find that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> high equity incentives are more likely to report earnings that meet or just beat analysts 2 ̆ 7 forecasts. We also find that <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> consistently high equity incentives are less likely to report large positive earnings surprises. This finding is consistent with the wealth of thesemanagers being more sensitive to future stock performance, which leads to increased reserving of current earnings to avoid future earningsdisappointments. Collectively, our results indicate that equity incentives lead to incentives for earnings management...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether stereotypes {{associated with}} a person’s name affect the investment choices of mutual fund investors. Our key conjecture is that funds would have lower inflows and greater flow-performance sensitivity when fund managers have foreign-sounding names. Consistent with our conjecture, we find that perceived foreignness of fund managers’ names influence fund flows even though <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> foreign-sounding names do not follow unique investment styles or have inferior investment skill. Specifically, fund <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> foreign-sounding names have lower fund flows relative to <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> non-foreign-sounding names. Further, those managers experience lower appreciation in flows following good performance and greater decline in flows following poor performance. These effects are stronger for funds that have more conservative investor clienteles or are located in regions where racial/ethnic stereotypes are more pronounced. In economic terms, <b>managers</b> <b>with</b> foreign-sounding names can incur an annual cost of 143, 000, although this cost can {{be as high as}} 600, 000. Collectively, our results show that social biases can affect capital allocations even in {{one of the largest and}} most liquid capital market segments...|$|R
