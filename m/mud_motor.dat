50|$|Normal <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> {{construction}} {{consists of}} a top sub, which connects the <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> to the drill string; the power section, which consists of the rotor and stator; the transmission section, where the eccentric power from the rotor is transmitted as concentric power to the bit using a constant-velocity joint; the bearing assembly which protects the tool from off bottom and on bottom pressures; and the bottom sub which connects the <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> to the bit.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> (or {{drilling}} motor) is {{a progressive}} cavity {{positive displacement pump}} (PCPD) placed in the drill string to provide additional power to the bit while drilling. The PCPD pump uses drilling fluid (commonly referred to as drilling mud, or just mud) to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit (well). The <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation, typically {{increasing the number of}} lobes and length of power assembly for greater horsepower. In certain applications, compressed air, or other gas, can be used for <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> input power. Normal rotation of the bit while using a <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> can be from 60 rpm, to over 100 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{rotating}} {{the drill}} bit {{by using a}} rotary table or top drive at the surface, it is turned by a downhole <b>MUD</b> <b>MOTOR,</b> powered by the motion of drilling fluid pumped from surface. Drilling which {{is powered by a}} <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> instead of a rotating pipe is generally called slide drilling.|$|E
5000|$|If not, the bit, {{drill string}} and <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> would fail more rapidly.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the methods of experimental research on rubber elastomers parameters of <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> at modeling the conditions of their operation. The specific features of <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> operation as well as main aggressive agents affecting the state and parameters of elastomers, such as drilling mud type, ambient temperature, and mechanical action of the rotor on the plate of the stator are shown in the paper. Due to described agents, new methods of investigations and new units of experimental bed are developed...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> may be {{sensitive}} to fouling agents. This means that certain types of drilling fluids or additives may ruin the motor or lower its performance. One particular example, as mentioned above, would be the use of oil based mud with the <b>mud</b> <b>motor.</b> Over time the oil degrades the elastomers and the seals in the motor.|$|E
50|$|A {{progressive}} {{cavity pump}} also {{can act as a}} motor (<b>mud</b> <b>motor)</b> when fluid is pumped through its interior. Applications include well drilling.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drill string}} {{mechanical}} {{equipment such as}} a <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> or MWD tools. If the additive(s) will not go through the drill string, they cannot be used.|$|E
50|$|MWD tools also {{generally}} provide toolface measurements {{to aid in}} {{directional drilling}} using downhole <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> with bent subs or bent housings. For {{more information on the}} use of toolface measurements, see Directional drilling.|$|R
50|$|The most typical {{reason for}} {{tripping}} pipe is {{to replace a}} worn-out drill bit. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as MWD (measurement while drilling), LWD (logging while drilling) or <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap.|$|R
5000|$|Combined, these survey {{tools and}} BHA designs made {{directional}} drilling possible, {{but it was}} perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when downhole drilling <b>motors</b> (aka <b>mud</b> <b>motors,</b> driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face {{at the bottom of}} the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a [...] "bent sub") between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another whipstock. Coupled with the development of measurement while drilling tools (using mud pulse telemetry, networked or wired pipe or EM telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send directional data back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic energy {{provides}} {{power to}} <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> for bit rotation and for MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (logging while drilling) tools. Hydraulic programs base on bit nozzles sizing for available mud pump horsepower to optimize jet impact at bottom well.|$|E
50|$|The use of mud motors {{is greatly}} {{dependent}} on financial efficiency. In straight vertical holes, the <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> {{may be used}} solely for increased rate of penetration (ROP), or to minimize erosion and wear on the drill string, since the drill string {{does not need to}} be turned as fast.|$|E
50|$|Drilling rigs are powered {{mechanically}} {{by rotating}} the drill pipe from above. Hydraulic power is still needed though, as between 2 and 7 hp {{are required to}} push mud through the drill bit in order to clear waste rock. This hydraulic power, considerably more than this, may {{also be used to}} drive a down-hole <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> to power directional drilling.|$|E
40|$|The project {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} measurements-while-drilling (MWD) module that provides real-time reports of drilling conditions at the bit. The module is to support multiple types of sensors and to sample and encode their outputs in digital form under microprocessor control. The assembled message is to be electromagnetically transmitted along the drill string back to its associated receiver located in a collar typically 50 [...] 100 feet above the bit. The receiver demodulates the transmitted message and passes it data to the third party wireline or MWD telemetry system for relay to the surface. The collar also houses the conventional MWD or wireline probe assembly. The completed Phase 1 program began with the preparation of detailed performance specifications and ended with the design, fabrication and testing of a functioning prototype. The prototype was sized for operation with 6 - 3 / 4 -inch multi-lobe <b>mud</b> <b>motors</b> due to the widespread use of this size motor in horizontal and directional drilling applications. The Phase 1 prototype provided inclination, temperature and pressure information. The Phase 2 program {{objective is to}} expand the current sensor suite to include at least one type of formation evaluation measurement, such as formation resistivity or natural gamma ray. The Near-Bit system will be subjected to a vigorous series of shock and vibration tests followed by field testing to ensure it possesses the reliability and performance required for commercial success...|$|R
50|$|The X-15 was {{released}} from the Stratofortress on schedule at 45,000 feet over Mud Lake, Nevada at 10:23:07.0 local time with a launch speed of 450 knots. Upon release, McKay was unable to attain the full power of the rocket engine which became stuck at 30% power and unresponsive to throttle control. Due to the lack of throttle response it was decided to make a forced landing at Mud Lake instead of landing at Edwards Air Force Base due to concerns about the reliability of the engine. McKay was at an altitude of 53,950 feet having attained a speed of Mach 1.49 when he started his descent for landing at <b>Mud</b> Lake. The <b>motor</b> was kept operating for 70.5 seconds to burn excess fuel and to reduce weight. The flaps failed to activate during landing and the aircraft speed at touchdown was higher than normal. Due to the excess speed and weight the aircraft experienced failures because of the increased dynamic loading which eventually led to its overturning.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{interest}} in extraterrestrial subsurface exploration has prompted {{an examination of}} advanced technologies for drilling slim holes and obtaining geophysical data in these holes. The borehole surveys with geophysical measurements called "logging", complement, and under favorable conditions, replace soil sampling. Very shallow drilling systems were used extensively during the Apollo lunar missions, and are {{in the planning stages}} for use on Mars. The prime objective is to gather scientific data, but these data could eventually provide a basis for the commercial use of space mineral resources. Given the strong scientific {{interest in}} water on Mars and the Moon, subsurface characterization with geophysical methods is attractive, because these methods can cover a much larger volume than soil sampling. Space technology has boosted the development of borehole geophysical instruments because both in space and in boreholes the instruments have to function in hostile environments, in confined spaces, {{and to be able to}} withstand large g-forces. This paper reviews oil industry drilling and geophysical borehole techniques that could be adopted for space applications. Coiled tubing drilling has many advantages because the surface facilities are compact, and an electrical cable in the tubing can transmit power and data. Moreover geophysical sensors can be embedded in the drill collars, which ensures that measurements are carried out while drilling, and this avoids risky reentry of geophysical tools in the hole. If kevlar is used for the coiled tubing, a laser beam could be transmitted via optic fibers in the coiled tubing wall. Using this beam to cut the rock would virtually eliminate <b>mud</b> and downhole <b>motor</b> requirements, and save a lot of weight. The quest for water and the strict [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{oil wells}} {{in modern times}} were drilled percussively, by repeatedly raising and dropping a cable tool into the earth. In the 20th century, cable tools were largely replaced with rotary drilling, which could drill boreholes to much greater depths and in less time. The record-depth Kola Borehole used non-rotary <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> drilling to achieve a depth of over 12000 m.|$|E
50|$|Use of this {{information}} can allow the operator to drill the well more efficiently, {{and to ensure that}} the MWD tool and any other downhole tools, such as a <b>mud</b> <b>motor,</b> rotary steerable systems, and LWD tools, are operated within their technical specifications to prevent tool failure. This information is also valuable to Geologists responsible for the well information about the formation which is being drilled.|$|E
50|$|Typically the <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> {{will be one}} {{component}} of a Coiled Tubing Drilling bottom hole assembly. The BHA also provides directional survey, gamma, pressure, temperature, and in some cases, petrophysical logs as drilling progresses. The latest generation of advanced Coiled tubing drilling BHAs offer the ability to steer the bit, enabling the well’s trajectory to be corrected {{in response to the}} measurements taken by the sensors.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> is {{described}} in terms of its number of stages (usually three), lobe ratio and external diameter. Stages are the number of full twists that the stator makes {{from one end to the}} other and the lobe ratio is the number of lobes on the stator, to the number of lobes on the rotor (the stator always has one more lobe than the rotor). A higher number of stages or the number of lobes indicates a more powerful motor, capable of producing more torque. A lower number of lobes indicates a reduction in the torque produced but a faster bit rotation speed.|$|E
50|$|Drill pipe is {{a portion}} of the overall drill string. The drill string {{consists}} of both drill pipe and the bottom hole assembly (BHA), which is the tubular portion closest to the bit. The BHA will be made of thicker walled heavy weight drill pipe (HWDP) and drill collars, which have a larger outside diameter and provide weight to the drill bit and stiffness to the drilling assembly. Other BHA components can include a <b>mud</b> <b>motor,</b> measurement while drilling (MWD) apparatus, stabilizers, and various specialty downhole tools. The drill stem includes the entire drill string, plus the kelly that imparts rotation and torque to the drill pipe at the top.|$|E
5000|$|A rotary {{steerable}} system (RSS) {{is a form}} of drilling technology used in directional drilling. It employs the use of specialized downhole equipment to replace conventional directional tools such as mud motors. They are generally programmed by the measurement while drilling (MWD) engineer or directional driller who transmits commands using surface equipment (typically using either pressure fluctuations in the mud column or variations in the drill string rotation) which the tool responds to, and gradually steers into the desired direction. In other words, a tool designed to drill directionally with continuous rotation from the surface, eliminating the need to [...] "slide" [...] a <b>mud</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> use {{is in the}} drilling of directional holes. Although other methods {{may be used to}} steer the bit to the desired target zone, they are more time consuming which adds to the cost of the well. Mud motors can be configured to have a bend in them using different settings on the motor itself. Typical mud motors can be modified from 0 degrees to 4 degrees with approximately six increments in deviation per degree of bend. The amount of bend is determined by rate of climb needed to reach the target zone. By using a measurement while drilling (MWD) tool, a directional driller can steer the bit to the desired target zone.|$|E
50|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has been}} used {{effectively}} for over 20 years {{in the oil industry}} and the technology has been evolving in order to meet changing industry demands. CTD takes the well-established concept of Coiled tubing and combines it with directional drilling using a <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> to create a system for drilling reservoirs. Bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. Coiled tubing drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional jointed pipe drilling rigs. Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits.|$|E
50|$|Turbodrills use the {{mechanical}} {{energy of the}} drill itself, and the hydraulic energy provided by the oil rig’s mud pumps to deliver power to the drill bit. The drill bit on a turbodrill spins much faster than on a conventional motor drill. The result is that, though there is less torque, this is compensated for by the increased speed, which makes straighter holes, and can drill faster and easier through tougher ground materials. The process {{is very similar to}} a dental drill used by a dentist. These tools are able to dig faster, operate in a much higher temperature environment, deliver longer downhole life, and produce a better and straighter hole quality than a conventional <b>mud</b> <b>motor.</b> In many applications turbodrills can offer their customers significant cost savings over standard drilling systems by saving them time spent drilling the hole since they typically pay drillers by the hour.|$|E

40|$|Tempress HydroPulse{trademark} tool {{increases}} overbalanced drilling {{rates by}} generating intense suction pulses at the drill bit. This report describes {{the operation of}} the tool; results of pressure drilling tests, wear tests and downhole drilling tests; and the business case for field applications. The HydroPulse{trademark} tool is designed to operate on weighted drilling mud at conventional flow rates and pressures. Pressure drilling tests confirm that the HydroPulse{trademark} tool provides 33 % to 200 % increased rate of penetration. Field tests demonstrated conventional rotary and <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> drilling operations. The tool has been operated continuous for 50 hours on weighted mud in a wear test stand. This level of reliability is the threshold for commercial application. A seismic-while-drilling version of the tool was also developed and tested. This tool was used to demonstrate reverse vertical seismic profiling while drilling an inclined test well with a PDC bit. The primary applications for the HydroPulse{trademark} tool are deep onshore and offshore drilling where rate of penetration drives costs. The application of the seismic tool is vertical seismic profiling-while-drilling and look-ahead seismic imaging while drilling...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this effort is to develop, build and test a high-speed drilling motor that can meet the performance guidelines of the announcement, namely: 'The motors are expected to rotate at a minimum of 10, 000 rpm, have an OD no larger than 7 inches and work downhole continuously for at least 100 hours. The motor must have common oilfield thread connections capable of making up to a drill bit and bottomhole assembly. The motor must be capable of transmitting drilling fluid through the motor'. To these goals, APS would add that the motor must be economically viable, {{in terms of both}} its manufacturing and maintenance costs, and be applicable to as broad a range of markets as possible. APS has taken the approach of using a system using planetary gears to increase the speed of a conventional <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> to 10, 000 rpm. The mud flow is directed around the outside of the gear train, and a unique flow diversion system has been employed. A prototype of the motor was built and tested in APS's high-pressure flow loop. The motor operated per the model up to {approx} 4200 rpm. At that point a bearing seized and the performance was severely degraded. The motor is being rebuilt and will be retested outside of this program...|$|E
40|$|Three long {{horizontal}} holes were drilled from a directionally drilled sur 2 {{hole at the}} Emerald Mine near Waynesburg, Pa. The {{purpose was}} to adapt the technique of directional drilling for use in draining methane from coalbeds. A 504 -m (1, 652 -ft) long, 76 -mm (3 -in) diam 2, circular arc pilot hole was drilled, using a downhole <b>mud</b> <b>motor,</b> to enter the Pittsburgh coalbed at a verti 2 depth of 305 m (1, 000 ft). The hole was reamed to 222 mm (8 - 3 / 4 in) and was cased to a measured depth of 486 m (1, 595 ft). Three 76 -mm (3 -in) diameter horizontal drainage holes were then drilled, totaling 2, 909 m (9, 544 ft) of horizontal hole. Improvements in drilling methods increased the average drilling rate from 20. 4 m (67 ft) to 64. 9 m (213 ft) per day. The cost of drilling the directional and horizontal holes (using a Government-owned drill rig) was 1, 169, 530, a figure inflated by inexperience and by delays caused by lost-circulation problems and fishing operations. An estimated total drilling cost of 960, 000 (including rental of a drill rig) for an improved system, was determined by a detailed cost analysis. Initial gas and water production from November 1979 through May 1980 was low because of caving of the horizontal holes drilled in shale {{near the bottom of}} the casing...|$|E
40|$|World-wide the {{turbidity}} of many rivers, estuaries {{and shallow}} seas is increasing, leading to degradation of {{water quality and}} growing siltation. Large volumes of dredged sediments are disposed and lost offshore, while coastal regions and river banks are eroding, exposing towns to more recurrent flooding. A huge amount of sediment is trapped in reservoirs behind dams, reducing their storage and flood mitigation capabilities. These are all indicators that smart and integrated sediment management is necessary. At the same time, coastal development activities demand for large quantities of sediment as building material, with {{many areas of the}} world characterized by fine sediments (mud), especially in large river delta regions. Integrated sediment management approaches leveraging on Building with Nature (BwN) concepts represents a potentially powerful solution to these enormous world-wide challenges and societal needs. With this in mind, EcoShape initiated the Living Lab for Mud (LLM), an initiative that aims to develop integrated knowledge and technologies to improve understanding and implementation of management, use and reuse of (fine and soft) sediments often linked to the reinforcement, safety and restoration of coastal ecosystems (e. g. salt marshes and mangroves) or land reclamation. The LLM consists of a series of pilot projects within and outside the Netherlands, which integrate the various aspects and processes of sediment management: from sedimentation and resuspension, to fate and transport, to consolidation and strength development. The LLM integrates these physical processes with biota and socio-economic aspects, in order to develop feasible, applicable and sustainable BwN based solutions. Pilots include strategic sediment disposal to naturally nourish coastal mudflats (i. e. <b>Mud</b> <b>Motor,</b> The Netherlands), enhancing sediment trapping to encourage mangroves restoration and coastal aggradation (i. e. Demak, Indonesia), and ripening of fine dredged sediments for production of building material (i. e. Kleirijperij, The Netherlands). This presentation will introduce the LLM initiative and give an overview of these pilot projects...|$|E
40|$|This project used {{a systems}} {{approach}} to improve slim-hole drilling performance. A high power <b>mud</b> <b>motor,</b> having a double-length power section, and hybrid PDC/TSP drill bit {{were developed to}} deliver maximum horsepower to the rock while providing a long life down hole. This high-power slim-hole drilling system drills much faster than conventional slim-hole motor and bit combinations and holds significant potential to reduce slim-hole drilling costs. The oil and gas industries have been faced with downward price pressures since the 1980 s. These pressures {{are not expected to}} be relieved in the near future. To maintain profitability, companies have had to find ways to reduce the costs of producing oil and gas. Drilling {{is one of the more}} costly operations in the production process. One method to reduce costs of drilling is to use smaller more mobile equipment. Slim holes have been drilled in the past using this principle. These wells can save money not only from the use of smaller drilling equipment, but also from reduced tubular costs. Stepping down even one casing size results in significant savings. However, slim holes have not found wide spread use for three reasons. First, until recently, the price of oil has been high so there were no forces to move the industry in this direction. Second, small roller bits and motors were not very reliable and they drilled slowly, removing much of the economic benefit. The third and final reason was the misconception that large holes were needed everywhere to deliver the desired production. Several factors have changed that will encourage the use of slim holes. The industry now favors any method of reducing the costs of producing oil and gas. In addition, the industry now understands that large holes are not always needed. Gas, in particular, can have high production rates in smaller holes. New materials now make it possible to manufacture improved bits and motors that drill for long periods at high rates. All that remains is to gather all the elements together and demonstrate the savings of slim hole drilling...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is {{developed for the}} nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation {{is based on a}} three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, rotary steerable systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied {{to a wide range of}} drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome parasitic axial drag acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable <b>mud</b> <b>motor</b> in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to ? 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions...|$|E
