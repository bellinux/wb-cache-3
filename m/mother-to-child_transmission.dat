STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. <b>Mother-to-child</b> <b>transmission</b> of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities.

5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.

Maternal HIV- 1 coinfection (crude odds ratios [OR], 1. 41; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 16 – 1. 66; P. 007) and IDU (OR, 1. 58; 95 % CI, 1. 37 – 1. 78; P,. 00001) were linked to <b>mother-to-child</b> HCV <b>transmission</b> in unadjusted analysis when all anti–HCV-positive mothers were evaluated.

40|$|Background: An {{estimated}} 1. 2 {{percent of}} pregnant women are living with HIV in Ethiopia and sadly, one of every 3 children born to these women is infected with HIV. Elimination of these <b>mother-to-child</b> <b>transmissions</b> (MTCT) of HIV is possible through HIV testing during pregnancy and taking antiretroviral medications. However, only 24 percent {{of pregnant women}} living with HIV have yet received the medication needed to prevent MTCT of HIV in Amhara region, Ethiopia. Hence, there exists a concern {{that the rate of}} HIV infection among infants born to HIV positive mothers might be high.

Methods: All eligible records of HIV-exposed infants enrolled between January and December 2012 were reviewed from 17 health facilities which were providing PMTCT services.

Despite strong support for good breastfeeding practice, only 37 % of women were still EBF at week 16.

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that, in hindsight, the {{campaign}} for the universal promotion of breastfeeding prior to the acknowledgement of HIV contraction via <b>mother-to-child</b> <b>transmission</b> (MTCT) fails to consider affected mothers in developing countries who have limited or no access to procedures that would minify the chance of spreading the virus to their young ones. Initiatives for a decreased percentage of infants contracting HIV include administering Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to their mothers and providing milk formula in hand with proper water sterilization techniques to prevent disease from contamination.

25|$|Given {{the high}} risk of {{perinatal}} transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit. It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine. Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL. A {{growing body of evidence}} shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate. A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug.

40|$|Background: Breast milk {{transmission}} of HIV- 1 remains a major route of pediatric infection. Defining {{the characteristics of}} viral variants to which breastfeeding infants are exposed is important for understanding the genetic bottleneck that occurs {{in the majority of}} <b>mother-to-child</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The blood-milk epithelial barrier markedly restricts the quantity of HIV- 1 in breast milk, {{even in the absence of}} antiretroviral drugs. The basis of this restriction and the genetic relationship between breast milk and blood variants are not well established. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared 356 HIV- 1 subtype C gp 160 envelope (env) gene sequences from the plasma and breast milk of 13 breastfeeding women. A trend towards lower viral population diversity and divergence in breast milk was observed, potentially indicative of clonal expansion within the breast.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction In 2011, 330, 000 infants acquired HIV infection from their mothers [1]. Most of <b>mother-to-child</b> <b>transmissions</b> (MTCT) occur in low- and middle-income countries, where HIV transmission through breastfeeding accounts for 30 – 50 % of infant infections in the absence of anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis [2]. In sub-Saharan Africa, formula feeding is not a recommended alternative due to its association with increased morbidity and mortality, caused by malnutrition, respiratory diseases and diar-rheal complications [3]. Furthermore, several studies have substantiated the benefit of breastfeeding over formula feeding, despite the risk of breast milk trans-mission [4 - 6]. WHO currently recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by complementary foods and breastfeeding until 12 months of age, accompanied by postnatal infant or maternal anti-retroviral prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission during breastfeeding [1].
