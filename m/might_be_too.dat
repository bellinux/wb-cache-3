5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|Forster {{was born}} in Hexham, Northumberland, the son of Brian Clive Forster QC (who later became a circuit judge), and {{attended}} the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, but did not begin playing as a goalkeeper until he was 13 years old. Before then he had mainly played either rugby union or cricket. Coaches initially thought Forster <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> small to play as a goalkeeper, although he played for local junior team Stocksfield before joining the renowned Wallsend Boys Club. However, he entered a significant growth spurt at 15 {{years of age and}} later signed with Newcastle United.|$|E

50|$|From 1900 to 1910, the {{position}} of Supreme Patriarch of Thailand remained vacant. Reynolds speculates that King Chulalongkorn didn't want to appoint a successor to the 9th Patriarch because a senior monk <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> conservative to support the ongoing reforms, and Vajirañana <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> still <b>too</b> young to <b>be</b> able to assert his reforms against {{the will of the}} conservative senior monks.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Heyman of The New York Times {{warned that}} Wildwood <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> violent for some readers, having {{many of the}} horrors so {{frequently}} found in Decemberists songs, including battles when people and animals die by musket and cannon fire, sword blows, and falling, and references to torture, {{and the threat of}} the blood sacrifice of a baby at the book's climax.|$|E
25|$|With the {{repetition}} of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly {{on the side of}} the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> dangerous), he does seem to push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.|$|E

Initially, she {{worried that she}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> shy to play before big crowds, but she eventually triumphed over her fear and realized her tremendous talent as a live performer when she played to rapt audiences at coffee houses and rallies around the sprawling Rutgers campus. She worked as a flight attendant before starting her music career.|$|E
25|$|Her Republican {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Randy Graf, a conservative former state senator known for his enforcement-only position on immigration and illegal aliens. Graf had run against Jim Kolbe in the 2004GOP primary and had announced his candidacy in 2006 before Kolbe announced his retirement. The Republican establishment was somewhat cool toward Graf, believing he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> conservative for the district. The national GOP took the unusual step of endorsing one of the more moderate candidates in the primary. Graf won anyway, helped by a split in the Republican moderate vote between two candidates.|$|E
25|$|Practical {{difficulties}} included recruiting teachers {{by ethnic}} group rather than language ability. Consequently, some teachers {{were expected to}} teach their ethnic language even if their ability was poor while other teachers, who could speak the ethnic language, were not recruited. Teachers who could speak the local language had no training in its structure or written form. Local languages could lack standardization and their vocabularies <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> limited to cover the curriculum. Lack of dictionaries and grammar books meant that teachers had no guide to {{the proper use of}} language and textbooks were the only written material to help students with reading. One solution to these problems has been to allow bilingual instruction and Amharic sections in some schools.|$|E

25|$|Evan-Thomas' next {{appointment}} in October 1915 was as {{commander of the}} 5th Battle Squadron, which consisted of the five newly completed Queen Elizabeth-class fast battleships, arguably the most powerful ships afloat at that time. HMS Barham was chosen as flagship for the admiral. The 15inch gun ships, capable of 24 knots, formed a fast division attached to the Grand Fleet, complementing the fast battlecruiser squadron which normally served in a detached scouting role. The posting was considered prestigious. It {{is likely that the}} choice of Evan-Thomas for the post was influenced by his previous friendship with Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet but also by Jellicoe's concerns not to appoint an officer to the post who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> independent of mind. The appointment was likely also to be acceptable to Beatty, commanding the battlecruisers, since he had seniority over Evan-Thomas and would command in any joint operation. Although the Queen Elizabeths were slightly slower than the battlecruisers, Beatty continued for some time to campaign that they should be permanently attached to his command as the fast division of the fleet.|$|E

While Mary McCormack lobbied for the role, Nolan decided to cast Moss as Natalie, saying, [...] "She added an enormous amount {{to the role of}} Natalie that wasn't on the page". For the corrupt police officer Teddy, [...] "comedian Denis Leary was mentioned, though proved unavailable". Moss suggested her co-star from The Matrix, Joe Pantoliano. Although there was a concern that Pantoliano <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> villainous for the part, he was still cast, and Nolan said he was surprised by the actor's subtlety in his performance.|$|E

They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} of the pilot's script (and the show's concept) was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke considered that viewers enjoyed the series' mythology as it affected the characters, despite the show's Sliding Doors–like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs felt that the show was complicated; knowing which reality you are in was a [...] "gift." [...] He stated that work for Awake was hard, but enjoyable. Isaacs later suggested that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> brooding for mainstream American television, {{and that it could}} potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts."

During the planning stage of the attacks, Mohamed Atta, the hijacker and pilot of Flight 11, thought the White House <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> tough a target and sought an assessment from Hani Hanjour (who hijacked and piloted Flight 77).
