As a consequence, almost all the <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturing companies of New York went out of business in the years immediately following the war. The exceptions were the Morgan Iron Works, and the Etna Iron Works of John Roach.|$|E

25|$|The first {{patented}} oscillating {{engine was}} built by Joseph Maudslay in 1827, but the type is considered to have been perfected by John Penn. Oscillating engines remained a popular type of <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> {{for much of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Since New York {{was already}} {{well served by}} a number of {{existing}} <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> plants, Lawrence & Foulks, like the other New York shipyards, had no need to establish an expensive engine plant of its own, but could rely upon outsourcing for its steamship engines. Companies which would build marine engines for Lawrence & Foulks prior to the Civil War included leading firms such as the Allaire Iron Works, Morgan Iron Works, Henry Esler & Co. and the Novelty Iron Works. After the war, when many of New York's <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers went out of business, Lawrence & Foulks appears to have come increasingly to rely upon New Jersey's Fletcher, Harrison & Co. to meet its machinery requirements.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of hostilities, the U.S. {{government}} dumped more than a million tons of unwanted shipping onto the market, driving down prices and depriving the shipbuilding industry of new orders. The slump lasted several years, and many ship and <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> builders were driven to bankruptcy in this period.|$|E
25|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> {{works of}} T. F. Secor and Co. was {{originally}} established in New York City, at Ninth Street, East River, in 1838.

Caulkin and budding transport entrepreneur Charles Morgan, each of whom had one-third ownership of the new firm.|$|E

25|$|Most early <b>marine</b> <b>engines</b> had {{the same}} {{cylinder}} technology (simple expansion, see below) {{but a number of}} different methods of supplying power to the crankshaft (i.e. connection mechanism) were in use. Thus, early <b>marine</b> <b>engines</b> are classified mostly according to their connection mechanism. Some common connection mechanisms were side-lever, steeple, walking beam and direct-acting (see following sections).|$|R

25|$|The side-lever {{engine was}} the first type of steam engine to be widely adopted for marine use in Europe. In {{the early years of}} steam {{navigation}} (from c1815), the side-lever was {{the most common type of}} <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> for inland waterway and coastal service in Europe, and it remained for many years the preferred engine for oceangoing service on both sides of the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. {{government}} {{auctioned off}} the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work.

25|$|John Roach {{began his}} career in the United States in 1832 as a {{semi-literate}} Irish immigrant laborer, eventually establishing his own small business with the purchase of the Etna Iron Works. Roach took advantage of the American Civil War to transform the Etna Iron Works into a major manufacturer of marine steam engines, and after the war, with the purchase in 1867 of the Morgan Iron Works, secured a near-monopoly on <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> building in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} war, the U.S. Navy {{auctioned}} off hundreds of ships it had requisitioned {{for the war}} effort, flooding the market and seriously depressing prices. The resulting slump in the U.S. shipping industry sent many long-established American shipyards and marine engineers to the wall, and New York {{was one of the}} worst affected locations, with its maritime industry all but wiped out by the slump. By 1867, most of Roach's <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> competitors had gone bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the war in April 1865, the U.S. {{shipbuilding}} industry {{experienced a}} severe downturn. The Navy dumped more than a million tons of unwanted shipping onto the market, depressing prices and leaving shipyards with no work. High postwar prices, along with a series of bitter (and unsuccessful) strikes for the eight-hour day, helped prolong the slump to {{the end of the}} decade. The slump had a devastating effect on the New York shipbuilding industry, with most of the city's shipbuilders and <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers going out of business in this period.|$|E
25|$|Roach {{had long}} nurtured {{a desire to}} become a builder of marine steam engines like his mentor James Allaire. Competition in the {{industry}} was fierce, and entry difficult due to high capital costs, but Roach believed that by utilization of the best tools, labor-saving devices and practices, he could compete successfully. Accordingly, through the late 1850s he sent engineers to the United Kingdom to study the latest in <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> technology, and was not above hiring himself out as a mechanic to New York's leading engine builders {{of the day to}} spy on their organization, technology and practices.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. {{government}} {{auctioned off}} the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work. The result was that most American shipyards, along with <b>marine</b> <b>engine</b> specialists, failed. Not only the Westervelt shipyard, but the whole shipbuilding industry in New York was badly affected by the slump, being practically wiped out in the ensuing years. As the demise of shipbuilding after the war afforded him little opportunity to recover from his losses, the firm was dissolved in 1868, with no large surplus of assets. By this time Westervelt had constructed 247 ships with his partners, more than any other American shipbuilder in his day.|$|E
