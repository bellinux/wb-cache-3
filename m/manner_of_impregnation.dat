Catalysts were made of a mixture of carrier materials, such as titania or γ-alumina, and active components such as V 2 O 5 and promoters such as La 2 O 3, Ce 2 O 3, WO 3, and MoO 3. Active metal and promoters were deposited on the support by adopting a wet impregnation method. For evaluation of factors effects such as V, La, Ce, W, Mo, loading, calcination time, temperature, support type and special <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> accomplish <b>impregnation,</b> 12 samples were made by experimental design method. For evaluation of specification of samples analytical techniques such as XRD, XRF, specific surface area measurements, pore size distribution and reactor test for evaluation of activity were used. It was observed that catalyst with −γ alumina support converted more NOx than catalyst with titania support. NOx conversion varies very low with increasing calcination time and Ce loadings. NOx conversion decreases with increasing of W and La loadings and also calcination temperature and increases with increasing of V and Mo loadings though (Maximum average of activity for 4 % and 1 % Vanadium was obtained 29. 31 and 21. 30 respectively).

The results show that: the main pore diameter of the graphite materials is in the interval of mµ 3 ~ 1, most {{of which can be}} filled by impregnation antimony, and graphite and impregnation antimony materials both have the fractal characteristics. Graphite materials also have the dual fractal characteristics. Its fractal inflection point aperture is about 1 µm, and the fractal dimension (3. 05 ~ 3. 25) of the small pores (φ≤ 1 µm) is less than the one (3. 71 ~ 3. 95) of the large pores (φ> 1 µm). The reason why existing the dual fractal characteristics is that the size of the pore formation mechanism is different. Impregnation occurs mainly in the range of large pores, characteristics of which is an important factor to influence the quality <b>of</b> <b>impregnation</b> materials.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{basic methods}} of impregnating porous bodies with solutions of polymers {{and their use}} to manufacture prepregs. It also describes the existing methods of manufacturing multilayer prepregs to produce aerospace coating of the spacecraft "Soyuz". It is shown that these prepregs have to meet high requirements for {{the content of the}} polymer, as compared with other composite materials, about 35 - 40 % of the mass. Methods used for their manufacturing are long-term and non-controllable. The assumption is made that using the vacuum <b>impregnation</b> technology <b>of</b> a woven material will allow to accelerate the manufacturing process of these prepregs and improve their quality. In reviewing the technical literature have been found works on modeling the processes <b>of</b> <b>impregnation,</b> but they are aimed only at studying the speed of the woven material impregnation by various fluids and determining the time <b>of</b> <b>impregnation.</b> There were no models found to define prepreg parameters during the process <b>of</b> multiple <b>impregnations.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this work is to develop the simple mathematical model, which enables us to predict the polymer content of volatile products in the prepreg after each cycle <b>of</b> multiple <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> woven material with a solution of the polymer. To consider the vacuum impregnation method are used the prepregs based on silica and silica-nylon stitch-bonding fabric and bakelite varnish LBS- 4 containing 50 - 60 % of phenol resin and the solvent with minor impurities of pure phenol and water, as an example. To describe the process <b>of</b> vacuum <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> the porous work-piece is developed a mathematical description of the process of filling the porous space of the material with a varnish. It is assumed that the varnish components fill the porous space of the material in the same proportion as they are contained in the varnish. It is shown that a single impregnation cannot ensure the content of phenol resin in the prepreg over 32 %, which does not meet requirements. The paper presents a developed mathematical model <b>of</b> repeated <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> silica fabrics by bakelite varnish with intermediate drying of the workpiece. Equations determining the amount of the polymer and the volatile products after each impregnation-drying cycle are derived. Results of calculations obtained by the mathematical model are given. The calculation results show that the multiple impregnations allow us to increase the polymer content in the prepreg and provide required parameters for a few cycles <b>of</b> <b>impregnation.</b> In the calculations were also considered various drying options with removal of different amounts of solvent. The calculations have shown that providing the specified parameters is possible if more than 50 % of solvent contained in the prepreg after impregnation is removed.

A value (C) is measured, related to the dielectric constant, which gives the impregnating penetration (D) of the carrier material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In an INDEPENDENT CLAIM the monitoring system has a conductor (3) so that the carrier material acts as a dielectric to affect the electrical capacity of the conductor (3), which is measured. The conductor can be an electrically conductive strip, around the carrier material, with the electrical lead of the conductor rod. To measure the value (C), the electrical capacity is used of an electrical conductor, with the carrier material acting as a dielectric. The timed run (C(t)) of the measurement gives the timed run (D(t)) <b>of</b> the <b>impregnation.</b> A functional relationship (DR(C)) between a reference impregnation (DR) and the measured value gives the functional relationship <b>of</b> the <b>impregnation.</b> The timed run (D(t)) <b>of</b> the <b>impregnation</b> (D) is expressed as D(t) =DR(C(t)), where D is the impregnation, DR the reference impregnation, C the measured value and especially capacity, and t is the time. The amount <b>of</b> <b>impregnation</b> {{is defined as the}} ratio of impregnated and non-impregnated vols. of the carrier material. To determine the stages <b>of</b> <b>impregnation,</b> according to given parameters, each stage has a reference impregnation provided by a simulation model with a spaced distribution in the carrier material with at least one zone which is not impregnated and one zone which is impregnated. At least one dry zone (4) has an initial dielectric constant and at least one damp zone (5) has another dielectric constant. Each reference impregnation (DR), together with the dielectric constants, is associated with a measured value (C) to give the required functional relationship (CD(C)). Using a porous carrier material, the spaced distribution <b>of</b> the reference <b>impregnation</b> (DR) uses the Darcy law for a current <b>of</b> a Newton <b>impregnation</b> medium or by using a suitable modification of the Darcy law for a non-Newton impregnation medium. From the impregnation (D), the penetration depth is derived <b>of</b> the <b>impregnation</b> medium in the carrier material, in a timed run of the penetration and at least one factor of the filtration coefficient, flow resistance, permeability and relative porosity, which also gives the viscosity of the impregnating medium.

40|$|Abstract. Pulp {{from the}} oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) was {{extracted}} via Alkaline Peroxide Pulping (APP). The pulping process was conducted through three main steps; dewaxing <b>of</b> EFB, <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> alkaline peroxide (AP) into EFB and refining of biomass to finally produce the pulp. The varying peroxide levels and number <b>of</b> <b>impregnation</b> stages were found to affect the refining energy consumption and {{the properties of the}} resultant pulp and paper. Diagnosis by electron microscopic imaging revealed a strong correlation between paper properties development and paper surface morphologies. By multiplying the stages of the low alkaline peroxide level (2 : 2. 5 % AP) impregnation, refining energy could be reduced by 30 % while improving brightness and paper mechanical properties. Higher alkaline peroxide level (4 : 5 % AP) could reduce the refining energy by 50 % while still improving brightness. Beyond these AP levels (8 : 10 % AP), refining energy could be reduced by 67 % by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>impregnation</b> stages, with positive effects on brightness and paper mechanical properties. The findings suggest that increasing the AP impregnation stages had exposed more active sites to react with AP. The enhanced AP accessibility to EFB structures facilitated mechanical fibrillation of EFB vascular bundles through the refining process. The proper synergy between AP and the adopted mechanical refining was the factor that triggered the liberation of nano-cells from EFB biomass and this had ultimately improved paper properties...|$|R
