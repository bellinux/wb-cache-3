5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

25|$|In the main, {{experience}} in the introduction of wholesale and retail competition has been mixed. Many regional markets have achieved some success and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition. However, in 2000/2001 major failures such as the California electricity crisis and the Enron debacle caused a slow down in {{the pace of change}} and in some regions an increase in <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> and reduction in competition.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{contribution}} of <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> in {{the dynamics of the}} real exchange rate within the European Union. Based on a model proposed by De Gregorio et al. (1994 a), we show that both product <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> in nontradable sectors and employment protection tend to inflate the real exchange rate. We then carry out an econometric estimation for European countries over 1985 - 2006 to quantify the contributions of the pure Balassa-Samuelson effect and those of <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> in real exchange-rate variations. Based on this evidence and on a counter-factual experiment, we conclude that the relative evolution of product <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> and employment protection across countries play a very significant role in real exchange-rate variations within the European Union and especially within the Euro area, through theirs impacts on the relative price of nontradable goods...|$|R
25|$|Other {{causes of}} {{perceived}} insulation from risk may derive from a given entity's predominance {{in a market}} relative to other players, and not from state intervention or <b>market</b> <b>regulation.</b> A firm – or several large firms acting in concert (see cartel, oligopoly and collusion) – with very large holdings and capital reserves could instigate a market bubble by investing heavily in a given asset, creating a relative scarcity which drives up that asset's price. Because of the signaling power of the large firm or group of colluding firms, the firm's smaller competitors will follow suit, similarly investing in the asset due to its price gains.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} in the UK about the cost/benefit nature of nuclear energy, as well as ideological influence (for instance, those favouring 'energy security' generally arguing pro, while those worried about the 'environmental impact' against). Because of this, and a lack of a consistent energy policy in the UK since the mid-1990s, no new reactors have been built since Sizewell B in 1995. Costs have been a major influence to this (with Sizewell B having run at a cost of 6p/kWh for its first five years of operation), while the long lead-time between proposal and operation (at ten years or more) has put off many investors, especially with long-term considerations such as energy <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> and nuclear waste remaining unresolved.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.|$|E

40|$|Inflation can “grease” {{the wheels}} of the labor market by {{relaxing}} downward wage rigidity but it can also increase uncertainty and have a negative “sand” effect. This paper studies the grease effect of inflation by looking at whether the interaction between inflation and labor <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> affects how employment responds to changes in output. The results show that in industrial countries with highly regulated labor markets, the grease effect of inflation dominates the sand effect. In the case of developing countries, we rarely find a significant effect of inflation or labor <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> and provide evidence indicating that this could be due to the presence of a large informal sector and limited enforcement of de jure labor <b>market</b> <b>regulations.</b> ...|$|R

"In the Continental European System of labour <b>market</b> <b>regulation,</b> the {{government}} {{plays an important}} role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights, which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers' associations on the other. This model was said to be found in EU core countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the EU, due to the relative weight that these countries had in the EU until the EU expansion by the inclusion of 10 new Eastern European member states in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{research}} on the drivers of multi-factor productivity (MFP) is abundant at the firm- and industry level but surprisingly {{little research has been}} conducted on the determinants of MFP at the macroeconomic level. In this paper, we seek to understand the drivers of country-level MFP with a special emphasis on product and labour market policies and the quality of institutions. For a panel of OECD countries, we find that anticompetitive product <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> are associated with lower MFP levels and that higher innovation intensity and greater openness go in tandem with higher MFP. We also find that the impact of product <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> on MFP may depend on the level of labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations.</b> Better institutions, a more business friendly environment and lower barriers to trade and investment amplify the positive impact of R&D spending on MFP. Finally, we also show that cross-country MFP variations can be explained to a considerable extent by cross-country variation in labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations,</b> barriers to trade and investment and institutions (including corruption) ...|$|R
