5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the <b>Master</b> <b>School</b> of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on {{the site where the}} Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the <b>Master</b> <b>School</b> for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E
