500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is {{difficult for me to}} admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, she told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At {{the end of the}} performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{inspired}} by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue {{during the early years}} of her success with the observation: [...] "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [...] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, [...] "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [...] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as [...] "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, [...] "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [...] Minogue has said of Madonna, [...] "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done everything there was to be done", and [...] "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [...] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2016, {{transcripts}} of two 2015 affidavits of private investigator Dominic Casey were filed {{on the court}} docket {{in the matter of}} Kronk v. Anthony and picked up by news services in May 2016. In one affidavit, Casey stated that on July 26, 2008, Baez admitted to him that Casey Anthony murdered Caylee Anthony [...] "and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did". He also claimed that Baez had a sexual relationship with Anthony, and that [...] "Casey told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do what Jose said because she had no money for her defense." [...] Baez [...] "vehemently" [...] denied a sexual relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews' {{stepfather}} sponsored {{lessons for}} her, {{first at the}} Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as ArtsEd), an independent arts educational school in London, then with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. [...] "She had an enormous influence on me", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, [...] "She was my third mother– I've got more mothers and fathers {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] In her memoir Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records: [...] "The range, accuracy, and tone of Julie's voice amazed <b>me</b> ... <b>she</b> <b>had</b> possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch" [...] (though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home). According to Andrews: [...] "Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was". Of her own voice, she says [...] "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come for miles around." [...] After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.|$|E
2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
6000|$|I had angered her! Worse; I had exposed her to humiliation at {{the hands}} of that unworthy animal who soiled her in thought with the slime of his suspicions.
