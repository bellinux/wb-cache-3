25|$|Bell is also {{credited}} with developing {{one of the}} early versions of a metal detector in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the <b>metal</b> <b>bed</b> frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to relieve the sick man from {{the heat of a}} Washington summer, Navy {{engineers}} rigged up an early version of the modern air conditioner. Fans blew air over a large box of ice and into the President's sickroom; the device worked well enough to lower the temperature twenty degrees. Doctors continued to probe Garfield's wound with dirty, unsterilized fingers and instruments, attempting to find the location of the bullet. Alexander Graham Bell devised a metal detector specifically for the purpose of finding the bullet lodged inside Garfield. [...] He was unsuccessful, partly because Garfield's <b>metal</b> <b>bed</b> frame made the instrument malfunction, and partly because Bliss allowed Bell to use the device only on Garfield's right side, where Bliss insisted the bullet had lodged. Bell's subsequent tests indicated that his metal detector was in good working order, and that he would have found the bullet had he been allowed to use the device on Garfield's left side.|$|E

After <b>metal</b> hydride <b>beds</b> {{have reached the}} end of their useful life, the beds will {{replaced}} with new beds and the old beds prepared for disposal. One acceptance criteria for hydride bed waste disposal is that the material inside the bed not be pyrophoric. To determine the pyrophoric nature of spent <b>metal</b> hydride <b>beds,</b> controlled air ingress tests were performed. A simple gas handling manifold fitted with pressure transducers and a calibrated volume were used to introduce controlled quantities of air into a <b>metal</b> hydride <b>bed</b> and the bed temperature rise monitored for reactivity with the air. A desorbed, 4. 4 kg titanium prototype hydride storage vessel (HSV) produced a 4. 4 C internal temperature rise upon the first air exposure cycle and a 0. 1 C temperature rise upon a second air exposure. A total of 346 scc air was consumed by the bed (0. 08 scc per gram Ti). A desorbed, 9. 66 kg LaNi{sub 4. 25 }Al{sub 0. 75 } prototype storage bed experienced larger temperature rises over successive cycles of air ingress and evacuation.

50|$|The Simmons Manufacturing Company {{was known}} from its {{inception}} for woven wire mattress springs, cradles, <b>metal</b> <b>beds</b> and wooden folding chairs. In 1916 Zalmon II looked to expand the company nationally. The Simmons Company purchased the Rudger-Merle Company in San Francisco followed by a plant in Los Angeles. In 1918 the company purchased of the largest bedding company in the east, New Jersey’s Newark Spring Mattress Company. This acquisition extended the company's product lines from cradles, <b>metal</b> <b>beds</b> and woven wire bed springs into the padded bedding and mattress industry. Z.G. II’s desire to revolutionize the company would eventually lead to a mass-produced pocketed coil innerspring mattress known as the Beautyrest. The success of this new business venture led to the purchase of Atlanta, Georgia mattress maker Hirsch and Spitz and a Seattle plant in 1919. With the company’s new acquisitions, Simmons Manufacturing Company was officially in the mattress business. Z.G. Simmons II, known by now as “the Chief”, continued {{to find ways to}} improve and expand. Z. G II innovated a nationwide service station program. Through this system retailers were given samples of Simmons products for the consumer to view. When the customer placed an order it was delivered within 24 hours from one of Simmons warehouses. These company advancements led to the decision to move his family and his company offices east in 1923. He relocated the Simmons Company headquarters to 280 Park Avenue in New York City. This same year The Simmons Company stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.|$|R

40|$|The {{exposure}} of heavy <b>metals</b> to lake <b>bed</b> sediment of scenic areas may pose risks on aquatic ecosystems and human health, however very few studies on risk assessment {{have been reported}} for scenic areas. Accordingly, this study determined concentration levels, and assessed contamination characteristics and risks, of heavy <b>metals</b> in lake <b>bed</b> sediment of National Scenic Areas Songhuahu (NSAS) in China. The concentrations of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were determined in 29 bed sediment samples. Results showed that the mean values of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were 92. 69, 90. 73, 38. 29, 46. 77, and 49. 44 mg/kg, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that organic matter was a major factor influencing distribution of heavy metals. The results for enrichment factors indicated that contamination rates and anthropogenic inputs of single heavy metals decreased in the order Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Zn; results of Nemerow integrated pollution index suggested that 72. 41 % of sampling sites were exposed to low to moderately integrated pollution, and 27. 59 % of sampling sites were exposed to strongly integrated pollution.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{utilization}} of some novel <b>metal</b> oxide <b>bed</b> materials in dual-fluidized bed gasification systems has been investigated. For this purpose, <b>metal</b> oxide based <b>bed</b> materials can be 1) directly utilized in the dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFB) or in the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process {{in order to achieve}} higher gasification rates, or 2) employed in downstream hot gas conditioning processes, e. g. Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR), in order to reform hydrocarbons in the raw gasification gas. When utilizing such bed materials directly in the primary loop of a DFB gasifier or a CLC fuel reactor, it was shown in this work that the char gasification rate can be increased by different mechanisms. First, the gasification rate can be increased by reducing hydrogen inhibition of the steam gasification reaction. This decrease is caused by the rapid reaction of the <b>metal</b> oxide <b>bed</b> materials with hydrogen produced by the steam gasification. Thus, hydrogen is effectively removed from the vicinity of the gasifying char particle. Second, the gasification rate can be enhanced by the introduction of a potent catalyst for the gasification reaction via the bed material, which is then transferred onto the gasifying char and catalyzes the steam-carbon gasification reaction. This sequence of events has been demonstrated with a Manganese ore that contained Potassium as an effective catalyst for char gasification. Low-temperature gasification processes such as the DFB process commonly produce a raw gasification gas that is heterogeneous in its composition and that contains, among other contaminants, significant quantities of condensable and non-condensable hydrocarbons. Active <b>metal</b> oxide <b>bed</b> materials can therefore be employed in a hot gas conditioning process such as the CLR process for the purpose of conditioning the raw gasification gas by reforming tars and lighter hydrocarbons. In this work, a large number of transition metal oxides were screened as potential bed materials. Based on the screening results, two promising groups of bed materials for this application were developed. The first group, Cu-impregnated alumina materials, exhibited high degrees of ethylene conversion, but did not reform monoaromatic compounds. The second group, Fe,Sr-doped lanthanum zirconates, achieved high degrees of ethylene and benzene reforming while retaining methane in the gas. The benzene and ethylene conversion could be further improved by co-feeding O 2 with the gasification gas. A benzene conversion of up to 80 % and an ethylene conversion of about 95 % could be achieved at a temperature of 850 °C and at a rather high Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) of 6800 h- 1. Considering the expected lower costs and lower toxicity of this material compared to Precious metal- and Nickel-containing catalysts, these <b>metal</b> oxide <b>bed</b> materials are highly promising candidates for application in gasification gas conditioning with the CLR process, in particular when methane is the desired end-product...|$|R
