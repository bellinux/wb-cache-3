40|$|Nowadays, several organisations provide {{services}} on the Internet with similar functionality but different price and pricing schemes. Since these services {{are used in}} service compositions, the providers <b>of</b> composed <b>services</b> {{have to face the}} challenge <b>of</b> managing the <b>services</b> they use, in order to decrease the cost <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> compositions without compromising their quality. Several techniques to compute the cost <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions are currently available, but none of them take into account all classes of cost behaviour. This paper proposes an approach to service composition that consists of algorithms and an architecture to support the cost <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions by considering several classes of cost behaviour. We developed a prototype in order to evaluate our approach with experiments that show that it properly supports cost <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions throughout the service composition life-cycle. Our approach is quite promising as it is expected to dramatically improve the cost <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions...|$|R

50|$|In 1998, Deutsche Bahn hived off its {{night train}} services, which were {{provided}} with the train categories EN (EuroNight) and UEx (Urlaubsexpress), from DB Fernverkehr AG to DB AutoZug GmbH. One year later, the CityNightLine AG company, domiciled in Zurich and until then a joint venture operated by Deutsche Bahn and the state-owned railways of Austria and Switzerland, ÖBB and SBB, became a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Fernverkehr AG. It was run by the same management team as DB Autozug GmbH, so that responsibility for all night train categories, which still form the core element of the City Night Line network, lay with one single source from then on.

50|$|In May 2014, {{the federal}} Cabinet {{unanimously}} passed a new Public Procurement, Concessions and Disposal Act, which Finance Minister Halane had tabled. The law formalizes principles, procedures and decisions {{with regard to}} agreements entered into by public institutions, and procurement of goods, services and concessions with public funds. As such, it aims to spur economic development and establish a foundation for transparent financial governance by eliminating mismanagement of public funds, reducing monopolies and promoting competitiveness in the concession procurement process. The Act is expected to regulate the national public financial sector, ameliorate accountability, and ensure that public funds have been utilized {{in accordance with their}} intended purpose. Through sound price <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and commodities, it also aims to strengthen financial governance and institutions by optimizing values on public expenditures.

A report of the University of Karlsruhe in 1974 estimated the bridge’s remaining useful life as 10 to 15 years, provided that new corrosion protection was applied; this {{was carried out in}} 1978. Ten years later Deutsche Bundesbahn closed the line, after Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the owners of half the bridge, refused a request for an updated report on the bridge. This was followed in 1991 by extensive repair work, including local reinforcement measures and renewed anti-corrosion measures, allowing the maximum speed for passenger trains to be raised to 45 km/h and extending the bridge’s useful remaining life to 40 years. Until the electrification of the Waldshut-Koblenz gap in 1999, passenger services on the bridge were carried out by diesel multiple units of Deutsche Bahn. From 1999, SBB took over <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> on the bridge using electric multiple units.

50|$|The next social tier, or hierarchy, is the community. Historically, {{communities}} were tribes who shared social mores and cultural behavioral patterns. In contemporary urban settings communities are formed of diverse people. But {{these are people}} who share the common need to negotiate and manage their spatial settings. In plans created through the principles of intelligent urbanism these are called urban villages. Like a rural village, social bonds are found in the community management of security, common resources and social space. Urban villages will have defined social spaces, services and amenities that need to be managed by the community. According to proponents of intelligent urbanism these urban villages optimally become the administrative wards, and therefore the constituencies, of the elected members of municipal bodies. Though there are no physical barriers to these communities, they have their unique spatial social domain. Intelligent urbanism calls for the creation of dense, walkable zones in which the inhabitants recognize each other’s faces, share common facilities and resources, and often see each other at the village centre. This fifth tier of social space is where one needs initiative to join into various activities. It is intended to promote initiative and constructive community participation. There are opportunities for one {{to be involved in the}} <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> and amenities and to meet new people. They accommodate primary education and recreation areas. Good planning practice promotes the creation of community places, where community-based organizations can manage common resources and resolve common problems.|$|E
