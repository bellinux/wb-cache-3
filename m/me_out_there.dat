25|$|Me & Charles were at {{war from}} 1979 until 1999. He even {{threatened}} having bouncers {{on the doors}} of Medway Poet’s readings to keep <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were two camps in the Medway Poets from day one - me & Sexton versus everyone else. Bill came down on our side in the end. Rob Earl would have been with me & Sexton, but he wasn’t on the scene so much.|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|Saban {{engineered}} {{a number}} of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve Tensi from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was [...] "my responsibility to the team" [...] and what while the club made progress, [...] "my only regret is that {{we have not been able}} to give Denver a championship". Saban's record as Denver's coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that [...] "They're killin' <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> Whitey, they're killin' me!" [...] introduced Saban to a wider audience when it was aired by NFL Films.|$|E

I know he is; {{he said he}} would; {{and if he does}} aunty will die, for she loves it next to me; and I must save it, and--and, if you don't let me out--you'll be a murderer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|BEATRICE. When you let <b>me</b> go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{with mother}} I thought--I did think I would be able; and I had begun--and then--spring came! ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2001, {{he founded}} the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school {{dedicated}} to help youth progress in music, because of this. [...] "I just wanted {{to fill the void}} that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs", Flea laments, [...] "I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble {{and there are a lot}} of kids like <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got." [...] Flea felt the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art-related programs.|$|E
2500|$|... "In one {{championship}} with Crispa, walo lang kami (there {{were only}} eight of us), some were even fetched from the hospital. In those days, when your team only had seven players, you automatically lose by default. That {{was the fifth}} game, against Toyota. I didn't play the previous game but that night, I was a starter. In my entire basketball career, I never practiced as a point guard. Even in that particular game, Baby (Dalupan) did not tell me that I was starting as a point guard. He just sent <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> In the previous game, I noticed that Hubalde was playing forward. When he attracted a double-team, he'd swing the ball but {{the man at the}} top of the key couldn't deliver. Atoy Co couldn't get the ball because he was also well-covered. So the next game, the whole evening I was the point guard. We won the championship. I dominated the game. It was my show the whole evening. That's the kind of talent Baby has. Baby has some moves that would just change the face or the tempo of the game. I don't know where he got those ideas. Whoever thought I would be playing as a point guard?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mundine {{appeared}} in the music video of Angry Anderson's 1990 hit song [...] "Bound for Glory". In 2001 Mundine appeared as himself in the music video [...] "Like a Dog" [...] by the Australian rock group Powderfinger, whose frontman Bernard Fanning praised Mundine as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what}} the song is about and the fact that he's prepared to speak up for what he believes in." [...] In 2005 he featured in beatboxer Joel Turner's single [...] "Knock U Out". He then released his own debut single, [...] "Platinum Ryder", which also featured Nathan Merritt and Amos Roberts in the music video. The film clip created controversy for the burning of the Union Jack and a photo of then Prime Minister of Australia John Howard. Mundine also {{appeared in}} the Brothablack music video, Are You With <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>There,</b> along with league player Joe Williams. In 2008 Mundine featured in the video of a GetUp Mob version of the song From Little Things Big Things Grow. In 2009 Mundine also appeared alongside Shannon Noll in the Street Warriors debut album, Unstoppable Force. Mundine's album, entitled Dreams is yet to be released and there is currently no stated release date.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{remember}} now. I {{ran across}} him in British Columbia. We camped together one night. I'd {{never seen him}} before and I didn't see him again. He said he wanted a letter to old Pete for some reason, so I scribbled him one in pencil {{on the back of}} an envelope. I've never met any one who played a better game of draw poker. He cleaned <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There's</b> a lot in that fellow, in spite of his looking like a musical comedy dude. He's clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it be--nicer for you"--she faltered--"that is--it wouldn't be {{so lonely}} for you--would it--if--if you had <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{sounds to}} me!" [...] said the Kid, at last betraying interest. [...] "What'll the expressage {{be to take}} <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't mean {{to neglect}} me. Perhaps I was foolish, Stephen, but I felt you left <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were ways I could have helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabella recollected herself. [...] "As to that, {{my sweet}} Catherine, there cannot be a doubt, {{and you know}} me well enough {{to be sure that}} a much smaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should not have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There's</b> the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only think!" [...] says he, {{rubbing his}} hands in great spirits, [...] "I've been to the genteel villa residence, and the moment I {{mentioned}} my business they kicked <b>me</b> <b>out</b> directly. <b>There</b> were two witnesses of the assault, and it's worth a hundred pounds to me if it's worth a farthing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} ever meant to shoot. I {{think he was}} going to shut <b>me</b> up somewhere <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and keep <b>me</b> till I promised to be good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nice sort of nurse I am," [...] {{the former}} grumbled. [...] "It's all {{the fault of}} this man. He would keep <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> talking rubbish." ...|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Why wouldn't I say it? She's {{thinking}} {{of nothing but}} to get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> again to be wounded so that she may spend my pension, bad scran to her! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make it two tigers. I could chew {{holes in}} a steel door. What an ass {{you must have}} thought <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the garden. I see now you were {{laughing}} in your sleeve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm goin'," [...] replied Esther. [...] "You've no {{hold over}} me. My husband is dead. No one can stop <b>me.</b> I'm goin' <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to drive those hogs away an' bury him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, {{it may be}} a {{long story}} to you, but it was a short one to me, for it was the making of <b>me,</b> <b>out</b> of hand, <b>there</b> and then, blessed be God! But if you will have it--' ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the agent}} was thus recounting {{to his wife}} the day's doings, the evicted Tryst sat {{on the end of}} his bed in a ground-floor room of Tod's cottage. He had taken off his heavy boots, and his feet, in their thick, soiled socks, were thrust into a pair of Tod's carpet slippers. He sat without moving, {{precisely}} as if some one had struck him a blow in the centre of the forehead, {{and over and over again}} he turned the heavy thought: 'They've turned <b>me</b> <b>out</b> o' there--I done nothing, and they turned <b>me</b> <b>out</b> o' <b>there!</b> Blast them--they turned <b>me</b> <b>out</b> o' there!'...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I am here,' {{said the}} man. 'How it is I hardly know. I've come home, mother, because I {{was driven to}} it. Things were against <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and went from bad to worse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did. What {{were the}} laws to <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>there?</b> He {{had left me}} and had taken another wife. I {{had to do the}} best for myself. I did intend it. But I didn't do it. A woman can't be tried for her intentions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|No, I ca'n't face solitude, here, for long, said Arthur. But don't {{think about}} me. I {{have made up}} my mind to accept a post in India, that has been offered <b>me.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>there,</b> I suppose I shall find {{something}} to live for; I ca'n't see anything at present. 'This life of mine I guard, as God's high gift, from scathe and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You said--you said, {{you meant}} to marry me--just as if I had no {{voice in the}} matter! And that annoyed me, and made <b>me</b> go <b>there</b> <b>out</b> of curiosity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There it was, rising, falling! Music! Why did it so move {{one even}} when, as now, {{it was the}} voice of insult! And {{suddenly}} she thought: [...] "He will expect <b>me</b> to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> again and play for him. But I will not, never!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Preacher wanted <b>me</b> to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{and kill}} the referee, a {{distinguished}} gentleman named Bill McMasters.

6000|$|Sigmund {{stroked the}} dog meditatively. [...] "But I do {{think of the}} girl. And her eyes are blue like summer skies, and {{laughing}} like summer seas, and her hair is yellow, like mine, and braided in ropes {{the size of a}} big man's arms. She's waiting for <b>me,</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> in a better land. And she's waited long, and now my pile's in sight I'm not going to throw it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I was warden {{here for}} twelve years. Dear, dear, dear! If {{they had put}} any gentleman here that was not on {{friendly}} terms with me {{it would have made}} me very unhappy,--very. But, as it is, I go in and out just as I like; almost as much as I did before they-- But they didn't turn <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were reasons which made it best that I should resign." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{want you}} to be patient with me and hear <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> was a [...] time in the earlier part of this war when it was hard to be patient [...] because there hung over us the dread of losses and disaster.

Sitting [...] {{together}} as we do in spirit beside the mangled bodies of our dead, [...] surely we can be as patient as the hills.|$|E
6000|$|He smiled. [...] "If you {{can still}} feel shame, it shall {{overwhelm}} you ere I have done. For you shall hear <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> Here <b>there</b> are none to interrupt us, none to thwart my sovereign will. Reflect then, and remember. Remember what a pride you took in the change you had wrought in me. Your vanity welcomed that flattery, that tribute {{to the power of}} your beauty. Yet, all in a moment, upon the paltriest grounds, you believed me the murderer of your brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy did {{not catch}} the slip of tongue. She was {{flushing}} now.

6000|$|... "There, {{you have}} it now, Ailie, {{explained}} and illustrated," [...] cried Glynn, starting up. [...] "Here I am, at this minute in a snug, dry berth chatting to you, and in half a minute more I'll {{be out on the}} end o' the foreyard holding on for bare life, with the wind fit to tear off my jacket and blow my ducks into ribbons, and the rain and spray dashing all over me fit to blot <b>me</b> <b>out</b> altogether. <b>There's</b> a pretty little idea to turn over in your mind, Ailie, while I'm away." ...|$|R
