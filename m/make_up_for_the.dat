5|$|Middle-class {{families}} {{often use}} substitutes for domestic work to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lost time {{while working in}} the paid sector. They buy time taking care of children by using hired help and day-care centers. They also decrease the burden of paid work and unpaid work by using household appliances such as microwaves, laundry machines, and dishwashers, as well as buying pre-made food, eating out and using laundry services.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} between Super Fun 21 and traditional blackjack is that a blackjack only pays 6 to 5 instead of the traditional 3 to 2 payout. This more than <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> edge the casino is giving with the liberal rules variations above.|$|R

The bill was approved as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1902 on 18 November 1902.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's defense {{allowed the}} 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100yards per {{game on the}} ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team. The line was {{anchored}} by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, {{two of the three}} Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} of 22 May, United had a bye week from league play, which allowed the club to {{schedule}} a home friendly against the defending Dutch champions, AFC Ajax of Amsterdam. The previous week, Ajax had tallied a 3â€“1 win over Twente to secure the Dutch title for an unprecedented 30th time, their first since 2004. The Amsterdamers notched an early strike in the 10th minute thanks to forward, and Serbian international, Miralem Sulejmani. The Black-and-Red managed to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early setback thanks to a 58th-minute cross from Ngwenya to newly drafted Blake Brettschneider, leveling the match at one apiece. However, the match ended in Ajax's favor over United as the Amsterdammers tallied a final goal in the 87th minute courtesy of midfielder Vurnon Anita.|$|E

5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game industry from a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{eliminate}} many conventional weapons, {{and defend the}} Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that unless this occurred, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. In 1955, Khrushchev abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, Khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third {{in the size of}} Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.|$|E

50|$|The goat is {{efficient}} milking livestock for {{its relatively}} small size, producing an average yield of 3.16 kilograms of milk per day; this {{is less than}} most Swiss goats, but the milk's high butterfat and protein content (3.72% and 2.81%, respectively) <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> small yield.|$|R

5|$|Louis {{returned}} to Britain in May 1869. In June he joined HMS Royal Alfred, the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, becoming a midshipman in October. From June to September 1870 he took leave in Germany, {{coinciding with the}} Franco-Prussian war, but {{he spent the next}} three-and-a-half years in the Americas (Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia), where his tour of duty served to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the Ariadne. Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was posted to the shore establishment HMS Excellent, and passed the sub-lieutenant's examinationsâ€”gaining the best marks ever recorded at seamanship and joint best-ever at gunnery.|$|E

To <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover has no such error.|$|E

While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute â€“ chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E

The two Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton set the fastest times, with Rosberg being about three-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo was third, half a second down on Rosberg's 1:33.995 lap time. Kvyat in the other Red Bull {{did not have a}} good session, ending up {{eleventh}} fastest after running wide at both Spoon and the Degner corners.

5|$|The voter {{approval}} of Initiative 695 in 1999, which eliminated the motor vehicle excise tax used to fund ferry service, cut $93 {{million from the}} ferry system's budget {{by the end of}} 2001. Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a gas tax, led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction on eBay.|$|E
5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gatewayâ€“ although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrancesâ€“ and one or more portcullis.|$|E
