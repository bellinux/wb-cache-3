The legal order designed to regulate the use of the oceans is founded on the basic assumption that activities in the oceans do not require the appropriation of maritime areas by states, in particular, by coastal states. Accordingly, with the exception of internal waters, the recognition of 'sovereignty', 'sovereignty rights', and 'jurisdiction' over <b>maritime</b> <b>spaces</b> of coastal states does not imply the granting of exclusive powers over those spaces.

50|$|Previously a {{hereditary}} position, {{it is open}} to any eligible {{members as}} constituted in the latest 2000 Panglima Laôt convention. National political changes that gave wider local autonomy in Aceh provided opportunity to the Acehnese to apply local culture and, thus, recognise this customary system. Its role and position shifted from only Sultan’s bureaucrats to more independent civil representation. Internally, Panglima Laôt established local operational rules that should be complied with by the fisherman within his lhôk authority. Externally, Panglima Laôt represents their fishermen in resolving conflicts to fishermen from outside his lhôk territory, including conflict with foreign fisherman such as Thailand, India and Myanmar. The situation is beneficial to the application of such customary regime since the fishermen feel secure in doing their fishing activities. The government will also benefit from the system since the strong compliance will reduce their intervention in monitoring overexploitation of local marine resources. In addition, its power shifts following political changes and technology improvement. Previously represented Sultan’s power over <b>maritime</b> <b>space,</b> it becomes more independent in representing civil society. Its territory is also improving, from subsistent level to wider waters following the expansion of motorised fishing technology 8.|$|E

The term was first used in an article authored by Gurpreet Khurana, which was carried in the January 2007 issue of the Strategic Analysis journal (Routledge/ IDSA) titled [...] "Security of Sea Lines: Prospects for India-Japan Cooperation". In the article, the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ refers to the <b>maritime</b> <b>space</b> stretching from the littorals of East Africa and West Asia, across the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, to the littorals of East Asia. The spirit of the term {{was picked up by}} Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as reflected in his speech to the Indian Parliament in August 2007 that talked about the [...] "Confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans" [...] as [...] "the dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity" [...] in the [...] "broader Asia". From 2010 onwards, the term Indo-Pacific acquired salience within the Indian government and has since been used often by India's apex political leadership. From about 2011 onwards, the term has been used frequently by strategic analysts and high-level government/ military leadership in Australia, Japan and the US to denote the said region. However, a formal/ official documented articulation of the term first appeared in Australia’s Defence White Paper, 2013.|$|E
40|$|Island and <b>maritime</b> <b>spaces</b> between regions {{have become}} central places of {{recurrent}} crises over human migration and re-articulations of state sovereignty. Islands, the very sites where land meets water, {{are among the}} contested sites of struggle over entry and exclusion. In this paper, the Mediterranean is our main area of geographical inquiry. We explore the connections between crises of sovereignty, migration and islands, seeking to enhance connections between scholarship on migration and sovereignty. We argue that migration management and its geographical articulation on islands involve persistent reconfigurations of sovereignty, particularly evident during times of crisis over human migration. Such crises and re-articulations of sovereignty are creative uses of geography that repeatedly lead to a failure to protect human rights. To develop this argument, we bring feminist theorists of state sovereignty into conversation with political geographers. We move across scales of governance and political mobilization to show how a reconfiguration of sovereignty through regional and national management regimes leads to complex legal geographies and sovereign entanglements that migrants and advocates must navigate to claim rights...|$|R

This form of interpretation, according to which “the fact that a provision expressly provides for one category of situations is said to justify the inference that other comparable categories are excluded”, has been addressed several times in the jurisprudence of the Court and its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCIJ”). Yet, despite assertions that the maxim of interpretation would “find a place in the logic of the nursery”, there remain fundamental questions about both its character and its operation.

For example, in its notes verbales in 2011, the first phrase stated that China has undisputed sovereignty over the islands and the adjacent waters, suggesting China is claiming sovereignty over its territorial waters, a position consistent with UNCLOS. However, the second phrase in its notes verbales stated that China enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters along with the seabed and subsoil contained in this region, suggesting that China is claiming sovereignty over all of the <b>maritime</b> <b>space</b> (includes all the geographic features and the waters within the nine dash line). The third phrase indicates support for basing their claims on historical basis as well. Recently in its notes verbales in 2011, China has explicitly stated that it claims the territorial waters {{and all of the}} islands in which each island has its own exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. A major problem with this claim is that it fails to distinguish between geographic features considered as [...] "islands" [...] or [...] "rocks" [...] under UNCLOS. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claims based on historical claims are invalid. Many ambiguities arise from the notion of historical claims as a basis for claiming sovereignty and is inherently ambiguous.|$|E
