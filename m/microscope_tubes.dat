40|$|Instrument-oriented {{history of}} science in practice. A solar {{microscope}} by Kleman A solar microscope made by the Amsterdam instrumentmaker Jan Marten Kleman in 1796 is described. This particular instrument has several interesting features, such as the unusual construction of the opake projector and an additional <b>microscope</b> <b>tube</b> {{which was designed to}} be used with artificial light for either the examination or projection of opake objects. Comparison with another solar microscope by Kleman from the Wellcome Collection in the Science Museum (London) indicates that Kleman was partial to the production of versatile instruments. Thus the various pieces of his solar microscopes, supplemented with a few auxiliary parts, could also be assembled to serve as a microscope. This study of Kleman's solar microscopes serves as a steppingstone to a discussion of various aspects of instrument-oriented {{history of science}}. This particular approach to the history of science has focussed mainly on individual instruments, their makers, the trade in instruments, collectors and collections of scientific instruments and the evolution of specific kinds of instruments.

50|$|Vacuum {{is useful}} {{in a variety of}} {{processes}} and devices. Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make electron <b>microscopes</b> and vacuum <b>tubes</b> possible, including cathode ray tubes. Vacuum interrupters are used in electrical switchgear. Vacuum arc processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials. The elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges.|$|R

The adults can be distinguished from other Leptoceridae by the unbranched forewing M vein and the exceptionally long maxillary palps. In the Neotropical region, 55 species of Oecetis have been recorded {{and most of them}} can be placed in one of the six species groups known from this biogeographical region: the avara-, falicia-, inconspicua-, punctata-, punctipennis-, and testacea-groups. More than 50 % of the known diversity of Neotropical Oecetis has been described in the past 40 years. Here, we describe an additional 14 new species of Oecetis to further document the diversity of this genus in the Neotropical region. Methods The descriptions and illustrations presented here are based on male specimens. Specimens were collected with Malaise traps or ultraviolet light traps. They were preserved in alcohol or pinned as stated in material examined section. Specimens had their genitalia prepared in 85 % lactic acid to better observe internal characters and illustrations were aided by the use of a <b>microscope</b> with drawing <b>tube</b> attached. Results and Discussion This study raises the number of species of Oecetis in the Neotropics from 55 to 69.

As for the bile, the same tube was inserted into the bile duct. Then, 3 H-adriamycin (10. 79 µCi/ 0. 3 ml/ 300 µg adriamycin) was injected into the bladder. Following the instillation of the adriamycin over an one hour period, the filled bladder was excised. Thereafter the urine and bile were collected every 3 hours for the next 12 hours. In another group, the liver, spleen, kidney and heart were extirpated I and 12 hours after the injection, respectively. The following results were obtained. 1) The recovery rate of the residual 3 H-adriamycin in bladder one hour after instillation was 81. 7 % and the vesical tissue level was 175. 9 µg/g on an average. 2) The tissue concentrations of 3 H-adriamycin one hour after the injection were 0. 19 µg//g in the liver, 0. 36,ug/g in the spleen, 0. 31 µg/g in the kidney, and 0. 21 µg//g in the heart. 3) The recovery rate of 3 H-adriamycin into the urine was 0. 66 %, and the rate of it into bile was 4. 22 % during 12 hours. 4) The tissue concentrations of 3 H-adriamycin 12 hours after the injection were 0. 52 µg/g in the liver, 0. 67 µg/g in the spleen, 0. 49 µg/g in the kidney and 0. 33 µg/g in the heart.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, flow cytometry has been widely used as a {{powerful}} analysis tool for the diagnosis of many diseases due to its ability to count, characterize and sort cells. However, conventional flow cytometers are often bulky, expensive and complicated because sophisticated fluidic, electronic and optical systems are required to realize the functions of flow cytometry. The high cost and the complexity in operation and maintenance associated with flow cytometers {{as well as the}} large size have limited its use. In recent years, the rapid development of microfluidics-based lab-on-a-chip technology has created a new pathway for flow cytometry. Microfluidic devices allow for the integration of multiple liquid handling processes required in the diagnostic assays, such as pumping, metering, sampling, dispensing, sequential loading and washing. These lab-on-a-chip solutions have been recognized as an opportunity to bring portable, accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests to the flow cytometry. However, most current microfluidic flow cytometry devices are micro- only in the microfluidic chip, the rest of most apparatuses are still large and costly, usually involving <b>tubes,</b> <b>microscopes,</b> lasers and mechanical pumps. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel lab-on-a-chip system based on the electrokinetically-induced pressure-driven flow and dual-wavelength fluorescent detection, which lights a promising pathway for making a real portable, compact, low-cost microfluidic flow cytometry device. In this study, the core of this microfluidic system is the custom-designed PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchip. A novel method was applied to generate the electrokinetically-induced pressure-driven flow in a T-shaped microchannel using parameters settings that had been optimized by numerical study. This method combined both the electrokinetic pumping force and the pressure pumping force to eliminate their shortcomings associated with the use of each force alone. This is the fundamental of my study. By using this microchip, the size of the fluidic control subsystem is reduced significantly. Furthermore, the dual-wavelength fluorescent detection strategy is proposed in this thesis. On the optical detection side, excitation lights of two different wavelengths are provided by a single LED (light-emitting diode) from one side of the microchannel. Then the two emission lights are captured individually by two photo-detectors placed on the top and the bottom of the microchip. Compared with other microfluidic detection devices reported in the literatures that use lasers or PMTs (Photomultiplier tubes), this design allows for a significant reduction of 90 % in the volume and cost. As another important part of my thesis research, a novel flow focusing method that allows the hydrodynamic focusing in a T-shaped microchannel with two sheath flows is developed. This method solves the biggest obstacle which exists in current microfluidic flow cytometry devices. In this method, no external pumps, valves and tubing are involved in the system. Although substantial progress has been made in current microfluidic flow cytometry, there is still a need for a low-cost, compact, portable microfluidic devices, especially in low-resource settings as well as the developing world for POC (point-of-care) diagnosis and analysis. This thesis work has made a great achievement towards the final goal. 4 month...|$|R
