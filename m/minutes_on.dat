5|$|In May German forces {{attacked}} the Netherlands and Belgium which fell quickly. In June France collapsed. Fighter Command now needed {{an influx of}} pilots after losses in Western Europe. Finucane had improved and on 27 June 1940 he was posted to 7 Operational Training Unit (7 OTU) in Hawarden near Chester, to undergo conversion training onto Supermarine Spitfires while awaiting a fighter squadron posting. Finucane made his first flight in a Spitfire on 3 July 1940 and made 26 such flights in nine days. The pilots were tested on radio transmission, handling, formation flying and aerobatics. On 11 July 1940 he was permitted just one firing practice. At {{the end of his}} stay at 7 OTU he had logged 2 hours 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the Magister, 2 hours 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the Fairey Battle, 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the Hawker Hurricane and 22 hours and 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare was cut from 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years. In 1923, these lines came {{under the control of the}} Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT's successor company. Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during rush hours, but this quickly proved not to be true. In 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the Sea Beach Line and fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was being run on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during rush hours.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, BART {{had envisioned}} {{frequent}} local service, with headways {{as short as}} two minutes between trains on the quadruple-interlined section in San Francisco and six <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> each individual line.

While trains do arrive every three <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> the quadruple-interlined section between West Oakland and Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals.|$|E
