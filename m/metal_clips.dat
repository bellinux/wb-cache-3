2500|$|Albini [...] "sorta conned" [...] small local label Fever Records into {{financing}} the next Big Black EP, bringing in drummer Pat Byrne of Urge Overkill {{to play on}} the sessions as accompaniment to the drum machine, which they dubbed [...] "Roland" [...] for album credits. Albini achieved a signature [...] "clanky" [...] sound with his guitar by using metal guitar picks notched with sheet <b>metal</b> <b>clips,</b> creating the effect of two guitar picks at once. The Bulldozer EP was recorded with engineer Iain Burgess and released in December 1983, with the first two hundred copies packaged in a galvanized sheet metal sleeve in homage to Public Image Ltd.'s Metal Box. Many of the EP's lyrics depicted scenarios drawn from Albini's midwest upbringing, such as [...] "Cables", which described the slaughtering of cows at a Montana abattoir, and [...] "Pigeon Kill", about a rural Indiana town that dealt with an overpopulation of pigeons by feeding them poisoned corn.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a popular}} saying that the <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> {{on the side of}} the randoseru was used in the {{military}} to carry grenades. However, this is not true. The <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> was introduced in the past-World War II period, as a means to carry lunch boxes, change of clothes for P.E., etc.|$|R

5000|$|Front pocket wallet (or money clip): a {{case with}} no {{currency}} compartment {{and very few}} pockets for cards. Usually banknotes are folded and held to the wallet with a <b>metal</b> <b>clip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Advertising for the {{bindings}} {{appeared in}} 1970, and Rosemount boots featured the <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> that year. However, later designs from 1972 lack the clips and no further advertising can be found.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1960, Fender {{introduced}} a completely redesigned model 6G6 Bassman Amp, using the [...] "piggy-back" [...] design, {{in which the}} amplifier chassis is housed in a small cabinet, attached by <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> to a larger separate speaker enclosure.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent a}} joint from {{separating}} during a reaction process, {{various types of}} plastic or <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> or springs {{can be used to}} secure the two sides together. They are available in a variety of materials for different temperature and chemical environments.|$|E
50|$|A <b>metal</b> money <b>clip</b> is {{generally}} a solid {{piece of metal}} folded into half, such that the banknotes and credit cards are securely wedged in between the two pieces of <b>metal.</b> <b>Metal</b> money <b>clips</b> are typically made out of brass, stainless steel, silver, gold, titanium, or platinum. They are typically sold as luxury items. The chief disadvantage of a <b>metal</b> money <b>clip</b> is that, due to the inflexibility of the metal, it cannot typically hold large amounts of cash. Depending on the design, {{it may also be}} difficult to push the banknotes into the clip.|$|R
40|$|A case of cholangitis {{due to the}} {{migration}} of a <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> used for surgical cholecystectomy 4 years earlier, is reported. The diagnostic approach and therapeutic options, either endoscopic or surgical are discussed. The use of resorbable clips during the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy should avoid this type of complication...|$|R
50|$|A bicycle clip hat is a {{style of}} small hat or {{millinery}} decoration that includes a <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> - similar to traditional designs used by cyclists - {{to hold it in}} place. It may be very similar to a half hat or fascinator in design, covering only part of the head.|$|R
50|$|For {{situations}} where the simple spring action of metal wires or plastic is not strong enough or are not convenient for other reasons, screws {{can be used to}} hold joints together. Plastic collars are often used on microscale equipment. <b>Metal</b> <b>clips</b> with strong springs and screws to prevent release are used on larger joints that are subject to mechanical stress.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{he pleaded}} not guilty, {{claiming}} that Canada {{has no right}} to police people while they are outside its jurisdiction. Much of the evidence against him was videotapes that Bakker himself made. Some of these videos show Bakker torturing Vancouver area prostitutes with <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> and electric cords. Other videos show him having sex with girls in Cambodia, the oldest of whom was 12.|$|E
50|$|Some early 1900s battery holders {{were often}} {{no more than}} a {{cardboard}} box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, battery holders used twin <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> (like fuse holders) to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two spring arm clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.|$|E
25|$|Sam Browne VC was a British {{army officer}} serving in India in the 19th century. In those days {{officers}} always carried a sword into battle. It {{hung from a}} small <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> on the waistbelt, called a 'frog'. However, the scabbard tended to slide around a lot when they charged the enemy, meaning {{that it had to}} be steadied with the left hand before being drawn.|$|R
50|$|During {{this same}} period, the machine {{used to produce}} the <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> in the pencil’s unique ferrule and eraser system broke. At this time, Sanford was {{manufacturing}} roughly 1,100 gross of Blackwing 602 pencils a year. Because the volume was so low, {{the decision was made}} to cease production and sell through the remaining stock. The Eberhard Faber Blackwing 602 was officially discontinued in 1998.|$|R
50|$|A Terry clip (or Terry's clip) is {{a spring}} <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> {{used to hold}} a {{cylindrical}} object. For example, to secure a bicycle pump onto a bicycle frame. The object to be held is pushed into the clip to secure it, and pulled out to release. The original Terry clips were manufactured and sold by Herbert Terry & Sons Limited, Redditch, England (established in 1855).|$|R
50|$|The Kandahar version added had {{two small}} <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> {{on either side}} of the boot, {{normally}} near the instep or heel. For cross-country skiing the cable was left on top of the clips, allowing the heel to move vertically. For downhill runs, the cable was moved under the clips, forcing the heel down onto the ski. This provided greatly improved control, allowing the skier to torque the skis for turns.|$|E
50|$|The burning rushlight was {{normally}} held by <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> at {{an angle}} of about 45 degrees. If the rush is held vertically it tends to have a dimmer flame. If held horizontally it may burn too quickly. However, there were some devices designed to keep the burning rush in a vertical position, including nightlights made from cylinders of tin or sheet-iron perforated with holes {{that would allow the}} light to shine out.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, {{an elastic}} rubber or 'Pirelli' webbing became popular. This {{is made of}} black rubber, with an {{internal}} canvas reinforcement. This webbing is applied by hand and is not tensioned, the elasticity of the rubber being sufficient. It is attached by <b>metal</b> <b>clips,</b> fitting into grooves in the frame. As the webbing is elastic it is only used in parallel strips, rather than being interweaved: friction between these elastic webs moving over each other would soon abrade their edges.|$|E

25|$|The clip-on tie is a bow tie or four-in-hand tie {{which is}} {{permanently}} tied, with a dimple {{just below the}} knot, and which is fixed {{to the front of}} the shirt collar by a <b>metal</b> <b>clip.</b> Alternately, the tie may have a band around the neck fastened with a hook and eye. The clip-on tie was reportedly invented on December 13, 1928 in Clinton, Iowa, USA. The name of the inventor remains unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Clippers: Clippers for the {{production}} of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The filling product is taken from the vacuum filler and through a filling pipe connected to the clipper and an appropriate sausage casing brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b> Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced.|$|E
5000|$|Hannes Marker felt {{he could}} improve on the concept, and in 1953 he {{introduced}} the [...] "Duplex" [...] toe. The Duplex used two small wedge-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> that fit over the toe of the boot's sole, holding it down, and used a spring {{in order to keep}} the boot centred. During a fall, the clips could be forced outward against their centring springs, allowing it to release the toe. Like the Nevada, the Duplex used a cable binding for the heel.|$|E
5000|$|Major Accident's use of A Clockwork Orange {{imagery is}} also {{seen in the}} sleeve designs on their albums, with their early LPs, CDs and seven-inch singles using stark black and white imagery (though they began to include red after their 1996 reformation), and {{characters}} dressed in the Clockwork Orange style. Their final album in 1985 (before their reformation) ...Crazy! depicts {{a scene from the}} film, where the protagonist, Alex, is shown strapped into a laboratory chair, his eyes held open with <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel pressure pipe had chafed against a <b>metal</b> <b>clip,</b> causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot exhaust pipe. The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} 53 oil {{paintings in the}} archive. The collection includes various themes and subjects, though most depict scenes of rural Bengal. Besides the original paintings, there are 16 replicas, and 75 photographs on Zainul's life and works. There are also 69 mementos on display such as brushes, brush holder, bottles of turpentine and linseed oil, carbon box, charcoal, wax, colour palette, colour tube, easel, ink pot, leather portrait holder, <b>metal</b> <b>clip,</b> reed pen, scraper, spatula, and his spectacles. The mementos are situated in glass boxes {{in the midst of}} the gallery.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1989 Cleveland School massacre, the TEC-9 {{was placed}} on California's list of banned weapons. To {{circumvent}} this, Intratec rebranded {{a variant of the}} TEC-9 as a TEC-DC9 from 1990 to 1994 (DC standing for [...] "Designed for California"). The most noticeable external difference between the TEC-9 and the later TEC-DC9 is that rings to hold the sling were moved {{from the side of the}} gun with the cocking handle to a removable stamped <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> in the back of the gun. The TEC-9 and TEC-DC9 are otherwise identical.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{includes}} a 125,000 square meter terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly {{cut out of}} a mountain, with its east side leaning on Rahmet Mountain. The other three sides are formed by retaining walls, which vary in height with {{the slope of the}} ground. Rising from [...] on the west side was a double stair. From there, it gently slopes to the top. To create the level terrace, depressions were filled with soil and heavy rocks, which were joined together with <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inside the {{waistband}} holsters made by Alien Gear have adjustable belt clips, which allow {{the user to}} set the height the holster rides at inside {{the waistband}}, {{as well as the}} angle the pistol sits at by moving the belt clip between the weld nut position on the wings of the holster. Belt clips available from the company include standard plastic clips, <b>metal</b> <b>clips,</b> leather loops and also [...] "J" [...] and [...] "C" [...] clips, which tuck under the belt when being worn.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} {{cooling system}} {{is required to}} operate the tube at rated values. A centrifugal fan pressurizes the equipment chassis and provides a continuous stream of cooling air. A specially designed socket is used to direct the air over the filament and grid connections, and a glass chimney (Pyrex®) then directs the air around the tube's glass envelope; chassis-mounted <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> are used to center the chimney around the tube. Finally, a finned, cylindrical heat sink {{is attached to the}} anode connection (top of the tube) to provide additional cooling for the anode's glass-to-metal seal.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} case, an {{inappropriate}} placement {{angle of the}} clips resulted in the airway obstruction. The left main bronchus is located close beneath to the PDA and has a markedly thin wall of fragile cartilages in premature infants. A rigid <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> placed inappropriately on the PDA compresses and occludes the fragile airway easily. Surgeons should apply PDA clips carefully after considering their position, angle, and depth to avoid airway complications. In order to clip PDA without airway obstruction, surgeons should hold a clip vertically {{and apply it to}} the extreme aortic end of PDA.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of skiing the binding was also similar to those of a {{contemporary}} snowshoe, generally consisting of a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot. In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the toe strap was replaced by a <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> under the toe. This provided much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 Frank Mayfield and George Kees, {{a medical}} illustrator, develop the Mayfield clip and clip applier, {{to shut off}} the blood supply to a brain aneurysm. Mayfield had the idea to develop a small, cross-legged clip and an {{applicator}} with tweezers-like dexterity to permit for trial-and-error placement of the clip across the neck of an aneurysm. The <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> {{would have to be}} malleable enough so that it could be twisted into shape and still retain its spring recoil. If, after placement, the clip had to be removed, it could be accomplished by using the forceps as if it were tweezers.|$|R
