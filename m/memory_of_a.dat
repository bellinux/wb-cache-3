5|$|In the song, {{the protagonist}} kisses {{different}} lips {{looking for new}} sensations, haunted by the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on his album Romance released in 1991. This version peaked {{at the top of}} the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart in the United States, and the album was deemed as responsible for reviving the bolero genre.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{recorded}} seven 17th and 18th century memorials within the church, {{the oldest in}} <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Thomas Owen who died in 1646. The tombs in the churchyard include one of a Sidney Griffith (died 1618) and more than 20 others from the 17th and 18th centuries. The survey also noted some oak dog tongs, likely {{to be from the}} 19th century, and three 17th-century chairs.|$|E
5|$|Eric Church {{wrote the}} song with Jeff Hyde and Ryan Tyndell. The {{basis for the}} song came from a <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> girl and {{involved}} another artist's song. Church chose to base the song around an idol of his, Bruce Springsteen, whose career he admires. During {{the course of the}} song, Church makes several allusions to Springsteen; he mentions the Springsteen songs Born to Run, Born in the USA, Glory Days, and I'm on Fire. While being named after Springsteen and making several references to him, the song however {{tells the story of a}} teenage romance.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|The in-game {{characters}} {{are taken from}} the Wii's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii (a customized avatar) that can be imported into games that support the feature. Wii Sports is the first Wii title to use this feature. Miis saved on the Wii {{will appear in the}} crowd during bowling games and as members of human-controlled teams in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.|$|E
5|$|During a {{fundraising}} {{event in}} Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy {{was performed by}} various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, {{who were killed in}} a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.|$|E

5|$|Gyula Kristó {{and many}} other historians refute Porphyrogenitus's report of the {{omission}} of Álmos in favor of his son, saying that the turul legend connected to Álmos's birth proves his role as forefather of his dynasty. These historians say that the emperor's account {{is based on a}} report by one of Árpád's descendants named Termacsu, who emphasized by this report of Árpád's election that only those descending from Árpád were suitable to lead the Hungarians; other children of Álmos were excluded. András Róna-Tas says that Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coup d'état organized against Levedi kende by Álmos gyula, who had his own son Árpád elected as sacred ruler in his opponent's place. A late 9th-century Central Asian scholar, Abu Abdallah al-Jayhaniwhose works were partially preserved in Ibn Rusta's and other Muslim authors' booksmentions the existence of these two high offices among the Hungarians. He describes the kende as the Hungarians' sacred ruler and the gyula as their military commander. Historians still debate which of the two offices was held by Álmos.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge {{to head for the}} Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E

5|$|The 19th century also {{witnessed}} {{two major}} restorations to St Denys'. As the congregation expanded, {{the need for}} greater space was met {{with the addition of}} a new north aisle in 1853. This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £3,500 by Kirk and Parry, which included the demolition of the galleries, the addition of a strainer arch and the relocation of the organ. The church was damaged by an electrical storm in 1884 and parts, including the stone broach spire—one of the oldest in England—were rebuilt by Kirk and Parry in 1885–86. The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local solicitor, Henry Snow, in 1906. Electric lighting was introduced in 1951–53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966, when the organ was rebuilt, and in 1988. Fifty-four solar panels were added in 2008, at the cost of £70,000, and by 2011 were able to cover the church's electricity bill.|$|E
5|$|The Era of Martyrs (Latin: anno martyrum or AM), {{also known}} as the Diocletian era (Latin: anno Diocletiani), is a method of {{numbering}} years used by the Church of Alexandria beginning in the 4th century anno Domini and by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the epoch, making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; Dionysius Exiguus replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his anno Domini era because he did not wish to continue the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tyrant who persecuted Christians. The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the west window dates from 1875; it was made by Clayton and Bell and depicts the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Also by Clayton and Bell is a window at {{the west end of}} the north wall of the nave {{depicting}} Enoch, Noah, Job and Abel. To the east of this is a window designed by Michael Farrar-Bell dated 1985, to the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local farmer, depicting the Creation. Beyond this is a window from 1901 made by Reuben Bennett which depicts the Good Shepherd with David and Miriam. On the south wall of the nave is a window from 1919 by Harry Clarke depicting Richard Coeur-de-Lion, saints and military emblems. In other windows on the south wall there are fragments of old glass. The north wall of the north transept contains a window with stained glass by Kempe which incorporates some pieces of medieval glass and depicts the Tree of Jesse. On the east wall of the transept are two windows by John Hardman which date from 1862 and 1864. The south transept contains a window dating from 1855 with stained glass by William Wailes. The east window was reglazed in 1876 by Clayton and Bell; it shows episodes from the life of Christ with figures of apostles and prophets. In the porch is more stained glass by Kempe, dating from 1878.|$|E
