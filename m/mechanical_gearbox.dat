25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox</b> which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

50|$|Conventional rotary-wing {{aircraft}} use {{a set of}} complex <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> to convert the high rotation speed of gas turbines into the low speed required to drive main and tail rotors. Unlike powerplants, <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> cannot be duplicated (for redundancy) and {{have always been a}} major weak point in helicopter reliability. In-flight catastrophic gear failures often result in gearbox jamming and subsequent fatalities, whereas loss of lubrication can trigger onboard fire. Another weakness of <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> is their transient power limitation, due to structural fatigue limits. Recent EASA studies point to engines and transmissions as prime cause of crashes just after pilot errors.|$|R

5000|$|The Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric bus is {{interesting}} {{as an early}} example of a hybrid vehicle, although without any direct engine propulsion or battery storage. As the petrol engine ran continuously and its chassis weight with a large, heavy motor/dynamo pair was much higher than a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox,</b> it was less fuel efficient than a competing mechanical transmission chassis type. Once <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox</b> transmissions were developed enough to become reliable, quiet and easy enough to use, this inefficiency contributed to its demise. Another reason was the simple and fairly inefficient electrical control system, the best that could be achieved {{in the absence of}} [...] "modern" [...] electronics. However hybrid petrol-electric cars, such as the Toyota Prius, are now seen as being a partial solution towards cutting carbon dioxide emissions and reducing the risks of damaging global warming.|$|E

5000|$|Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers {{are more}} {{tolerant}} of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular [...] "freshening" [...] cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip {{around the top of}} the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.|$|R

50|$|Both {{variants}} {{of the design}} (DB 690 'CargoSprinter' and DB 691 'Talion') are five-car trains, with a control cabin at either end. The end cars are powered, with the inner axles individually driven by Volvo engines (6 cylinder, 265 kW @ 2050rpm, emissions to Euro stage II standards). The transmission system uses a (5-speed) <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox</b> with clutch, torque converter, and retarder. Fuel capacity is 700l.

50|$|A {{constant}} speed drive (CSD) is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox</b> that takes {{an input shaft}} rotating at {{a wide range of}} speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a {{constant speed}}, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators, that require a constant input speed. Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines. Constant-speed drives are usually found supplying accessory equipment and are rarely needed for an engine's main power output.|$|E

40|$|Through case histories, {{this paper}} will present how current {{signature}} analysis can reliably diagnose rotor winding problems in induction motors. Traditional CSA measurements can result in misdiagnosis and/or false alarms of healthy machines due {{to the presence of}} current frequency components in the stator current caused by non-rotor related conditions such-as <b>mechanical</b> load fluctuations, <b>gearboxes,</b> etc. Through theoretical advancements, it is now possible to predict many of these components, therefore making CSA testing a technology that is much more robust and less error prone. Based on these theoretical developments, case histories are presented which present the ability to secede current components resulting from <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> from those ensuing broken rotor bars. A new hand held instrument for reliable detection of broken rotor bars, air gap eccentricity, and mechanical phenomena/problems in induction motor drives is being developed from this data. Recognition of the start of these problems preceding failure facilitates corrective action to be carried out therefore avoiding the significant costs associated with unexplained down time due to unexpected failures...|$|R

50|$|The T-14 has a 12-speed {{automatic}} gearbox, with a {{top speed}} of 80-90 km/h and a range of 500 km. At least one expert speculated that the transmission might be an electronically controlled <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox</b> with external reverse and demultiplier gears, giving the tank equal forward and reverse gear ranges. Other sources suggest a partly or fully hydrostatic transmission. Uniquely for a Soviet/Russian design, the transmission is joined with the engine into a single unit that can be swapped out in the field in just under 30 minutes(source?).|$|E
50|$|Electric {{drive is}} almost {{universal}} because a railroad locomotive {{is a difficult}} environment for a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearbox,</b> as the loads vary widely from second to second as the slack action runs in and out. Only on very small locomotives, pulling {{a limited number of}} cars, generally on level track, have there been any successful gearbox locomotive drives. In the case of Locomotive 1, the four-speed gearbox drives a jackshaft under the cab which is connected with side rods to the two driving wheels. The choice of mechanical drive may also have been driven by war availability - a generator and traction motor take hundreds of pounds of copper, which was scarce.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines have eclipsed {{steam engines}} {{as the prime}} mover on all non-electrified railroads in the industrialized world. The first diesel {{locomotives}} appeared in the early 20th century, and diesel multiple units soon after. While electric locomotives have replaced the diesel locomotive for some passenger traffic in Europe and Asia, diesel is still today very popular for cargo-hauling freight trains and on tracks where electrification is not feasible. Most modern diesel locomotives are actually diesel-electric locomotives: the diesel engine is used to power an electric generator that in turn powers electric traction motors with no mechanical connection between diesel engine and traction. After 2000, environmental requirements has caused higher development cost for engines, {{and it has become}} common for passenger multiple units to use engines and automatic <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes</b> made for trucks. Up to four such combinations might be used to achieve enough power in a train.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the modeling {{of a new}} type of electromechanical converter with rolling rotor (ECRR) in order to obtain an optimisation at functional level. The ECRR prototype comprises a stator composed of twelve magnetic poles and a disk-shaped rolling rotor made of ferromagnetic material, without windings. Each magnetic pole is made of an E-shaped magnetic system and a winding placed on its central column. The electromechanical converter with rolling rotor is analyzed through a magnetic field study with Flux 2 D software in magnetostatic application. The field study examines the influence of the rotor thickness, axial air-gap size and current density on the magnetic attraction force that changes the position of the disk-shaped rolling rotor. Also, it is analyzed the variation of the magnetic attraction force for different inclination angles of the rolling rotor. The main advantage of the ECRR is represented by a low rotational speed without using <b>mechanical</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> The ECRR prototype can be used in photovoltaic panels tracking systems...|$|R
