Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a [...] "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [...] paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After he was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, his <b>medical</b> <b>proxy</b> at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, which caused their relationship to end.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Euphoria, Part 1", Foreman became {{infected}} with a mysterious illness. Another patient, {{infected with the}} same condition, experiences a very painful death in front of Foreman. In {{the conclusion of the}} episode, Cameron, acting as Foreman's <b>medical</b> <b>proxy,</b> performs a white-matter brain biopsy and the condition is revealed to be primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria, a water-borne parasite that, upon being inhaled, attacks the brain. After treatment, it appears Foreman is cured of the meningoencephalitis, but something may have gone wrong during the biopsy. Although his brain had some confusion between the left and right side of the brain, he is in recovery. Upon his return from recovery, Foreman's memory seemed to have been impaired, as he struggled to remember key medical concepts (see [...] "Forever") and could not remember how to make coffee. In the next two episodes, however, he seems to be able to once again keep up with his fellow doctors when coming up with medical theories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Problems {{associated}} with aging include Alzheimer’s disease. Cognitive deficits are {{important parts of}} the disease. Many elders want to continue their normal lives even when sick. An Activity of Daily Living (ADL) sometimes requires external help since the elder may not have all the resources (physical and cognitive) to complete an activity. The Intelligent Health Home (IHH) assists the elderly in their ADL through its residence and apparatuses. This paper describes the services that we plan to offer through the IHH. These services are {{the core of the}} software architecture that will give the framework of the IHH system. The system is used by the resident and other actors, such as a <b>medical</b> staff, <b>proxies</b> and technicians. Additional services must be added to the framework to support these actors. The description of the services through a software architecture is then schematised...|$|R
40|$|Reliance on self-rated {{health to}} <b>proxy</b> <b>medical</b> need can bias {{estimation}} of education-related inequity {{in health care}} utilisation. We correct this bias both by instrumenting self-rated health with objective health indicators and by purging self-rated health of reporting heterogeneity identified from health vignettes. Using data on elderly Europeans, we find that instrumenting self-rated health shifts the distribution of doctor visits {{in the direction of}} inequality favouring the better educated. There is a further, and typically larger, shift the same direction when correction is made for the tendency of the better educated to rate their health more negatively. health care, health, equity, reporting heterogeneity, vignettes...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{after he}} was put into a {{chemically}} induced coma to sleep through {{the worst of the}} pain, Stacy, House's <b>medical</b> <b>proxy,</b> and Dr. Lisa Cuddy who was House's doctor at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision after he obviously didn't want it and this was eventually the reason Stacy left him. House now suffers chronic pain in his thigh and uses a cane (which he uses for more than walking, he sometimes likes to use it for protection or to push aside privacy curtains, or knocking on doors) to aid his walking. He also frequently takes Vicodin, a moderate to severe painkiller to relieve his pain. House does however break his dependency with psychiatric help, after he suffers a psychotic break. When Warner makes her first appearance in season 1, she is married to a high school guidance counselor named Mark Warner. Although she and House have a brief, intimate encounter during the second season, House eventually tells Stacy to go back to her husband, devastating her. In the season two finale [...] "No Reason" [...] one of House's former patients shoots him twice.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{concomitant}} alcoholism {{is widely}} be-lieved to enhance liver disease progression in persons with hep-atitis C virus (HCV) infection, this relationship {{has not been}} well quantified. Objective: To quantify the relationship of transfusion-associated HCV infection and history of heavy alcohol abuse to development of cirrhosis. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Liver clinics in university and government hospitals. Patients: Extended follow-up of 1030 patients in prospective investigations of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis conducted in the United States between 1968 and 1980.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} ICF items indicating health problems for patients with a chronic neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and neuromuscular disease. Method. A Delphi study using three disease-specific panels composed of patients and <b>proxies,</b> <b>medical</b> and non-medical health professionals (N= 98). Panels were asked to select items from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) reflecting relevant disease-specific health problems. Items appraised as relevant by the panel members were compared with items in established measures namely: the Minimal Record of Disability (MRD) and the Disability and Impact Profile (DIP). Results. Sixty-eight ICF items were considered to be the most relevant, and belonged to four ICF domains. No significant differences were found between the appraisal of items by patients/proxies and health professionals. Agreement across the disease panels appeared to be (very) strong. Differences between the three disease-specific panels were found for the 'Body Functions and Structures' domain: consensus was reached by extension of the inclusion criteria. The ICF-item selection covers almost all items of the established measures. The largest contrast was shown in the item selection for the 'participation' and 'environmental factors' domains. Conclusions. Selected items indicate a broader scope in studying health problems compared with widely used health status measures in neurology, especially for the ICF domains 'Participation' and 'Environmental Factors'...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} limited {{research}} on understanding the educational implications for young people with intermittent hearing impairment resulting from Glue Ear (Otitis Media). Increasingly, there is recognition that it can have longer term academic and social implications (Wilson 2009). It tends to be constructed as a temporary situation curable through grommet surgery {{so much of the}} research has been conducted from a <b>medical</b> perspective. Parental <b>proxies</b> have previously been the main way of identifying its impact on young people. However, we provided the opportunity for young people to use their own voices. In this paper we use an example of the different interpretations by a mother and her son of the same educational and social situations. This demonstrates that when they are asked directly, young people can evaluate the best way for educators to support them. Each research participant was asked to independently create a photomontage of images illustrating how Glue Ear affected them. The Photovoice methodology was adapted for use with individuals, rather than through the more usual group approach. It was combined with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to give depth to the data analysis. We conclude that there is an urgent need for more research into the ways in which educators can encourage young people with this condition to express their needs to ensure they achieve their full potential...|$|R
40|$|The Mental Capacity Act 2005 has {{provided}} unified scope in the British <b>medical</b> system for <b>proxy</b> consent {{with regard to}} medical decisions, {{in the form of}} a lasting power of attorney. While the intentions are to increase the autonomous decision making powers of those unable to consent, the author of this paper argues that the whole notion of proxy consent collapses into a paternalistic judgement regarding the other person's best interests and that the new legislation introduces only an advisor, not a proxy with the moral authority to make treatment decisions on behalf of another. The criticism is threefold. First, there is good empirical evidence that people are poor proxy decision makers as regards accurately representing other people's desires and wishes, and this is therefore a pragmatically inadequate method of gaining consent. Second, philosophical theory explaining how we represent other people's thought processes indicates that we are unlikely ever to achieve accurate simulations of others' wishes in making a proxy decision. Third, even if we could accurately simulate other people's beliefs and wishes, the current construction of proxy consent in the Mental Capacity Act means that it has no significant ethical authority to match that of autonomous decision making. Instead, it is governed by a professional, paternalistic, best‐interests judgement that undermines the intended role of a proxy decision maker. The author argues in favour of clearly adopting the paternalistic best‐interests option and viewing the proxy as solely an advisor to the professional medical team in helping make best‐interests judgements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} liberal tenats that justify {{intervention}} {{to promote the}} welfare of an incompetent do not suffice {{as a basis for}} analyzing parent-child relationships, and that this inadequacy is the basis for many of the problems that arise when thinking about the state's role in resolving family conflicts, particularly when monitoring parental discretion in medical decision-making on behalf of a child. The state may be limited by the best interest criterion when dealing with children, but parents are not. The state's relation with the child is formal while the parental relation is intimate, having its own goals and purposes. While the liberal canons insist on the incompetent one's best interest, parents are permitted to compromise the child's interests for ends related to these familial goals and purposes. Parents decisions should be supervened, in general, only if it can be shown that no responsible mode of thinking warrants such treatment of a child. Key Words: <b>proxy</b> <b>medical</b> consent, children's rights, state's protection of child-ren, parental authority and the state's intervention, paternalism, liberalism and parental values. Thinking about families raises a dilemma for those enamored of a liberal social and moral philosophy. It has been well argued in the literature on the family that in a society committed to distribution based in large part on merit, respect for the autonomy of the family interferes with efforts to provide effective equal opportunities for children, and hence for the adults into which those children mature (Fishkin, 1982; Blustein, 1982). What I shall concern myself with here are some reasons for puzzling over liberalism from the perspec-tive of the parent-child relationship. I will argue that liberal tenets do not suffice as a basis for analyzing parent-child relationships...|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{examined}} {{the risk of}} disability pension before and after ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke event, the burden of stroke compared with IHD and which factors predicted disability pension after either event. Design A population-based cohort study with follow-up 5 years {{before and after the}} event. Register data were analysed with general linear modelling with binary and Poisson distributions including interaction tests for event type (IHD/stroke). Setting and participants All people living in Sweden, aged 25 - 60 years at the first event year, who had been living in Sweden for 5 years before the event and had no indication of IHD or stroke prior to the index event in 2006 - 2008 were included, except for cases in which death occurred within 30 days of the event. People with both IHD and stroke were excluded, resulting in 18 480 cases of IHD (65 %) and 9750 stroke cases (35 %). Primary outcome measures Disability pension. Results Of those going to suffer IHD or stroke event, 25 % were already on disability pension a year before the event. The adjusted OR for disability pension at first postevent year was 2. 64 -fold (95 % CI 2. 25 to 3. 11) for people with stroke compared with IHD. Economic inactivity predicted disability pension regardless of event type (OR= 3. 40; 95 % CI 2. 85 to 4. 04). Comorbid mental disorder was associated with the greatest risk (OR= 3. 60; 95 % CI 2. 69 to 4. 83) after an IHD event. Regarding stroke, <b>medical</b> procedure, a <b>proxy</b> for event severity, was the largest contributor (OR= 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 43 to 3. 60). Conclusions While IHD event was more common, stroke involved more permanent work disability. Demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity-related factors were associated with disability pension {{both before and after the}} event. The results help occupational and other healthcare professionals to identify vulnerable groups at risk for permanent labour market exclusion after such an event...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the differences in}} functional outcomes attributable to discharge to one of four different venues for post-hospital care for each of five different types of illness associated with post-hospital care: stroke, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hip procedures, and hip fracture, and to {{estimate the}} costs and benefits associated with discharge to the type of care that was estimated to produce the greatest improvement. STUDY SETTING/DATA SOURCES: Consecutive patients with any of the target diagnoses were enrolled from 52 hospitals in three cities. Data sources included interviews with patients or their <b>proxies,</b> <b>medical</b> record reviews, and the Medicare Automated Data Retrieval System. ANALYSIS: A two-stage regression model looked first at the factors associated with discharge to each type of post-hospital care and then at the outcomes associated with each location. An instrumental variables technique was used to adjust for selection bias. A predictive model was created for each patient to estimate how that person would have fared had she or he been discharged to each type of care. The optimal discharge location was determined as that which produced the greatest improvement in function after adjusting for patients' baseline characteristics. The costs of discharge to the optimal type of care was based on the differences in mean costs for each location. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were collected from patients or their proxies at discharge from hospital and at three post-discharge follow-up times: six weeks, six months, and one year. In addition, the medical records for each participant were abstracted by trained abstractors, using a modification of the Medisgroups method, and Medicare data were summarized for the years before and after the hospitalization. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In general, patients discharged to nursing homes fared worst and those sent home with home health care or to rehabilitation did best. Because the cost of rehabilitation is high, greater use of home care could result in improved outcomes at modest or no additional cost. CONCLUSIONS: Better decisions about where to discharge patients could improve the course of many patients. It is possible to save money by making wiser discharge planning decisions. Nursing homes are generally associated with poorer outcomes and higher costs than the other post-hospital care modalities...|$|R
