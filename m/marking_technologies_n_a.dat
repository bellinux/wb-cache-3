40|$|The {{impact of}} {{hydrothermal}} treatment {{of rice and}} corn flours on their potential as gluten free bakery improvers was tested. Hydrothermal treatment of flours {{was carried out by}} suspending flours in water on the basis of 5 / 1 (w/w) and heated until 65 °C. Corn or rice semolina supplemented by field bean semolina in ratio of 2 / 1 (w/w) were used for obtaining protein enriched gluten free breads, where improvers functionality was tested. Two central composite designs involving water hydration levels (X 1, X′ 1) and the level of hydrothermally treated rice or corn flours (X 2, X′ 2) were used. Instrumental analyses of breads (specific volume, moisture content, crumb texture and height/width ratio) were carried out {{to assess the impact of}} experimental factors. Results showed that hydrothermal treatment of rice or corn flours affected in different extent the bread properties, increasing the specific volume of breads and H/W ratio, and decreasing the hardness and chewiness of both types of breads. The optimum formulation for rice/field bean bread contained 7. 59 g/ 100 g treated rice flour and 96. 66 g/ 100 g water, and for corn/field bean bread the optimum included 4. 73 g/ 100 g treated corn and 78. 81 g/ 100 g water. Optimized breads were found acceptable according to color and texture structure.

40|$|We {{consider}} two {{resource allocation}} problems where one dimensional mechanisms achieve allocative efficiency in equilibrium under quasi-linear preferences, but {{are unable to}} balance the budget. We define the efficiency loss of a mechanism as its largest ratio of budget imbalance to efficient surplus, over all profiles of individual preferences. We look for mechanisms minimizing the efficiency loss. To assign one (desirable or undesirable) object among n agents, we find a subsidy-free VCG mechanism guaranteeing voluntary participation and an efficiency loss of 2 n/ 2 n. This mechanism is optimal in the VCG class, and among all strategy-proof mechanisms treating equals equally. The result generalizes partially to the assignment of multiple identical objects, where the optimal mechanism {{is no longer a}} VCG one, and the tradeoff between voluntary participation and minimizing the efficiency loss can be severe. To exploit a one input-one output convex <b>technology,</b> <b>n</b> users request <b>a</b> quantity of output and the mechanism assigns cost shares. In the canonical residual * mechanism, total surplus is maximized in any Nash equilibrium of a natural potential game. Total payment may differ from the actual cost and a user with a null demand may be subsidized. If the cost function is totally monotone (e. g., polynomial with positive coefficients, or exponential), participation is voluntary and total payment covers at least actual cost. The efficiency loss is at most min{ 2 /log n, 1 }. For power cost functions, C(a) =a p, p> 1, the above ratio converges to zero as 1 /n p- 1. Participation appears to be voluntary however a small budget deficit is possible. These properties are lost if the cost function is not smooth...|$|R

A neotype series is designated for A. investigata Friauf & Edney. The phylogenetic relationships between 24 species of the Corydiid cockroach genus Arenivaga were investigated using morphological and molecular data. The molecular dataset included the following markers: the nuclear gene histone III (H 3), the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene 12 S (12 S), and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (CO 1). The phylogenetic relationships of these 24 species were then explored using three optimality criteria: parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The putative sister genus Eremoblatta and more distantly related Blatta orientalis were used as outgroups. A partitioned Bremer analysis was performed to provide some insight into which portions of the data provided the most evolutionary insight into this unusual group of insects. All analyses confirm the genus is monophyletic. Several relationships within the genus are recovered with strong support. Both the parsimony and likelihood estimations fail to provide good resolution along {{the backbone of the}} generic tree, whereas the Bayesian estimation resolves most nodes. Most of the strongly supported relationships are reinforced by both geographical distribution and genital morphology. The relative contributions of 23 ecological variables to the niche of the genus Arenivaga were examined. This analysis revealed that more than 95 % of their ecological niche could be described by eight variables: soil, isothermality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the driest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation of the wettest quarter and ground cover. These eight variables with respect to their relative contributions to the niche of the genus as a whole as well as the individual niches of 27 species in the genus were then examined. This revealed the similarity of niche composition of most of the species, as well as how varied the niches were of several species. A species dendrogram built from similarity of contribution of the eight variables to niche composition was compared to a phylogeny of the genus, but few similarities in topology were found. This analysis revealed that soil is the most important contributor to these species’ niches, followed by precipitation of the driest month, and finally, precipitation of the wettest quarter. It also confirmed that the majority of Arenivaga species have niches comprised of similar, but not identical, proportions of as few as four, and as many as eight ecological variables. Currently {{there is no evidence to}} support niche conservatism between closely related species, indicating that adapting to new and variable niches is one of the drivers of speciation in this genus.
