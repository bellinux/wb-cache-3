40|$|Taking {{insights}} from the domestic work literature both locally and internationally, this study explores the lived experiences of <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> who work as cleaners in the students’ residences at Rhodes University.

Data was generated from in-depth individual interviews and focus groups with 26 women and 3 men participants (aged between 28 and 60) who work as <b>room</b> <b>attendants,</b> and who were recruited from the residences across the university. The phenomenological approach allowed the participants to articulate in-depth, their experiences of working as <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> in intimate spaces. This study used a triangulated conceptual framework, which amalgamated the concepts of pain, social space and intersectionality, and exploitation under the umbrella concept of positional suffering.

40|$|Hotel <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> play a {{significant}} role in the overall performance and success of hotels. This study presents women room attendants' perspectives of working in what they perceive is the lowest level of a hotel's operational hierarchy, and their experience of the power relationships inherent in these bureaucratic structures. A qualitative, constructionist grounded theory methodology was used, underpinned by a socialist-feminist, critical theory epistemology. Interviews were conducted with 46 <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> from five 'five-star' hotels on the Gold Coast region of South East Queensland, Australia. Emerging from this study was the conceptualization of women room attendants' daily work experiences at the lowest level of the operational hierarchy. Despite their conspicuous presence, women <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> perceive themselves as near invisible through non-acknowledgement by hotel management and other staff due to their position at the lowest level of the operational hierarchy. This article contributes to theoretical research on employment experiences in hospitality, particularly on hotel operational praxis and methodologically presents the perceptions of women <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> through embodiment of their particular voices.

40|$|In video based cross-model {{analysis}} of planning meeting, the meeting events are recorded by multiple cameras {{distributed in the}} entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> Subject’s hand gestures, hand motion, head orientations, gaze targets, body poses are {{very important for the}} meeting event analysis. In order to register everything to the same global coordinate system, build 3 D model, get 3 D data from the video, we need to create a proper <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration and calibrate all cameras to obtain their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. However, the calibration of multiple cameras distributed in the entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> area is a challenging task because it is impossible to let all cameras in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> see a reference object {{at the same time and}} wide field-of-view cameras suffer under radial distortion. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to create a good <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration and calibrate multiple cameras in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> The proposed approach includes several steps. First, we create stereo camera pairs according to the room configuration and the requirements of the targets, the participants of the meeting. Second, we apply Tsai’s algorithm to calibrate each stereo camera pair and obtain the parameters in its own local coordinate system. Third, we use Vicon motion capture data to transfer all local coordinate systems of stereo camera pairs into a global coordinate system in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> We can obtain the positions, orientations, and parameters for all cameras in the same global coordinate system, so that we can register everything into this global coordinate system. Next, we do calibration error analysis for the current camera and <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration. We can obtain error distribution in the entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> area. Finally, we improve the current camera and <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration according to the error dis...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} women room attendants' {{experiences of}} the consequences of distinction work in five five-star hotels located in the Gold Coast region of South East Queensland, Australia. Those consequences are demonstrations of deference, reification of lower social class standing and social ostracism. 'Distinction work' requires attendants to recognize the guest's superior class position as a key part of service interactions. An ontologically intertwined research stance was used with socialist feminism and critical theory epistemologies and a qualitative constructionist grounded theory methodology. Interviews were conducted with 46 <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> working at five five-star hotels. This research contributes to hospitality literature by focusing on the influence of broader socio-economic hierarchies functioning within hotels, an arena not usually encompassed within hospitality studies. We argue that 'distinction work' involves a process wherein the causal aspects of demonstration of deference to guests during interactions, and the conditional aspects of the lower social standing of <b>room</b> <b>attendants</b> within the broader socio-economic arena, result in embedded ostracism. This article presents a new perspective on the low social value currently placed on <b>room</b> <b>attendant</b> employment.

We are developing a multi-modal <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> data analyzing system for studying <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> interaction dynamics, in which head pose estimation {{is one of the}} key components.

The 3 D head pose is estimated in one of the camera coordinate system, we develop a procedure to accurately convert the estimated 3 D pose in the camera coordinate system to that in the world coordinate system. In the experiment, visualization of the estimated head pose and location in world coordinate system verifies the soundness of our design.
