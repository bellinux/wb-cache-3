Assim, na Parte I faremos uma análise do poema emersoniano em que exporemos suas Principais Idéias, aquelas presentes em seus próprios livros, ensaios e poemas - antes e depois da feitura do poema (1841) -, para que possamos conhecer seu desenvolvimento intelectual, no rico diálogo com as tradições filosóficas Ocidental. Médio-Oriental e Oriental (que muito o influenciaram) -, uma vez que a idéia-chave por detrás desta Dissertação está fundada no outro comentário de Peirce ao enigma d A Esfinge - os símbolos crescem no ensaio What Is A Sign? (1894; O Que É Um Signo?) até chegar à sua Epistemologia de Estados de Espírito, sua Ética Existencial de Auto- Melhoramento e sua Metafísica do Processo, de acordo com Stanley Cavell, que é responsável pelo renascimento dos estudos filosóficos emersonianos nos EUA nas últimas três décadas. Na Parte II faremos uma análise estrutural (Martial Guéroult) da resposta que Peirce forneceu ao enigma emersoniano com seu ensaio, Uma Conjectura ao Enigma (1887 - 88) The {{main objective}} of this <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>Dissertation</b> is to know in an unprecedented work {{to what extent the}} mystic of Nature, orador, poet, essayist and Transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 82) may have influenced Pragmaticist and Semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 - 1914) through his poem, The Sphynx (1841; translated for the first time into Portuguese in Annex 1), which stimulated the latter to offer an answer to the Emersonian enigma in the essay, A Guess at the Riddle (1887 - 88; translated for the first time into Portuguese in Annex 2), something that, later, according to Nathan Houser & Christian Kloesel, led to the construction of his admirable Architectonic (The Essential Peirce - Volume 1, 245), about which Peirce himself wrote: this book, if ever written, as it soon will be if I am in a situation to do it, {{will be one of the}} births of time (Ibid, ibidem). Therefore, in Part I we will analyze Emerson s poem and will highlight his Main Ideas, those present in his own books, essays and poems - before and after the making of the poem (1841) -, so we can know his intellectual development, in his rich dialog with the Western, Middle-Eastern and Eastern philosophies (that influenced him tremendously) -, once the key-idea behind this <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>Dissertation</b> is grounded on Peirce s other comment on The Sphynx - symbols grow in the essay What Is A Sign? (1894) until we get to Emerson s Epistemology of Moods, his Existential Ethics of Sel-Improvement and his Metaphysics of Process, according to Stanley Cavell, who is responsible for the renaissance of Emerson s philosophical studies in the US in the last three decades. In Part II we will make a structural analysis (Martial Guéroult) of the answer Peirce gave to the Emersonian enigma in his essay, A Guess at the Riddle (1887 - 88...|$|R

Mediante pesquisa documental e bibliográfica, desenvolvida com base numa abordagem historiográfica decorrente das contribuições advindas da história {{cultural}} e por meio da análise da configuração textual, elaborou-se esta dissertação de mestrado que teve como corpus documental o manual Pedagogia: teoria e prática. Esse manual de ensino foi escrito por Antônio d Ávila e publicado em 1954 pela Companhia Editora Nacional, sua análise permitiu conhecer e compreender os saberes e práticas divulgados pelos professores na formação de novos quadros do magistério e compreender a concepção de Pedagogia nele presente e expressa por Antônio dþÁvila. Esse educador foi professor de várias disciplinas, inclusive de Pedagogia; autor de manuais de ensino; livros de leitura; tradutor; crítico pedagógico; escritor de colunas para jornais e revistas; conferencista; e membro de várias entidades profissionais e culturais. Os resultados da pesquisa permitem constatar que no manual analisado, encontra-se uma síntese dos saberes e práticas considerados essenciais para a formação do professor, especialmente o primário e julgados como necessários ao exercício eficiente e eficaz do magistério. Esses saberes e práticas derivam, predominantemente, do ideário escolanovista e encontram-se estreitamente relacionados com uma concepção católica no que diz respeito aos saberes e com relação à concepção de Pedagogia apresentada no manual estudado.

Through documental and bibliographic research, developed and based on a historiography approach as a consequence of contributions coming from cultural history and by means of analysis of textual configuration was elaborated this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>dissertation</b> which had as documental corpus the manual Pedagogy: theory and practice. This teaching manual was written by Antônio d Ávila and published in 1954 by Companhia Editora Nacional. Its analysis allowed us to know and understand the knowledges and practices, published by teachers in the forming of new tables in professorship and understanding the conception of Pedagogy presented on it and expressed by Antônio d Ávila. This educator was a professor in several subjects, including Pedagogy; author of teaching manuals; reading books; translator; Pedagogy critic; writer of newspaper and magazine columns; lecturer; and member of several cultural and professional entities. The results of this research allow us to acknowledge that in the analyzed manual there is a synthesis of the knowledges and practices considered essential to the forming of teachers, especially primary school ones, considered necessary to the effective and efficient teaching practice. These practices and knowledges derive, predominantly, from the idealist of the New School and are found narrowly related to a catholic conception concerning the knowledges and in relation to the conception of Pedagogy presented in the studied manual...|$|R

40|$|No Brasil, o Poder Legislativo sempre se fez presente no processo de celebração e conclusão de Tratados Internacionais. No Período Imperial, embora a Carta Política de 1824 não contemplasse, formalmente, a participação da Assembleia Geral, pode-se dizer que, na prática, a condução das relações exteriores era realizada por um conjunto de quatro órgãos do Estado: o Imperador, o Gabinete de Ministros, o Conselho de Estado e o Parlamento. Com a Proclamação da República, todos os textos constitucionais subsequentes passaram a assegurar, de forma expressa, a participação do Congresso Nacional no processo de produção de Textos Convencionais. Contudo, nenhuma de nossas Constituições, {{inclusive}} a atual, regulou a participação do Poder Legislativo nos casos de extinção de textos convencionais, razão por que o poder de denunciar tratados sempre foi exercido, de forma exclusiva, pelo Poder Executivo (mesmo nos casos em que a ratificação do instrumento internacional tenha dependido de aprovação do Congresso Nacional). Essa questão, muito debatida no campo doutrinário, chegou ao Supremo Tribunal Federal em 16 de junho de 1997, através da Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade (ADI) 1625, por meio da qual se pleiteava a declaração de inconstitucionalidade do Decreto nº 2. 100 de 20 de dezembro de 1996, que tornou pública a denúncia da Convenção n° 158 da Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), por ofensa ao disposto no art. 49, I da Constituição Federal. No bojo do julgamento dessa demanda, ajuizada pela Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura (CONTAG) e pela Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), três dos quatro ministros, que já proferiram seus votos, reconheceram a necessidade de prévia autorização do Congresso Nacional para o Poder Executivo efetivar a denúncia de Textos Convencionais. Persistindo esse entendimento no C. Supremo Tribunal Federal, haverá uma mudança de paradigma importante no campo do Direito dos Tratados, tema fundamental na área do direito internacional. A presente dissertação de mestrado tem por escopo fomentar, no meio acadêmico, discussões acerca da necessidade (ou não) da participação do Parlamento brasileiro nos casos de denúncia de Tratados, Convenções e Atos InternacionaisIn Brazil, the Legislative branch {{has always}} been present {{in the process of}} establishment and conclusion of International Treaties. In the Imperial Period, even though the 1824 Charter Policy did not formally provide for the General Assembly participation, it could conceivably be said that the conduct of the foreign affairs was carried out in practice by four State agencies: the Emperor, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Council of State and the Parliament. From the Proclamation of the Republic, all the constitutional texts provided expressly for the participation of the National Congress in the process of production of Treaty Texts. However none of our Constitutions &# 8210; including the current one &# 8210; has handled the participation of the Legislative branch in cases of termination of treaty texts and thus the power to cease the treat {{has always been}} exclusively held by the Executive branch (even in those cases where the ratification of the international instrument depended on the National Congress approval). This much discussed issue in the doctrine field has been brought to the Supreme Federal Court on June 16 th, 1997 by the means of the Direct Unconstitutionality Action (ADI) 1625 that pleaded the declaration of unconstitutionality of Decree 2, 100 of December 20 th, 1996 which made public the cease of the Convention 158 of the International Organization of Labor (OIT) for offence to the provisions of art. 49, I of the Constitution. Within the scope of the judgment of this process filed by the National Confederation of the Workers in Agriculture (CONTAG) and the Central Workers Union Confederation (CUT), three out the four Ministers who have already voted have acknowledged the need of prior consent from the National Congress to the Executive branch to proceed to the termination of Treaty Texts. If this understanding persists in the C. Supreme Federal Court there will be an important change of model in the field of the Law of Treaties, which is a basic issue under the international law. This <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>dissertation</b> aims to foster discussions within the academic community concerning the need (or not) for the Brazilian Parliament participation in Treaties, Conventions and International Acts termination proces...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of innovative entrepreneurship for {{sustained economic growth}} is increasing (IMF, 2017). This is the fundamental motivation for this thesis, in which a study on team maturity, innovation capability, and firm performance in Norwegian entrepreneurships has been performed. The study has contributed with new insight in this area, as well as identifying several interesting elements for further research. Two research questions have guided the study: RQ 1 : Is there an effect on firm performance from team maturity and innovation capability in entrepreneurships? And RQ 2 : Is there an effect from University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> programs in entrepreneurship on team maturity, innovation capability and/or firm performance in entrepreneurships? In sum, {{it was found that}} high team maturity in entrepreneurial teams leads to high innovation capability for the entrepreneurship. There was found a more varied degree of support for that high innovation capability leads to high firm performance in entrepreneurships, and that high team maturity leads to high firm performance moderated by innovation capability in entrepreneurships. A positive relationship was found via some methods, however the findings were not consistent across other methods. Further investigation of these relationships in other studies is therefore recommended before any final conclusions can be drawn. Especially, the understanding of firm performance in entrepreneurships should be studied further. As for RQ 2, this study has consistently not found any positive effect on team maturity, innovation capability, or firm performance from the affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship. It was also found that the entrepreneurships with an affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship were less inclined to use the team as an arena for innovation than the entrepreneurships without such an affiliation. It is recommended that further research look into these relationships to strengthen the understanding of the causes for these findings...|$|R
