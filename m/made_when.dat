5|$|A {{reference}} to The Simpsons appearance in The Tracey Ullman Show is <b>made</b> <b>when</b> the Griffins are shown as {{characters in the}} show. Family Guy producer David A. Goodman comments that, contrary to what some think, the show {{was not trying to}} criticize The Simpsons, but rather trying to show the differences in voices and character appearance.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were <b>made</b> <b>when</b> a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|An {{indirect}} {{reference to}} this storyline is <b>made</b> <b>when</b> Matt Murdock looks for possible solutions to restore his secret identity; while talking with Daimon Hellstrom, Hellstrom mentions that Mephisto {{has done something}} similar to what Matt is looking for, but Matt rejects this as an option.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} work {{depicting}} Elgar is Ken Russell's 1962 BBC television film Elgar, <b>made</b> <b>when</b> the composer was still largely out of fashion. This hour-long film contradicted {{the view of}} Elgar as a jingoistic and bombastic composer, and evoked the more pastoral and melancholy side of his character and music.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of all of}} these hallmarks is not needed for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered <b>made</b> <b>when,</b> with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} {{a variety of}} calls; the two most common being the alarm call, <b>made</b> <b>when</b> {{possible}} predators (such as humans or other mammals) enter the colonies, and the advertising call. The advertising call is social in nature, <b>made</b> <b>when</b> returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the bird song of passerines, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from begging calls made by females during mating to attack calls made while swooping at intruders.|$|E
5|$|Tuition {{fees are}} {{currently}} capped at £3,805 in Northern Ireland, with loans {{of the same}} size available from Student Finance NI. Loan repayments are <b>made</b> <b>when</b> income rises above £17,335 a year, with graduates paying back a percentage of their earnings above this threshold.|$|E
5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously <b>made</b> <b>when</b> in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E

5|$|Around 1959, M-43 was {{shifted to}} bypass Grand Ledge. The former route through town was {{retained}} {{as a state}} highway, designated Bus. M-43. M-43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section of highway that was formerly part of US16 on Grand River Avenue; the extension to Webberville was <b>made</b> <b>when</b> the I-96 freeway opened that year. Through the Lansing area, M-43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown. This former routing was renumbered M-143.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been <b>made.</b> <b>When</b> chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be <b>made</b> <b>when</b> fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E

5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is <b>made</b> <b>when</b> an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Gigli (as {{the agent}} of Wolsey and Henry VIII) {{arranged}} for another cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (future Pope Clement VII) to be cardinal protector of England. Medici's letter of appointment makes no reference to Sisto della Rovere. A 8 February 1514 letter from Pope Leo X to Henry VIII of England flatters the king for having elevated the pope's cardinal-nephew and cousin as protector. The pope's brother Giuliano de' Medici was also made a Knight of the Garter (just as Guidobaldo II della Rovere had been <b>made</b> <b>when</b> della Rovere had been made protector).|$|E

5|$|In 1905, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Wilfrid Laurier, the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. This change was <b>made</b> <b>when</b> Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan were sectioned off from the territory on September 1, 1905. After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions, there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure. The non-Inuit population was estimated to total around 1,000. Inuit were not counted at the time because they had no status under Canadian law, and were not yet settled in towns or villages.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely <b>made</b> <b>when</b> only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Raiders of the Lost Ark {{opened at}} #14 and grossed $1,673,731 from 267 theaters ($6,269 theater average) during its opening weekend. In total, the IMAX release grossed $3,125,613 domestically. The film, made on an $18 million budget, grossed $384 million {{worldwide}} throughout its theatrical releases. In North America, {{it was by}} some distance the highest-grossing film of 1981, and {{remains one of the}} top twenty-five highest-grossing films ever <b>made</b> <b>when</b> adjusted for inflation. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 70 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.|$|E
