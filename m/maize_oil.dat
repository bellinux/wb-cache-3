50|$|Corn oil (<b>maize</b> <b>oil)</b> is oil {{extracted}} from the germ of corn (maize). Its main use is in cooking, where its high smoke point makes refined corn oil a valuable frying oil. It is also a key ingredient in some margarines. Corn oil is generally less expensive than most other types of vegetable oils. One bushel of corn contains 1.55 pounds of corn oil (2.8% by weight). Corn agronomists have developed high-oil varieties; however, these varieties tend to show lower field yields, so they are not universally accepted by growers.|$|E

40|$|Crude oils {{extracted}} from three vegetable seeds namely: soya beans (Glycine max), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and maize (Zea mays) purchased {{from a local}} market in Sagamu Ilisan, Ogun State were investigated. Extraction of the oils from the seeds {{was carried out by}} soxhlet method using petroleum ether as the extractant. The physio-chemical properties of the oils were determined using Gas Chromatography (GC) and other standard methods. The results of physical analysis showed that soy bean oil had the highest percentage of oil yield (14. 51 %), followed by groundnut oil (10. 54 %) and lastly maize (6. 63 %). The refractive indexes of the oils are as follows: Soya bean oil (1. 4662), groundnut (1. 4622) and maize (1. 4632). The chemical analysis showed that the saponification values were 228. 19, 227. 49 and 211. 37 mg KOH/g and free fatty acid values were 6. 85, 1. 65 and 23. 35 mgNaOH/g for soybean, groundnut and <b>maize</b> <b>oils</b> respectively. The acid values were 19. 21, 4. 63 and 65. 50 mg KOH/g and iodine values were 73. 02, 38. 65 and 47. 25 for soybean, groundnut and <b>maize</b> <b>oils</b> respectively. Gas Chromatography analysis gave the following fatty acid profiles: oleic (26. 2 %), linoleic (5. 5 %), stearic (4. 8 %), myristic (1. 5 %) and lauric (1. 25 %) for groundnut oil; oleic (26. 2 %), linoleic (8. 5 %), stearic (5. 6 %) for soybean oil while corn oil contained stearic (3. 8 %) and oleic (4. 6 %). The study revealed that the three vegetable seeds are good sources of edible oils. Soya bean oil is considered to be the most suitable for food formulation as well as drying oil in pharmaceutical, paints, soap and perfume industries because of its higher level of unsaturation in the fatty acid contents...|$|R

The rats were fed by <b>maize</b> <b>oil</b> and peanut oil for 10 percent (w/w) of the diet and after three months and achieving to the maturation stage with macroscopic observations, the examination of blood hormones, tissue sections of testicles, and weight and volume measurement of the testis in each group were carried out. Results: Our data {{of the present study}} showed that there was a significant decrease in the amount of testosterone and FSH in the treatment groups compared to the control group (P< 0. 001) while this difference about LH and volume of the testis was P< 0. 001 for <b>maize</b> <b>oil</b> and P< 0. 05 for peanut oil.

Fatty acids, triacylglycerols, tocopherols, chlorophylls, beta-carotene, squalene, phenolic compounds and CIE L*a*b* coordinates were assayed. Strong chemical variability depending on the oilseed variety was observed.

DPPH radical scavenging activity expressed in TEAC ranged between 0. 45 and 2. 30 mmol/l in peanut and <b>maize</b> <b>oils,</b> respectively.

40|$|Consumption of {{different}} types of oil may have different effects on cardiovascular risk. The exact role of <b>maize</b> <b>oil,</b> cod liver oil, soya oil and extra virgin olive oil on endothelial function, oxidative stress and inflammation is unknown. We evaluated the effect of acute consumption of these types of oil on endothelial function, oxidative stress and inflammation in healthy adults. Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomised to receive an oral amount of each type of oil or water. Endothelial function was evaluated by gauge-strain plethysmography at baseline and 1, 2 and 3 h after consumption. Oxidative stress status was determined by total lipid peroxides (PEROX), while inflammatory process was estimated by measuring the soluble form of vascular adhesion molecule 1. Serum levels of the two previous markers were measured at baseline and 3 h after oil consumption. Reactive hyperaemia (RH) was significantly decreased after <b>maize</b> <b>oil</b> consumption compared with controls (P < 0. 05). However, the consumption of cod liver oil and soya oil induced a significant improvement of RH after 1 h, compared with controls (P < 0. 05). There was no significant effect of any type of oil consumption on endothelium-independent dilatation, total lipid PEROX and vascular adhesion molecule 1 serum levels. Consumption of <b>maize</b> <b>oil</b> leads to impaired endothelial function, while soya oil and cod liver oil slightly improve endothelial function. However, all types of oils did not affect inflammatory process and systemic oxidative stress, suggesting that their effect on endothelial function may not be mediated by free radicals bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} investigate the influence of different oils in the diets of laying quail on their egg quality characteristics. One hundred and twenty 7 -wk old Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were allocated to four groups with three replicates containing 10 quail each (30 quail per each treatment group). They were fed for 13 weeks (including one week of adaptation period) on diets containing 3 % oil from different sources, viz. either sunflower (T 1), linseed (T 2), maize (T 3), or fish oil (T 4). Inclusion the diet of laying quail with fish oil (T 4) and <b>maize</b> <b>oil</b> (T 2) resulted in significant increase with respect to egg weight, yolk weight, albumen weight, yolk diameter, yolk height, albumen diameter, albumen height, shell thickness and Haugh unit during all periods of experiment and in total means of these parameters.

Cholesterol content (48. 33 mg/ 100 g) was not affected by diet. The fatty acid profile was affected by the different diets: the intramuscular fat from lambs on Diet 3 was more saturated (43. 88 %) and with less essential fatty acids (ω- 3 : 0. 92 % and ω- 6 : 10. 15 %) than the fat of the other two diets (Diet 1 : respectively, 42. 98 %, 1. 28 % and 10. 50 %; Diet 2 : respectively 43. 20 %, 1. 20 % and 10. 67 %). M. longissimus lumborum had a dietetically better acid profile than the semitendinosus muscle.

A comparison between tissues highlighted a similar composition between the subcutaneous and intermuscular fats of the proximal pelvic limb that were different (P≤ 0. 01) from the subcutaneous fat of the loin. Despite these small differences, the quality of the meat and of the fat of these lambs was dietetically good.

A F 2 population derived from CE 03005 × B 73 was used to analysis the genetic effects influencing kernel oil content and to map kernel oil content QTL. Ears from three generations were harvested and the individual kernel oil content of each generation was measured with nuclear magnetic resonance. Genetic analysis showed that the average oil content of white kernels {{was significantly higher than}} that of yellow kernels. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses were compared using composite interval mapping. A QTL (oilc 6 -m 1 ）associated with high kernel oil content was detected in the three generations at bin 6. 01 of chromosome 6 near the phenotypic marker SC (seed color). The mapping results were congruent with the genetic analysis. The results explained the reason why the oil content of the white colored kernels was higher than that of the yellow ones because the oil content QTL linked tightly with the seed color gene in chromosome 6 in the mutant. The way of QTL mapping was credible. Molecular and phenotypic markers identified could be used for breeding purpose and would lend convenience in cloning QTL.
