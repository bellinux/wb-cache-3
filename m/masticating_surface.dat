40|$|ABSTRACT: Morphological and morphometric {{data of the}} buccal cavity, {{pharyngeal}} {{bone and}} dentition of two species of Hypophthalmicthys (i. e. H. molitrix and H. nobilis) were collected. The structure of the bucccopharyngeal cavity (BC) of Hypophthalmicthys spp. follows a typical pattern of teleost fish. BC in bighead carp is comparatively bigger than that of silver carp measuring 29. 01 % and 28. 12 % of standard body length. Mouth gape measures 21. 7 % of head length in bighead carp and 31. 06 % of head length in silver carp. In both the species ventral surface of the lateral projection of pharyngeal bone bears pits and openings however, their position differs. This can be a high weight taxonomic character for {{the identification of the}} two species. Both species exhibit small teeth bearing area with Dl/Pl ratio < 0. 5. Pharyngeal bone bears a single row of teeth (0, 4 - 4, 0) with their <b>masticating</b> <b>surface</b> steeply inclined towards dorso-mesially.

40|$|The {{comparative}} morphology of the foregut during {{development from}} embryonic larva to adult in Cherax quadricarinatus was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. Major ontogenetic changes {{occurred in the}} gastric mill dentition in terms of denticle shape, appearance of vertical ridges in the lateral teeth, roughness of <b>masticating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> degree of scierotization and proportional sizes of the median tooth components. Natural food types appropriate for the various life history stages during artificial rearing of C. quadricarinatus may be inferred from the morphology of the gastric mill dentition of those stages. Cardiopylorie valves and the gland filter appeared prior to development of functional gastric mill teeth. Compared with the foregut of adult astacid crayfish, that of adult C. quadricarinatus shows differences in the ventral cardiopyloric valve, pyloric funnel and lateral valves...|$|R
