40|$|We {{develop an}} {{interactive}} simulation model that links ecological and economic systems, {{and explore the}} dynamics of harvest patterns as they simultaneously affect natural and human capital. Our models represent both single and multiple systems. The level of natural capital is influenced by interactions of (1) natural capital growth and (non-human influenced) depletion, (2) ecological fluctuations, (3) harvest rules, and (4) biological transfers from one ecological system to another. We focus first on isolated systems {{in which there are}} no biological transfers between units and humans rely for subsistence on the resource; thus both the economic and ecological portions of the system are relatively independent of other systems. In this case, the maximum sustainable harvest rate depends on the local carrying capacity, the stock growth rate, and fluctuations in such ecological variables as rainfall and temperature, which are ‘extrinsic ’ to the stock–human harvest, but nonetheless affect stock levels. Next, we address spatially complex situations in which biological resources move from one spatial unit to others. In these models, the greater the potential <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> across ecosystems, the more any particular human sub-system can increase its harvesting rate without danger of its own collapse — although at a cost to neighboring subsystems. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The cross-correlations between price {{fluctuations}} of 201 frequently traded {{stocks in the}} National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this paper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996 - 2006, which coincides with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization. The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, C, of NSE {{is found to be}} similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) : the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack of distinct sector identity in the market, with the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed markets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to the same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that emerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the link between}} social media {{and its effect on}} stock exchanges and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks.</b> The study uses Twitter as its primary social media platform and focuses on its effect on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The study examines various forms of social media and micro-blogging sites in its attempt to provide a thorough understanding of the role of social media within the market. In line with its exploration of social media, the study analyses User-Generated Content, Sentiment Analysis and the impact of Word-of-Mouth. A brief explanation of Algorithmic Trading, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and the Adaptive Market Hypothesis is also provided. The information used to show the relationship between Twitter and the JSE was extracted using a quantitative survey answered by registered traders on the JSE. The survey aimed to ascertain the level of information pertaining to stock movement posted to the platform by these traders, and how these traders used that same information to make trading decisions. The results of the study show that Twitter and other micro-blogging sites have a level of determination in stock exchanges. This study shows that traders make some use of online information to inform their trading decisions on the Stock Market. The validity of this online information {{stems from the fact that}} traders place trust in other people and other users’ experience, as proven by Word of Mouth. The findings of this study were contrary to the researchers’ expectation that Twitter was widely used as an informant for trade decisions. What is deduced from the available findings is that while Twitter and other social media platforms do to some extent provide information for traders on the JSE in making trade decisions, it is not a wide-spread basis for movement of shares.

40|$|Acute hepatopancreatic {{necrosis}} disease (AHPND), formerly called early mortality syndrome (EMS), {{was first}} reported in 2010 among penaeid shrimps cultivated in the Mekong Delta Region of Viet Nam albeit without any laboratory confirmation. The disease subsequently spread {{to a wide}} range of shrimp production areas in the same region (Soc Trang: 1, 719 ha; Bac Lieu: 346 ha; and Ca Mau: 3, 493 ha), so that the Government of Viet Nam requested for technical assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 2011. In 2012, FAO supported Viet Nam through the project TCP/VIE/ 3304 Emergency assistance to control the spread of an unknown disease affecting shrimps in Viet Nam, under which the Department of Animal Health of Viet Nam (DAH) collaborated with the University of Arizona and FAO experts to carry out indepth studies to identify the etiologic agent of the disease. As a result, unique isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was identified as the causative agent of AHPND in 2013. Viet Nam has been vigilant and transparent with regard to aquatic animal diseases through official notifications to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA). AHPND outbreaks have no clear temporal pattern with black tiger (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg (P. vannamei) shrimps showing similar incidence risk. The disease occurs at any stage of shrimp cultivation, i. e. on average about 35 days after stocking. To date, unwarranted outbreaks of AHPND in major shrimp-producing provinces in Viet Nam have been apparently regulated. Aside from AHPND, white spot disease (WSD) has also been a persistent problem responsible for serious economic losses in many shrimp-producing areas in Viet Nam. To prevent and control the further spread of infectious diseases of shrimps including AHPND and WSD, multiple control measures have been implemented including guidance of farmers to improve production conditions, facilities and biosecurity application, active surveillance of shrimp production areas for early warning, screening of broodstock and postlarvae for any OIE listed diseases, regulation on <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> and collaboration with regional and international organizations in carrying out in-depth epidemiological studies that will be needed in the formulation of pragmatic and holistic disease interventions...|$|E

40|$|This chapter uses monthly U. K. {{stock market}} data sorted into a {{two-dimensional}} set of portfolios {{to establish the}} year-on-year migration dynamics of stock movements between portfolios. The system of (monthly re-balanced) portfolios comprises six dividend yield strata (including a separate zero-dividend category) {{each of which is}} further subdivided into market capitalisation quintiles. Monthly re-balancing ensures that portfolios are constantly populated by stocks having similar dividend yield and size characteristics; the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> year-on-year, between portfolios provides information about the relationship linking returns behaviour to yield. Simply stated, the analysis of migration patterns provides additional insights into the phenomenon of the much-quoted ‘U-shaped’ characteristic which purports to relate risk-adjusted returns to dividend yield; it does so by drawing attention to the similarities between high-yielding and zero-dividend stocks, a linkage which is de-emphasised when these are conventionally viewed as being at opposite ends of a yield spectrum. This leads to the notion of ‘adjacency’, and implies a circular, rather than linear, relationship between returns and yield; a notion supported by the relatively high levels of direct migration between these two (high- and zero-yielding) groups; and by the observation, both in this chapter and in the supporting literature, that smaller firms with high average returns are concentrated in the two groups. The analysis here of direct migration also takes account of stocks distinguished by year-on-year expansion versus year-on-year contraction; it emerges as being both robust to, and consistent with this separation. A plausible explanation for such direct migration would be one associated with ‘distress’, whereby declining price levels among such stocks tends to inflate the yield metric (implying migration toward the ‘high dividend’ stratum) as firms struggle to maintain dividend levels; ultimately, firms fall directly, upon virtually inevitable dividend cessation, into the zero-dividend category. A similar analysis applies when growing firms commence paying dividends for the first time. Finally, the analysis examines the dynamics of the process in terms of a long-run equilibrium and a speed of adjustment, treating the transition matrix as a Markov process; it finds plausible values for these parameters {{in the context of the}} UK stock marke...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{accurately}} {{predict the}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices is always of both academic importance and practical value. So far, {{a lot of}} research has been reported to help understand the behavior <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices. However, some of the existing theories tend to render us the belief that the time series <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices are unpredictable on a long-term timescale. The question arises whether the long-term predictability exists in stock price dynamics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we analyze the price reversals in the US stock market and the Chinese stock market {{on the basis of a}} renormalization method. The price reversals are divided into two types: retracements (the downward trends after upward trends) and rebounds (the upward trends after downward trends), of which the intensities are described by dimensionless quantities, R(t) and R(b), respectively. We reveal that for both mature and emerging markets, the distribution of either retracements R(t) or rebounds R(b) shows two characteristic values, 0. 335 and 0. 665, both of which are robust over the long term. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The methodology presented here provides a way to quantify the stock price reversals. Our findings strongly support the existence of the long-term predictability in stock price dynamics, and may offer a hint on how to predict the long-term <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess the pricing <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> that are traded on both a US stock {{exchange}} and a non-US stock exchange to determine whether interaction exists between the two exchanges. Design/methodology/approach – This article identifies extreme price <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> (winners and losers) in the non-US stock exchanges that also trade as American depository receipts (ADRs) in the US market, and measure the US market response. Also identifies extreme price <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> (winners and losers) in the US stock exchanges that also trade in the non-US markets, and measure the non-US market response. Findings – Finds a significant reversal of winners and losers in the US market, which suggests that the US market attempts to correct the pricing in non-US markets. Also finds that extreme ADR price movements in the US markets are followed by corrections in the non-US market. Research limitations/implications – Market participants appear to monitor unusual stock price movements that just occurred in other markets, and correct for unusual price movements that cannot be rationalized. Such activity in global markets expedites the process by which price discrepancies are corrected. The evidence also suggests that the cost of equity in one market can be influenced by the actions of investors in another market.
