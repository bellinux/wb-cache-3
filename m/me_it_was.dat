5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
25|$|Smiles, {{tears and}} {{laughter}} followed. Appreciation showed on over 300 faces. An officer told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first time}} anyone had met their train and that North Platte had helped the boys keep up their spirits.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Watching {{you do this}} is of {{real use}} to <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not only your skill and dexterity that fascinates <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> your cheery {{confidence}} in yourself, your inexplicable hopefulness, that does me good." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{you wish}} to criticize my work, tell me you can predict and explain legal and related {{behavior}} better than I can. Tell me my work is not as testable as something else, tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not as general as something else, tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> less elegant than something else, tell <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> has already <b>been</b> published, or just tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wrong. Tell <b>me</b> something relevant to what I am trying to accomplish — something scientific." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. You sold a Cabinet {{secret for}} money! You began {{your life with}} fraud! You built up your career on dishonour! Oh, tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not true! Lie to me! Lie to <b>me!</b> Tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not true! ...|$|R
25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since I have always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for me to move on.|$|E
25|$|While {{a student}} in college he wrote his first {{collection}} of poems entitled The Brunette Told <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a collection of romantic verses that made several startling references to a woman's body, sending shock waves throughout the conservative society in Damascus. To make it more acceptable, Qabbani showed it to Munir al-Ajlani, the minister of education {{who was also a}} friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the preface for Nizar's first book.|$|E
25|$|On the 1stofMay {{the city}} of New York has the {{appearance}} of sending off a population flying from the plague, or of a town which had surrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods and chattels. Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, wagons, and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, and draymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from east to west, from north to south, on this day. Every one I spoke to on the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, but all assured <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house. More than one of my New York friends have built or bought houses solely to avoid this annual inconvenience.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only tell <b>me,</b> Helena, what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Tell <b>me</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> At least tell me, Helena; tell <b>me</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Oh, {{but this}} is dreadful!' ...|$|R

25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly {{then he would have}} cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’.|$|E
500|$|Alf {{tended to}} speak in a very poncey plum-in-the-mouth way. It was all [...] "Oh hello Rodney and how are you?". To <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all {{complete}} bollocks.|$|E
5000|$|And {{concerning}} the matter about which you commanded <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well.|$|R

500|$|Jackie Joseph later {{recalled}} [...] "at first they told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a detective movie; then, while I was flying back , I think they wrote {{a whole new}} movie, more in the horror genre. I think over a weekend they rewrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "set in Queens and Greenwich Village, another New York {{neighborhood}} book, {{very much}} {{about the life of}} the city... writing about Greenwich Village in 1958 was really a jump for <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> as much of an imaginative leap as any of the more fantastical things I've done. But really exciting, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Aurelio De Laurentiis, club {{president}} of Napoli, dedicated the cup win to the then unidentified fan {{who had been}} shot before the match and operated on. On the pre-match violence, Demetrio Albertini, vice {{president of}} the Italian Football Federation, said, [...] "It certainly wasn't a great scene, what we displayed today alongside football, for a football lover like <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an ugly display." ...|$|E

500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because he told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Elliott said, [...] "I really do think this is my best album. I was in a really great space with this album. I wasn't in a great space {{with some of the}} other albums I've done." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I played Lil' Kim the album the other day, and she told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> incredible and that there was not one song on it that she didn't like." ...|$|E

500|$|But my friend, {{as you may}} easily imagine, is Nicolo who by-the-by, is my Italian master, and we {{are already}} very philosophical. I am his [...] "Padrone" [...] and his [...] "amico", and the Lord knows what besides. It is about two hours since, that, after informing me he was most desirous to follow him (that is me) over the world, he {{concluded}} by telling <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> proper for us not only to live, but [...] "morire insieme" [...] The latter I hope to avoid– {{as much of the}} former as he pleases.|$|E
500|$|Jerry's parents, Helen (Liz Sheridan) and Morty Seinfeld, {{are staying}} at Jerry's {{apartment}} in New York City, making themselves at home. He bursts in, wearing baseball clothes, carrying a bat and glove, and proudly tells them that during his softball game, [...] "I made an incredible {{play in the}} field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be {{in the championship game}} Wednesday because of <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> the single greatest moment in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Michels {{stated that}} the victory was proof that Ajax could match teams in Europe: [...] "The Liverpool game was for me an {{important}} moment to be acknowledged and recognised internationally. Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. We drew that game 2–2 and never really had problems. For <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the proof that we were at the international level." ...|$|E
