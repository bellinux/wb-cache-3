5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas. These <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> {{transition}} in the religion in Aksum when Frumentius was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving weight to the writings of Rufinus. The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.|$|E
5|$|Beonna was {{the first}} of the East Anglian kings whose coinage named both the ruler and his title. His coins are larger than the earlier sceattas, but are small when {{compared}} with the pennies produced in Anglo-Saxon England several decades later. As a whole, they provide an important dateable runic corpus and <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> distinctive East Anglian preference for runic lettering. Beonna had three moneyers whose names are known: Werferth, Efe and Wilred. The coins struck by Werferth are considered to be the earliest. His coins and those struck under the authority of Eadberht of Northumbria both contained 70% silver and were similar in type and detail, which suggests the possibility of producing a chronology for Beonna's coins, using the established sequence for the Northumbrian coins of Eadberht. However, as Eadberht's reign began in 738, several years before Beonna became king in East Anglia, the coins cannot be related to each other closely enough to construct a reliable chronology.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E

5|$|During Jænberht's term of office, {{a dispute}} arose between the see of Canterbury and Offa which led in 787 to the {{creation}} of the rival Archdiocese of Lichfield under Hygberht. Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control. There were several reasons for the conflict between Jænberht and Offa. Jænberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and Jænberht refused to crown Offa's son Ecgfrith. Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury. Matthew Paris, writing in the thirteenth century, stated that Jænberht conspired to admit Charlemagne to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> genuine tradition recorded at St Albans Abbey, where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of Jænberht's life where Paris had no other information. A rumour during Jænberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope Hadrian I; at least one modern historian, Simon Keynes, believes it possible Jænberht was behind the rumour. Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of Jænberht and the Kentish people.|$|E

25|$|In 1942 the LDF {{strength}} was 98,429. In 1943 this rose to 103,530. And in 1944 {{it was at}} 96,152. These strengths were regarded as being effective and <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> rise and fall as the European battle front approached or receded from Irish shores.|$|E
25|$|JE virus IgM {{antibodies}} {{are usually}} detectable 3 to 8 days after onset {{of illness and}} persist for 30 to 90 days, but longer persistence has been documented. Therefore, positive IgM antibodies occasionally <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> past infection or vaccination. Serum collected within 10 days of illness onset may not have detectable IgM, and the test should be repeated on a convalescent sample. For patients with JE virus IgM antibodies, confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing should be performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors {{and it was}} suggested that the {{expression of}} proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata. However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} issue confronting {{the criminal justice}} system is sentencing disparity. Sentencing disparity involves inequitable sanctions imposed on individuals who have committed similar offenses.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree that}} the Bhagavata Purana was a socially and sexually revolutionary text, states Coleman, rather it <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> conservative ideology where {{women in the}} form of Gopis amorously chase the divine Krishna who is represented as a man, the liberation of Gopis is actually fleeting despite their praise in the text as the most blessed of devotees for love. Many scholars, however, view the Bhagavata as a remarkably early literary work that questions and discusses social and gender norms in the 5th to 10th-century India.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of Raheny lies {{the remains of a}} large ancient ringfort (or rath) from which the area gets its name. The rath extends under the centre of the modern village, from beside the Santry River, {{including}} some marshy ground, to the Roman Catholic church, Windsor Motors, the Scout Den and the two St. Assam's Churches. Some excavations were carried out in the 1970s, giving an idea of its size (probably c. 110m across) and structure. The old church and graveyard complex behind the village plaza <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> remnant of the rath, as does some embankment behind the Scout Den.|$|E
25|$|While the {{recycled}} nutrients may support some phytoplankton growth, {{it ultimately}} feeds back to increased C. amurensis populations. The recent invasion success of Limnoithona tetraspina may {{be understood in}} terms of this phenomenon. It feeds on ciliates and microflagellates which are too small to be grazed by the clam, thereby avoiding competition. Additionally, L. tetraspina appears impervious to predation by the clam or (almost) anything else. The rise of the microbial food web and the invasion of L. tetraspina capitalize are the result of an untapped alternative path for energy flow in the food web, facilitated by C. amurensis. Subsequent patterns of invasion <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> similar pattern.|$|E
30|$|The initial failure {{triggered}} {{at approximately}} 220  m a.s.l., approximately 20  m below the ridge.

25|$|The biological/maturational account {{suggests}} that genetic fitness is improved by having many memories that {{fall within the}} reminiscence bump. Cognitive capacities are at their optimum from the ages of 10 to 30 and the reminiscence bump <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> peak in cognitive performance. This account is therefore sometimes called the cognitive abilities account. Researchers {{have suggested that the}} increase of cognitive ability in early adulthood may cause memories during this time period to be more adequately stored (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). The reminiscence bump is caused by age-related differences in encoding efficiency, which cause more memories to be stored in adolescence and early adulthood.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} Tajima et al. (2004), two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men {{have been found to}} belong to Haplogroup C-M217, which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the {{indigenous}} populations of Siberia and Mongolia. Hammer et al. (2006) have tested a sample of four Ainu men and have found that one of them belongs to haplogroup C-M217. Some researchers have speculated that this minority of Haplogroup C-M217 carriers among the Ainu <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> certain degree of unidirectional genetic influence from the Nivkhs, a traditionally nomadic people of northern Sakhalin and the adjacent mainland, with whom the Ainu have long-standing cultural interactions.|$|E
25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just {{did not think of}} splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
50|$|TubZ {{functions}} in segregating low copy-number plasmids during bacterial cell division. The protein forms a structure {{unusual for a}} tubulin homolog; two helical filaments wrap around one another. This <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> optimal structure for this role since the unrelated plasmid-partitioning protein ParM exhibits a similar structure.|$|R

25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by JE Pattison, who suggested that the Y-chromosome evidence could still {{support the idea of}} a small settlement of people without the apartheid-like structures. In addition, there is no reliable method for dating the influx of genetic material into Britain from the Continent; and the genetic similarities between people {{on either side of the}} North Sea <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> cumulative process of population movement, possibly beginning well before the historically attested formation of the Anglo-Saxons or the invasions of the Vikings. The 'apartheid theory' has received a considerable body of critical comment, especially the genetic studies from which it derives its rationale. Problems with the design of Weale's study and the level of historical naivete evidenced by some population genetics studies have been particularly highlighted.|$|E
25|$|The 1918 flu {{pandemic}} in humans {{was associated with}} H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. For instance, swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100million people were killed worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{identification}} of Hnæf and Finn being brothers-in-law makes the situation much clearer, it shifts the emphasis of explanation onto the reason behind the subsequent battle. The battle <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> reoccurrence of the tensions which Hildeburh's marriage {{may have been a}} diplomatic move to quell. If {{the identification}} between the characters holds, moreover, then the son of Hildeburh and nephew of Hnæf who dies in the battle is probably therefore the son of Finn; he may even have been heir to the Frisian kingdom. In this respect it is especially notable that Hildeburh's son is laid on Hnæf's pyre. Tolkien suggested that Hildeburh's son was raised by Hnæf, and was being brought back to Finn at his coming of age; even that Hildeburh's son was one of the party besieged with Hnæf inside the great hall. Such a theory would add an extra layer of complexity, of a feeling of possible responsibility for filicide, to the already complicated psychological motivations of Finn.|$|E
5000|$|Rumbolds Point (...) {{is a point}} which {{marks the}} east side of the {{entrance}} to Doubtful Bay at the southeast end of South Georgia. The name appears on a chart based upon surveys of this area in 1930 by DI personnel, but <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> earlier naming.|$|R
25|$|The hobby of {{collecting}} often goes hand-in-hand {{with an interest}} in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting postcards <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> interest in different places and cultures.

50|$|The {{intentional}} use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may {{be regarded}} as anachronistic.
