25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> {{running through}} much of Umicore's history is the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK), a company {{incorporated}} in 1906 to exploit the vast natural resources of the Congo Free State, later the Belgian Congo and now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Initially the UMHK concentrated on mining the state's extensive copper deposits, before diversifying into cobalt, tin, uranium (in which it at one point held a near-monopoly in global supply) and other precious metals. The company also constructed casting and smelting facilities, eventually growing {{to such an extent}} that it represented around half of all revenues taken in by the Congolese government. In early January 1967, the UMHK was nationalized by the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko, and over $800 million of the company's assets were seized by the state.|$|E

To Dame Lilias, Mother Clare's quiet cell at St. Katharine's was a blessed haven of rest, peace, and charity, such as was neither the guest-chamber nor the Prioress's parlour at St. Helen's, with all the distractions of the princesses' visitors and invitations, and with the Lady Joanna continually pulling against the authority that the Cardinal, her uncle, was exerting over his nieces.|$|E
6000|$|There was one <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> {{of painful}} {{experience}} in Nancy's married life, {{and on it}} hung certain deeply-felt scenes, which were the oftenest revived in retrospect. The short dialogue with Priscilla in the garden had determined the current of retrospect in that frequent direction this particular Sunday afternoon. The first wandering of her thought from the text, which she still attempted dutifully to follow with her eyes and silent lips, was into an imaginary enlargement of the defence she had set up for her husband against Priscilla's implied blame. The vindication of the loved object is the best balm affection can find for its wounds:--"A man must have so much on his mind," [...] is the belief by which a wife often supports a cheerful face under rough answers and unfeeling words. And Nancy's deepest wounds had all come from {{the perception that the}} absence of children from their hearth was dwelt on in her husband's mind as a privation to which he could not reconcile himself.|$|E

60|$|There was a Mrs Pods {{with three}} little girls, and a Mrs Tods with two little boys, whose first casual glance {{at each other}} was transmuted into a glare of undying and unreasoning hate. These ladies were {{exceptions}} {{to the rule of}} general urbanity before mentioned. Both had fiery faces, and each read the other through and through at a glance. There was a Miss Bluestocking who charmed some people, irritated others, frightened a few, and caused many to sneer. Her chief friend among the males was a young man named Mr Weakeyes, who had a small opinion of himself and a very receptive mind. Miss Troolove, among the ladies, was her chief friend. The strange misnomers which one meets with in society were also found in the little world in that steamer--that Royal Mail steamer we should say--for, while we turn aside for a brief period to condescend upon these particulars, we would not have the reader forget that they have an indirect bearing on the <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> of our tale.|$|E

So he wrote and wrote in feverish haste, {{drinking}} cup after cup of tea, and turning off page after page of foolscap, till long past midnight. The whole theory had come up so distinctly before his mind's eye, under the exceptional exaltation of first love, and the powerful stimulus of the day's excitement, that he wrote it off as though he had it by heart; omitting only the mathematical calculations, which he left blank, not because he had not got them clearly in his head, but because he would not stop his flying pen to copy them all out then and there at full length, for fear of losing the <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> of his argument. When he had finished, about forty sheets of foolscap lay huddled together on the table before him, written in a hasty hand, and scarcely legible; but they contained the first rough draft and central principle of that immortal work, the [...] "Transcendental Dynamics." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we started}} from Liverpool, in May, 1871, Ralph the Heir was {{running through the}} St. Paul's. This was the novel of which Charles Reade {{afterwards}} took the plot and made on it a play. I have always thought it {{to be one of}} the worst novels I have written, and almost to have justified that dictum that a novelist after fifty should not write love-stories. It was in part a political novel; and that part which appertains to politics, and which recounts the electioneering experiences of the candidates at Percycross, is well enough. Percycross and Beverley were, of course, one and the same place. Neefit, the breeches-maker, and his daughter, are also good in their way,--and Moggs, the daughter's lover, who was not only lover, but also one of the candidates at Percycross as well. But the <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> of the story,--that which tells of the doings of the young gentlemen and young ladies,--the heroes and the heroines,--is not good. Ralph the heir has not much life about him; while Ralph who is not the heir, but is intended to be the real hero, has none. The same may be said of the young ladies,--of whom one, she who was meant to be the chief, has passed utterly out of my mind, without leaving a trace of remembrance behind.|$|E

50|$|The series heralds a {{new kind}} of writing, {{blending}} both shared universe and collaborative fiction writing in large series fiction. As in other shared universes, the stories are set in a milieu shared with other writers, but usually it's done with other author's stories being set safely somewhere {{off to the side of}} the <b>main</b> story <b>threads.</b> Flint demonstrated that a series could be successfully written by ignoring convention, and deliberately asking the other writers to share in creating the <b>main</b> <b>threads</b> and plot lines of the milieu. The first two novels in the series, 1632 and 1633, were written contemporaneously so that story threads started in one novel could intermingle and generate matching action or background in the other, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The summary {{released}} showed {{major differences}} from the external threats {{thinking of the}} 1992 draft. Two <b>main</b> <b>threads</b> showedthrough the list.

The no-first-use commitment of nuclear weapons was dropped. Secondly, newer dangers were acknowledged; nearby internal wars, the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction, andterrorism.|$|R
60|$|So {{from that}} time forth, Ernest had the small sitting-room entirely to himself, {{whenever}} he was engaged in his literary labours, while Edie and Dot turned the front bedroom {{on the first floor}} into a neat and commodious nursery. As other work did not turn up so rapidly as might have been expected, and as Ernest grew tired after a while of writing magazine articles on 'The Great Social Problem,' which were invariably 'declined with thanks' so promptly as to lead to a well-founded suspicion that they had never even been opened by the editor, he determined to employ his spare time in the production of an important economical volume, a treatise on the ultimate ethics of a labouring community, to be entitled 'The Final Rule of Social Right Living.' This valuable economical work he continued to toil at for many months in the intervals of his other occupations; and when at last it was duly completed, he read it over at full length to dear little Edie, who considered {{it one of the most}} profoundly logical and convincing political treatises ever written. The various leading firms, however, to whom it was afterwards submitted with a view to publication, would appear, oddly enough, to have doubted its complete suitability to the tastes and demands of the reading public in the present century; for they invariably replied to Ernest's inquiries that they would be happy to undertake its production for the trilling sum of one hundred guineas, payable in advance; but that they did not see their way to accepting the risk and responsibility of floating so speculative a volume on their own account. In the end, the unhappy manuscript, after many refusals, was converted into cock-boats, hats, and paper dollies for little Dot; and its various intermediate reverses need enter no further into the <b>main</b> <b>thread</b> of this history. It kept Ernest busy in the spare hours of several months, and prevented him from thinking too much of his own immediate prospects, in his dreams for the golden future of humanity; and insomuch it did actually subserve some indirectly useful function; but on the other hand it wasted a considerable quantity of valuable tenpenny foolscap, and provided him after all with one more severe disappointment, to put on top of all the others to which he was just then being subjected. Clearly, the reading public took no paying interest in political economy; or if they did, then the article practically affected by the eternal laws of supply and demand was at least not the one meted out to them from the enthusiastic Schurzian pen of Ernest Le Breton.|$|E

30|$|To achieve true {{parallel}} pipelining, two buffers {{are used}} to collect samples from the USRP. At any given moment, when one sample-collecting thread is writing to one buffer, the sample-processing thread will be reading from the other buffer. Therefore, once the first batch of samples has arrived, the two <b>main</b> <b>threads</b> work fully in parallel. To ensure that the two <b>main</b> <b>threads</b> do not read and write to the same buffer at the same time, the sample-processing thread needs to work faster than the sample-collecting thread. Hence, within the sample-processing thread, several sub-threads are created to accelerate the processing. The number of threads that {{should be used to}} achieve the best efficiency depends on how many samples the buffer contains and the FFT size. During our experiments, eight processing threads are sufficient to support a sample-collecting thread at the highest sample rate of the USRP (25 Msps). However, for configurations in which only a small amount of samples is collected, the overhead of creating multiple threads outweighs its processing benefit; hence, the sample-processing thread can no longer follow the sample-collecting thread. When this happens, the software detects the overflow of samples and return an error message.|$|R
