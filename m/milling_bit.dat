5000|$|In January 1918, a {{group of}} {{large-scale}} sugar planters gathered in San Fernando, Pampanga to organize a central sugar mill financed from native capital. The group included Jose de Leon, Augusto Gonzalez, Francisco Liongson, Honorio Ventura, Tomas Lazatin, Tomas Consunji, Francisco Hizon, Jose P. Henson, and Manuel Urquico. At that time, foreign capital financed {{the construction of new}} centrals, and the conservative Pampanga planters considered it risky to mortgage their lands to the Philippine National Bank in order to finance the <b>mill.</b> <b>Biting</b> the bullet, the Pampanga Sugar Development Company (PASUDECO) was incorporated in April 1918 and began its first full milling operations in 1922.

5000|$|Flutes / teeth: The flutes of the <b>milling</b> <b>bit</b> are {{the deep}} helical grooves {{running up the}} cutter, while the sharp blade {{along the edge of}} the flute is known as the tooth. The tooth cuts the {{material}}, and chips of this material are pulled up the flute by the rotation of the cutter. There is almost always one tooth per flute, but some cutters have two teeth per flute. Often, the words flute and tooth are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material. So, a 4-tooth cutter can remove material at twice the rate of a 2-tooth cutter.|$|E

While many researchers strive to enable makers to design and produce 3 D objects, our research seeks to present a new fabrication approach to make unique, one-of-a-kind artifacts. To that end, we developed the FreeD, a hand-held digital milling device. The system is guided and monitored by a computer while preserving the maker’s freedom to sculpt and carve, and to manipulate the work in many crea-tive ways.

50|$|Printed {{circuit board}} milling (also: {{isolation}} milling) {{is the process}} of removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a layout file. Similar to the more common and well known chemical PCB etch process, the PCB milling process is subtractive: material is removed to create the electrical isolation and ground planes required. However, unlike the chemical etch process, PCB milling is typically a non-chemical process and as such it can be completed in a typical office or lab environment without exposure to hazardous chemicals. High quality circuit boards can be produced using either process. In the case of PCB milling, the quality of a circuit board is chiefly determined by the system's true, or weighted, milling accuracy and control as well as the condition (sharpness, temper) of the <b>milling</b> <b>bits</b> and their respective feed/rotational speeds. By contrast, in the chemical etch process, the quality of a circuit board depends on the accuracy and/or quality of the photomasking and the state of the etching chemicals.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsScale {{build up}} {{is one of}} the leading reasons for {{production}} decline in oilfields worldwide. Scale can be formed whenever water is produced; either by direct precipitation from the water that occurs naturally in the reservoir rocks, or as a result of produced water becoming oversaturated with scale components when two incompatible waters are mixed downhole. The two most common scales formed in an oilfield are calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Scale can be found in the reservoir, along the wellbore and in the surface process system. There are various methods for controlling scale. The methods shall either prevent scale formation or remove scale that has already occurred. Scale inhibition and choosing the correct injection fluid are two methods for preventing scale formation. Removal of scale can be divided into chemical dissolution and mechanical removal. For chemical dissolution, the alternative is to bullhead the well with chemicals to remove the scale. Mechanical removal includes the use of different equipment e. g. brushes, broaches, string shots and milling. This thesis focuses especially on mechanical wireline milling for removal of scale. Due to this, the wireline rig-up equipment for both platforms and riserless well intervention vessels, has been presented. Wireline milling is a mechanical method which uses a special tool string with a <b>milling</b> <b>bit</b> in the end, to remove scale. Four scale milling case histories from the Smørbukk field in the Norwegian Sea has been studied. They were all performed from a riserless well intervention vessel. Different plots with measurements from one of the case histories, taken during the milling operation have been looked into. The plots contain different measurements such as head tension, current and wireline tension and are plotted against time. The objective of the thesis has been trying to locate parts of the execution of scale milling operations that can be improved. Some of the key findings were: -	When carrying out a scale milling operation; as much as possible information about the scale, and other well conditions, should be obtained before the scale milling start. This can be information about the scale type, where it is located, and the length and thickness of the scale restrictions. Other important information is temperature, pressure and fluid in the well. This information can make the choice of equipment easier and reduce the risk for something going wrong during the operation. To obtain information about the scale restrictions, a caliper can be run in well. -	The weight on bit should be controlled carefully throughout the milling operation. The correct weight on bit is crucial to avoid stalling out with the bit. The consequence of stalling with the bit is no progress in the scale milling, and maybe the need for pulling out of hole with the tool string. -	The removal of scale cuttings is very important during a milling operation. If the cuttings are not sufficiently removed, there will be an accumulation of cuttings around the mill bit and no progress in the milling. -	Real time measurement taken during the scale milling is important for having optimal control over the operation. -	In wells with challenging well conditions, like high temperature and high pressure, pre-testing of equipment for real well conditions, may be important for optimizing the scale milling operation. This can be a good measure to prevent equipment failures and short circuits during the milling operation and decrease the need for tripping in and out of hole more than planned for. -	The effect that acid has on scale is difficult to conclude based on these case histories and should be further investigated. -	The overall experience from the scale milling operations emphasizes the need for a detailed planning of milling operations. Experience, equipment limitations and the different aspects of a milling operation should be thoroughly addressed before one start to mill the scale. This may help to reduce the number of problems during the milling operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} limestone formation {{as well as the}} performance of different tri-cone bits in limestone in Ewekoro. Rock samples were collected from different layers of limestone encountered in the quarry during drilling operation. These samples were tested in the laboratory for uniaxial compressive strength and the tensile strength. Also, the chemical compositions of the samples were determined using the X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and the results were used in the determination of the Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC). The length of the insert buttons {{on the surface of the}} drill bits were measured using digital vernier calliper at regular intervals. In addition, the tooth and bearing wear rates as well as the penetration rate were determined on the field. The results of the uniaxial compressive strength varied from 86. 5 MPa (medium strength) to 112 MPa (high strength). The Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC) of the rock samples varied from 17. 37 % to 36. 676 % while the Rock Abrasivity Index (RAI) varied from 15. 03 to 43. 317. The results of the drilling variables showed that higher wear rate was experienced when <b>milled</b> tooth tri-cone <b>bit</b> was used for drilling than using insert tri-cone bit for drilling limestone formation, hence the tri-cone bits performed optimally well in all the formations except in glauconite (GLAB) where its performance was low. However, the economic analysis indicated that the insert tri-cone bit drilling cost per metre varied from N 660 /m to N 673 /m while the <b>milled</b> tooth tri-cone <b>bit</b> drilling cost per metre varied from N 684 /m to N 710 /m. This will act as a data base for selection of drill bits and drilling equipment in limestone quarries...|$|R
