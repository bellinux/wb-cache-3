500|$|In May 2008, Johansson {{released}} her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, {{which consists of}} one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits' songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics {{found it to be}} [...] "surprisingly alluring", [...] "a bravely eccentric selection", and [...] "a brilliant album" [...] with [...] "ghostly magic". NME named the album the [...] "23rd best album of 2008"; it peaked at number126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson later spoke of the opportunity she had to record the album, adding, [...] "I thought I would do <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> album of standards, because I'm not a songwriter. I'm a vocalist." [...] She started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old. In an interview, Johansson said of Waits, [...] "His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs." ...|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{began his}} career as a {{journalist}} while studying law at the National University of Colombia. In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for El Universal in Cartagena. Later, from 1950 until 1952, he wrote a [...] "whimsical" [...] column under the name of [...] "Septimus" [...] for the local paper El Heraldo in Barranquilla. García Márquez noted of his time at El Heraldo, [...] "I'd write a piece and they'd pay me three pesos for it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> editorial for another three." [...] During this time he became an active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the Barranquilla Group, an association that provided great motivation and inspiration for his literary career. He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon Vinyes, whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude. At this time, García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner. Faulkner's narrative techniques, historical themes and use of rural locations influenced many Latin American authors. The environment of Barranquilla gave García Márquez a world-class literary education and provided him with a unique perspective on Caribbean culture. From 1954 to 1955, García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote for Bogotá's El Espectador. He was a regular film critic which drove his interest in film.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Kill Bill, Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so {{effortlessly}} and brilliantly {{in command of}} his technique that {{he reminds me of}} a virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'– or <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'. I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It's kind of brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Mars had a much thicker, warmer atmosphere early in its history. [...] Much of this early atmosphere would have consisted of carbon dioxide. [...] Such an atmosphere would have raised the temperature, at least in some places, to above the freezing point of water. [...] With the higher temperature running water could have carved out the many channels and outflow valleys that are common on the planet. [...] It also may have gathered together to form lakes and <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> ocean. [...] Some researchers have suggested that the atmosphere of Mars may have been many times as thick as the Earth's; however research published in September 2015 advanced the idea that perhaps the early Martian atmosphere was not as thick as previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I kept waiting for some other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t mean this is a bad song, just <b>maybe</b> <b>an</b> underwhelming one." ...|$|E
