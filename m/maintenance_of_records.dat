50|$|DSOS (Frailey, 1975) {{was one of}} the {{pioneering}} efforts in real-time operating systems. Incorporating many of the principles being introduced at the time in mainframe systems, such as semaphores, memory management, task management and software interrupts, it used a clever scheme to assure appropriate real-time performance while providing many services previously uncommon in the real-time domain (such as an orderly way to communicate with external devices and computer operators, multitasking, <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>records,</b> a disciplined form of inter-task communication, a reliable real-time clock, memory protection, and debugging support). It remained in use for at least three decades and it demonstrated that, if well designed, an operating system can actually make a real-time system faster (and vastly more maintainable) than what had been typical before. Today, almost all real-time applications use operating systems of this type.|$|E
