Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E

Huff-duff used balanced amplifiers that fed {{directly into a}} CRT to instantly display the direction directly from the incoming signal, requiring no <b>mechanical</b> <b>movement</b> of any sort.

25|$|Supercapacitors are {{suitable}} temporary energy storage devices for energy harvesting systems. In energy harvesting systems the energy is {{collected from the}} ambient or renewable sources, e.g. <b>mechanical</b> <b>movement,</b> light or electromagnetic fields, and converted to electrical energy in an energy storage device. For example, it was demonstrated that energy collected from RF (radio frequency) fields (using an RF antenna as an appropriate rectifier circuit) can be stored to a printed supercapacitor. The harvested energy was then used to power an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) circuit for over 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{also have}} a {{regulatory}} role in mechanosensory signaling in proprioceptors and vestibular and auditory hair cells. The protein Whirlin (WHRN) localizes in the post-synaptic neurons of hair cells that transform <b>mechanical</b> <b>movement</b> into action potentials that the body can interpret. WHRN proteins contains three PDZ domains. The domains located near the N-terminus bind to receptor proteins and other signaling components. When the one of these PDZ domains is inhibited, the signaling pathways of the neurons are disrupted, resulting in auditory, visual, and vestibular impairment. This regulation {{is thought to be}} based on the physical positioning WHRN and the selectivity of its PDZ domain.|$|E

40|$|By using a {{piezoelectric}} sensor, it {{was demonstrated}} that the visual evoked potential of a rat brain was accompanied by <b>mechanical</b> <b>movements</b> of the brain when it was excited. A phase of upward movement {{was found to be}} followed by a phase of downward movement. The largest upward movement was a rise in swelling pressure on the order of 100 micro gram, which was about 40 times larger than that of the bullfrog sympathetic ganglion. The waves of <b>mechanical</b> <b>movements</b> were more complicated than those of the evoked potentials. These findings are thought to be {{due to the fact that}} the evoked potentials are propagated from the immediate surroundings of the sensor, while the mechanical signals are produced from anywhere beneath the piezo sensor. The mechanisms of <b>mechanical</b> <b>movements</b> propagated in the brain by electrical stimulation are discussed. Comment: 7 pages,and 3 figure...|$|R

60|$|We may say, {{speaking}} somewhat roughly, that {{a stimulus}} {{applied to the}} nervous system, like a spark to dynamite, is {{able to take advantage}} of the stored energy in unstable equilibrium, and thus to produce movements out of proportion to the proximate cause. Movements produced in this way are vital <b>movements,</b> while <b>mechanical</b> <b>movements</b> are those in which the stored energy of a living body is not involved. Similarly dynamite may be exploded, thereby displaying its characteristic properties, or may (with due precautions) be carted about like any other mineral.
