5|$|On September 10, 2013, a Deep Impact mission {{status report}} {{explained}} that mission controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves {{and so are}} unable to issue any commands to the vehicle's thrusters. As {{a result of this}} problem, communication with the spacecraft was explained to be more difficult, as the orientation of the vehicle's antennas is unknown. Additionally, the solar panels on the vehicle <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> positioned correctly for generating power.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> needed in the forecast process {{at some point in}} the future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E

50|$|In {{aircraft}} flight dynamics, post stall is {{a flight}} {{condition in which}} the aircraft velocity has become lower than stall speed, in order to overcome stalling in the aircraft. In this state —below the low-velocity limit of the flight domain— the wings <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> provide enough lift to compensate the aircraft weight. Some aircraft, such as fighter jets, have enough engine thrust to maintain flight at those speeds. Normal flight controls, such as ailerons and elevators, <b>may</b> then <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to maintain full control of the aircraft.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} pushdown graphs, i. e. infinite graphs {{that can be}} described as transition graphs of deterministic real-time pushdown automata. We consider the case where some vertices are designated as being final and we built, in a breadth-first manner, a marking of edges that lead to such vertices (i. e., for every vertex that can reach a final one, we mark all out-going edges laying on some shortest path to a final vertex). Our main result is that the edge-marked version of a pushdown graph <b>may</b> itself <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> a pushdown graph, as we prove that this enrich graph may have an undecidable MSO theory.

40|$|An {{approach}} to reforestation {{should be one}} which has affinity to cultural values which could insure permanence or sustainability of efforts. In consideration of Filipinos having strong family ties, families could be harnessed as a strong force for tree conservation undertakings.

25|$|Emma {{has decided}} to help Elsa search for Anna. The {{necklace}} leads them to the beach, but Anna is not there.

Elsa weeps and wishes that she could know what happened to Anna and that she could see her again. Suddenly the necklace begins to glow. The necklace is revealed to be the Wishing Star. A trunk appears in the water and Anna and Kristoff emerge as Gerda's message in the bottle for her daughters appears ashore on the beach, but goes unnoticed.|$|R
25|$|General {{newspapers}} {{cover all}} topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> called newspapers.|$|E
25|$|The Nyquist–Shannon {{sampling}} theorem {{provides a}} sufficient {{condition for the}} sampling and reconstruction of a band-limited signal. When reconstruction is done via the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula, the Nyquist criterion is also a necessary condition to avoid aliasing, {{in the sense that}} if samples are taken at a slower rate than twice the band limit, then there are some signals that will not be correctly reconstructed. However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the Nyquist criterion <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> a necessary condition.|$|E
25|$|K. A. Taipale of the World Policy Institute, James Jay Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, and Philip Bobbitt of Columbia Law School, among others, {{have argued}} that FISA {{may need to be}} amended to include, among other things, {{procedures}} for programmatic approvals, as it <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> adequate to address certain foreign intelligence needs and technology developments, including: the transition from circuit-based communications to packet-based communications; the globalization of telecommunication infrastructure; and the development of automated monitoring techniques, including data mining and traffic analysis.|$|E
40|$|Resource {{allocation}} in {{the energy}} sector of the United Kingdom is a difficult area to plan, because demand and supply projections need to embrace both the large private sector oil industry and the public sector fuel industries. In addition, relationships between the latter are complex as they involve both competition and co-ordination. One approach to {{the problem has been}} to find common ground in the concept of marginal cost pricing, but there are practical difficulties in application. Government has encouraged the use of analytical techniques, such as corporate planning, by the fuel industries as a means of co‐ordination in areas where market mechanisms <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> always <b>be</b> effective. ...|$|R

Closed areas are marked by buoys or signs. Fishing in Bonham Pond is permitted only for children under 14 and mobility handicapped persons and is catch and release. Salt Plains Lake is noted for large channel and other catfish. Other game fish include striped bass, largemouth bass, crappie, white bass, panfish, and walleye. State laws apply for bag limits and seasons and the use of boats in the river and creeks is prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|The episode [...] "Old Ironpants" [...] briefly {{features}} General George Armstrong Custer (John Stephenson). Given {{the time}} period (1865 to 1867) in which F Troop <b>is</b> set, Custer <b>may</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have <b>been</b> a general. His commission as a general of volunteers expired on January 31, 1866 and was reduced in rank to captain in the regular Army. A short time later he was made a lieutenant colonel, but given the brevet rank of major general (either way, at least as a courtesy, he could be addressed as [...] "General"). [...] In addition, as Custer departs, Parmenter wishes him luck at his [...] "new assignment at Little Bighorn" [...] (see below).|$|R
