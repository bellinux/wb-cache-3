25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a <b>monthly</b> <b>lease</b> fee in order to use it.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s Orlando, {{like many}} U.S. cites, was {{experiencing}} symptoms of urban decay. [...] The rush {{from the city}} to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses. [...] As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed. [...] Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters. [...] Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing exploitation films and B-movie action films. [...] The next year, H. A. Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long-time lessee Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema. [...] After showing a Sunday double-feature of Return of the Street Fighter, and The Scavengers, the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975. [...] Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the <b>monthly</b> <b>lease</b> of $2700 until the theater was sold.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with most}} {{telephones}} {{of the time}} in the United States, the 500-series telephones were owned by the local Bell Operating Company and <b>leased</b> on a <b>monthly</b> basis to customers. Choices for telephone styles and colors were limited. AT&T, the principal owner of the operating companies and Western Electric, strictly enforced policies against buying and using telephone sets by other manufacturers on their network, to ensure the technical integrity of their network and avoid competition. Most phones made by Western Electric, starting in about 1968, carried this disclaimer molded into their housing: [...] "BELL SYSTEM PROPERTY--NOT FOR SALE." [...] Telephones were also sometimes labeled with a sticker or ink stamp marking the name of the operating company that owned the telephone. After consumers started buying telephones from other manufacturers, in the wake of legal developments not favoring AT&T's ban against third-party equipment, AT&T changed its policy for the Design Line telephone series by selling customers the telephone housing but retaining ownership of the electrical components, so customers were still required to pay AT&T a <b>monthly</b> <b>leasing</b> fee.|$|R
5000|$|In 1953 Hurd {{convinced}} IBM {{management to}} develop {{what became the}} IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data Processing Machine.Although the UNIVAC I (and Ferranti Mark 1 in England) had been introduced earlier than any IBM computer, its high price (while IBM offered <b>monthly</b> <b>leases)</b> limited sales. The lower expense of the 650 meant it could be purchased in much larger quantities. Almost 2000 were produced between 1953 and 1962, to commercial customers as well as academics.On January 19, 1955, Hurd became director of the IBM Electronic Data Processing Machines Division when T.

50|$|In the Netherlands, {{key money}} (sleutelgeld) is a payment without consideration, often {{required}} {{by either the}} landlord or by the vacating tenant.

As the Netherlands experience a shortage in living space (especially in Amsterdam and other large cities in the west), landlords and tenants nevertheless often ask key money despite it being illegal.|$|E
50|$|As a consequence, Bell {{customers}} {{still had}} to pay a <b>monthly</b> <b>lease</b> fee in order to rent the phone's internal components, which remained the property and responsibility of the local Bell provider.

50|$|Financing and leasing {{services}} {{provide a}} means for individuals or companies to acquire goods without any initial capital outlay. Financing is the act of acquiring capital for a purchase or some other activity. Financing services are offered by lenders (a bank or other institution) that provide capital to other individuals or companies {{in the form of}} a loan, which is then paid back within a predetermined time period for a set fee or interest rate. Leasing is the act of entering into a contractual arrangement (i.e. a lease) to obtain temporary possession of an asset (land, equipment, etc.) in exchange for a fixed compensation (for example, a <b>monthly</b> payment). <b>Leasing</b> services are provided by organizations that either manage the lease and payment transactions, furnish the assets or land that is being leased, or both. Financing and leasing services within the context of data center services might include leasing a data center facility; leasing data center equipment, such as servers; or financing a data center project, such as building or upgrading a data center facility.|$|R

30|$|Since 2005, {{a number}} of conservancies {{have been set up}} on the {{communal}} and privatised group ranches adjacent to the MMNR. Conservancies differ in their institutional arrangements; however, the common model found in the Mara occurs on privatised land and illustrates ‘group conservancies’, where groups of landowners have partnered with tourism operators to form a conservancy. The conservancy is primarily set aside for wildlife and tourism but with some controlled livestock grazing allowed. The partnerships involve individual lease agreements between the tourism operators and landowners, the most widespread of which involves landowners receiving fixed <b>monthly</b> land <b>lease</b> payments from the tourism operators, independent of the number of tourists visiting the conservancy (Bedelian 2014). The tourism operators also manage the conservancy and put up high-end tourism camps. Payments are made monthly straight to the bank accounts of individual landowners. In return, landowners must agree to vacate their land, remove settlements and livestock and refrain from any other land use within the conservancy. From an initial two conservancies in 2006, the conservancy model was quickly replicated {{in other areas of the}} Mara and by 2012 had increased to eight conservancies adjacent to the MMNR (Figure  1). In December 2015, there were 17 conservancies reported in the wider Narok County (Reid, RS, D Kaelo, KA Galvin, and R Harmon: Pastoral wildlife conservancies in Kenya: A bottom-up revolution in conservation, balancing livelihoods and conservation?, unpublished).|$|R
