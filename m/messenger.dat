5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat <b>messenger,</b> a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his <b>messenger</b> to save himself. In this account, his <b>messenger</b> took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his <b>messenger</b> saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the <b>messenger</b> fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E

The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike <b>messengers</b> in collisions with other road-users or run-ins with authority figures.

5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a <b>messenger</b> RNA.

The <b>messenger</b> never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship.

5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into <b>messenger</b> RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a {{ribosome}} {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the <b>messenger</b> RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{date the}} origin of the Jazz <b>Messengers</b> to 1954, or 1955, when the first {{recordings}} credited to the band appeared. The Jazz <b>Messengers</b> formed as a collective, nominally led by Silver or Blakey on various dates. Blakey credits Silver with reviving the <b>Messengers</b> name for the group. The other members included Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley and Doug Watkins. Their first recordings officially using the Jazz <b>Messengers</b> name were a pair of live dates, recorded at the Café Bohemia in 1955. A pair of earlier recordings from sessions in late 1954 and early 1955—released on Blue Note 10" [...] LPs as the Horace Silver Quintet, vol. 1 and vol. 2—were subsequently reissued as a 12" [...] LP entitled Horace Silver and the Jazz <b>Messengers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Preliminary. Do not distribute. In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results from}} a {{large-scale}} field experiment with bicycle <b>messengers.</b> We increased the <b>messengers</b> comission rate, their sole form of compensation by 25 percent during four weeks. We find a positive and large intertemporal elasticity for the supply of hours. In response to the wage increase, <b>messengers</b> work roughly 30 percent more shifts than the control group. However, on average, <b>messengers</b> exerted less effort while working, even though the economic model dictates that they also work at a higher pace. It seems that <b>messengers</b> evaluate ”a day at a time”. While working on the higher wage, they were tempted to work less hard, because they earned significantly more during these days than they otherwise would have. In order to provide direct evidence {{for this type of}} isolation of decisions, we ran a follow-up experiment to determine whether <b>messengers</b> isolate decision in other contexts. Consistent with out hypothesis, the results show that only those <b>messengers</b> who isolate decision in the follow-up experiement reduced effort while on the higher wage, whereas the others (about 40 percent of the subjects) kept working at their usual pace. ...|$|R
