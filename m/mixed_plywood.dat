25|$|The Shadow's {{slightly}} tapered wings, {{which have}} down-turned wingtips and leading edges which droop towards the tip, consist of plywood leading edge D-section boxes, built onto <b>mixed</b> <b>plywood</b> and aluminium web shear structures with styrofoam formers. The {{rear of the}} wing is covered in polyester fabric. The wing carries Frise ailerons and three position flaps. The shorter span wings of the later Streak variants are built in the same way, but have no gap between the ailerons and flaps.|$|E
5000|$|The LO 120 S is of <b>mixed</b> construction, using <b>plywood,</b> {{metal and}} {{composite}} materials. The specified engine is the Hirth 2704 of [...] mounted behind the cockpit as a pusher powerplant. The landing gear is tricycle gear.|$|R
2500|$|The I-1 (I = Istrebitel or fighter) was a single-seat, low-wing, wooden aircraft. The first prototype, {{known as}} the IL-400, was {{designed}} around the [...] Liberty L-12 piston engine. It used the radiator and propeller of the Airco DH.9A. The fuselage and wings were covered with a <b>mix</b> of <b>plywood</b> and fabric. The landing gear was braced by wires and the wingtips were protected by tubular curved skids. On the IL-400's maiden flight on 15 August 1923, the aircraft stalled and crashed because its center of gravity was too far aft.|$|R
40|$|MGG’) resin {{adhesives}} for bonding {{wood panels}} were prepared {{by a single}} step procedure, namely reacting melamine with glyoxal and simultaneously with a much smaller proportion of glutaraldehyde. No formaldehyde was used. The inherent slow hardening of this resin was overcome {{by the addition of}} N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone hydrogen sulphate ionic liquid as the adhesive hardener in the glue <b>mix.</b> The <b>plywood</b> strength results obtained were comparable with those obtained with melamine–formaldehyde resins pressed under the same conditions. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight (MALDI ToF) and Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis allowed the identification of the main oligomer species obtained and of the different types of linkages formed, as well as to indicate the multifaceted role of the ionic liquid. These resins are proposed as a suitable substitute for equivalent formaldehyde-based resins...|$|R
50|$|The central nacelle of the LB.2 {{placed the}} seating {{well ahead of}} the wing leading edge and the engine at the {{trailing}} edge. It was a flat sided structure of <b>mixed</b> construction, with <b>plywood</b> covering around the nose and cabin and metal around the engine. Seating was enclosed, with access via fuselage side doors. The flat cabin top continued behind the cabin to the engine housing, where an 82 kW (110 hp) Alfa-Romeo 110-I 4-cylinder inverted air-cooled in-line engine was mounted in pusher configuration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- There is a {{need for}} {{additive}} that enhance the different properties like rheological, tackiness etc. Of the adhesive <b>mix</b> during <b>plywood</b> manufacturing bu using non formaldehyde based adhesive. The present study relates the efficacy study of the natural additive, which is basically fully based on starch and protein available from renewable sources containing a natural tackifier and viscosity enhancer. The adhesive is based predominately on a natural product for example protein, starch based natural material, lignin etc. Thus complementing the use of a lignocelluloses as the primary material. The additive was analysed for physical and chemical properties as per is: 1508 Like PH ash content. Moisture, protein content etc, in order to evaluate the suitability of bond quality and other properties during manufacture of Plywood. 12 mm thickness plywood were manufactured with non Formaldehyde adhesive using natural additive at different concentration and evaluated different physical, che 3 micals properties and board manufacturing condition. Data revels that additive of three to four percent concentration gave satisfactory results in terms or board quality, rheological properties and mechanical properties etc. Five to six percent additive concentration gave excellent result. Addition of higher percent gave unsatisfactory results for manufacturing of ply boards...|$|R
