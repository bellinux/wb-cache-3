5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bone</b> lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some {{openings in}} the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader.

5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities, which are set far to the front. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. Some openings occur in the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not extending between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two foramina (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bone</b> contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E

One of nature’s ways of presenting multiple degree of freedom (dof), vector data is through our audio and vestibular systems. This directional capability is being applied as a human machine interface (HMI) for robotic force sensing.

The bony palate is relatively short, with the mesopterygoid fossa extending {{forward to the}} end of the molar row or even between the third molars. The roof of the fossa is perforated by large sphenopalatine vacuities. Usually, an alisphenoid strut is present; this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The condition of various grooves and foramina of the skull indicates that the pattern of the arterial circulation of the head is derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is large and the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bone</b> is perforated by a fenestra (opening).

500|$|The incisive foramina, {{perforations}} of {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short, not extending between the molars. The {{condition of the}} posterolateral palatal pits is variable, with some individuals having small pits and others having larger pits that may be recessed into a [...] (depression). The palate is moderately long, extending beyond the molars but not beyond the posterior margins of the maxillary bone. In most specimens, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back of the palate, is not perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities and thus it is fully ossified; if present, these vacuities are small. Mindomys lacks an alisphenoid strut; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two openings (foramina) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium.

50|$|Lemierre's {{syndrome}} {{begins with}} an infection {{of the head and}} neck region.

5000|$|Schuller's view is {{a lateral}} {{radiographic}} view of skull principally used for viewing mastoid cells. The central beam of X-rays passes {{from one side}} of the head and is at angle of 25° caudad to radiographic plate. This angulation prevents overlap of images of two <b>mastoid</b> <b>bones.</b> Radiograph for each mastoid is taken separately. The Schullers view serves as an alternative view to the Law projection which uses a 15 degree angle of patient's face toward the image receptor and a 15 degree caudal angulation of the CR to achieve the same result, a lateral mastoid air cells view without overlap of the opposite side. Ear(pinna) under examination can be taped forward to avoid cartilage shadow around mastoid. Older editions of Merrill's positioning books will have detailed explanation of these and other mastoid positions. Newer texts often omit this because of the rarity of this exam in lieu of computed tomography studies.|$|R
40|$|Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) {{is a rare}} extramedullary {{solid tumor}} defined as an {{accumulation}} of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells. It can cooccur with or precede the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as following treated AML. The incidence of GS in AML patients is 3 – 8 % but it significantly rises in M 2 FAB subtype AML. This variety of AML harbors t(8; 21) in up to 20 – 25 % of cases (especially in children and black ones of African origin) and, at a molecular level, it {{is characterized by the}} generation of a fusion gene known as RUNX 1 -RUNX 1 T 1. Approximately 10 % of M 2 AML patients will develop GS, as a consequence, the t(8; 21) and the relative transcript represent the most common cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in GS. FLT 3 -ITD mutation was rarely described in AML patients presenting with GS. FLT 3 ITD is generally strongly associated with poor prognosis in AML, and is rarely reported in patients with t(8; 21). GS presentation is extremely variable depending on organs involved; in general, cranial bones and sinus are very rarely affected sites.

40|$|Vestibulospinal {{reflexes}} can be elicited {{in humans}} by low amplitudes direct (galvanic) currents lasting tens of milliseconds and applied {{across the two}} <b>mastoids</b> <b>bones,</b> which can be delivered by particular stimulators. The stimulus induces a perception of body sway and a postural response appropriate to counteract the perceived sway. Both {{the direction of the}} perceived and induced body sway are modulated by the orientation of the head with respect to the body. This phenomenon {{is due to the fact}} that integration of vestibular and neck signals allows to correctly infer the direction of body sway from the labyrinthine input, which is instead related to direction of head motion. The modulation of stimulus-elicited body sway by neck rotation could be utilised for testing the effectiveness of neck proprioceptive signals in modifying the reference frame for labyrinthine signals from the head to the body. In the present experiments we showed that labyrinthine stimulation can be performed also by using train of pulses of 1 msec duration, which can be delivered by virtually all stimulators allowed for human use. Moreover, we developed a simple technique for visualising the time course of the changes in the direction of the postural response, based on the evaluation of the velocity vector of subject's centre of pressure. This method could be exploited in order to the test the efficacy of neck proprioceptive information in modifying the reference frame for processing vestibular signals in both physiological and pathological condition...|$|R

40|$|Schistosomal myeloradiculopathy (SMR), {{the most}} severe and {{disabling}} ectopic form of Schistosoma mansoni infection, is caused by embolized ova eliciting local inflammation in the spinal cord and nerve roots. The treatment {{involves the use of}} praziquantel and long-term corticotherapy. The assessment of therapeutic response relies on neurological examination. Supplementary electrophysiological exams may improve prediction and monitoring of functional outcome. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) triggered by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a simple, safe, low-cost and noninvasive electrophysiological technique that has been used to test the vestibulospinal tract in motor myelopathies. This paper reports the results of VEMP with GVS in patients with SMR. A cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 22 patients with definite SMR and 22 healthy controls that were submitted to clinical, neurological examination and GVS. Galvanic stimulus was applied in the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bones</b> in a transcranial configuration for testing VEMP, which was recorded by electromyography (EMG) in the gastrocnemii muscles. The VEMP variables of interest were blindly measured by two independent examiners. They were the short-latency (SL) and the medium-latency (ML) components of the biphasic EMG wave. VEMP showed the components SL (p = 0. 001) and ML (p< 0. 001) delayed in SMR compared to controls. The delay of SL (p = 0. 010) and of ML (p = 0. 020) was associated with gait dysfunction. VEMP triggered by GVS identified alterations in patients with SMR and provided additional functional information that justifies its use as a supplementary test in motor myelopathies...|$|R

40|$|Galvanic {{vestibular}} stimulation (GVS) is {{a technique}} in which small currents are delivered transcutaneously to the afferent nerve endings of the vestibular system through electrodes placed over the <b>mastoid</b> <b>bones.</b> The applied current alters the firing rates of the peripheral vestibular afferents, causing a shift in a standing subject 2 ̆ 7 s vestibular perception and a corresponding postural sway. Previously, we showed that in subjects who are facing forward, stochastic bipolar binaural GVS leads to coherent stochastic mediolateral postural sway. The goal of this pilot study was to extend that work and {{to test the hypothesis}} that in subjects who are facing forward, stochastic monopolar binaural GVS leads to coherent stochastic anteroposterior postural sway. Stochastic monopolar binaural GVS was applied to ten healthy young subjects. Twenty-four trials, each containing a different galvanic input stimulus from among eight different frequency ranges, were conducted on each subject. Postural sway was evaluated through analysis of the center-of-pressure (COP) displacements under each subject 2 ̆ 7 s feet. Spectral analysis was performed on the galvanic stimuli and the COP displacement time series to calculate the coherence spectra. Significant coherence was found between the galvanic input signal and the anteroposterior COP displacement in some of the trials (i. e., at least one) in nine of the ten subjects. In general, the coherence values were highest for the mid-range frequencies that were tested, and lowest for the low- and high-range frequencies. However, the coherence values we obtained were lower than those we previously reported for stochastic bipolar binaural GVS and mediolateral sway. These differences may be due to fundamental characteristics of the vestibular system such as lower sensitivity to symmetric changes in afferent firing dynamics, and/or differences between the biomechanics of anteroposterior and mediolateral sway...|$|R
