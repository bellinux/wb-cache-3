5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the <b>medium</b> <b>scale</b> iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|Birbhum is a {{major centre}} of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage {{industry}} is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir. Other main industries in Birbhum are agriculture-based industries, textiles, forestry, arts and crafts. Sriniketan is noted for its dairy industry and as a forestry centre. Some of the notable forms of cottage industries of Birbhum include textile—especially cotton and locally harvested tussar silk, jute works, batik, kantha stitch, macramé (weaving by knotting threads), leather, pottery and terracotta, solapith, woodcarving, bamboo and cane craft, metal works and tribal crafts. There are 8,883 small and <b>medium</b> <b>scale</b> industries. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac harvesting, and metalware and pottery manufacture. Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station (210 MW x 3 + 210 MW x 2 under construction) is the only heavy industry in the district.|$|E

30|$|The patch size {{found in}} our study {{overlaps}} with that found by one other study that examined spatial autocorrelation in fire temperature during low-intensity surface fires. Franklin et al. (1997) found that fire temperatures in upland oak forests were spatially autocorrelated over <b>medium</b> <b>scales</b> (13 to 46 m). These comparisons {{lend support to the}} idea that low-intensity surface fires in longleaf pine are patchy over <b>medium</b> <b>scales,</b> as opposed to the finer scales that may be typical of high intensity fires. Therefore, while the fires examined in our study did not have a narrowly definable patch size, it may be possible that the patch size of fires can be predicted based on fuel type and stand characteristics over more broadly defined scales (< 10 m, 10 – 200 m, > 200 m). More comparative studies that report spatial autocorrelation are needed to examine this.|$|R

40|$|Enterprise {{resource}} planning (ERP) software plays {{a critical}} role in today’s cuttingedge business world. By bringing a company’s different functions together into one large integrated system, an ERPsystem creates a plethora of opportunities for growth and increased productivity. Medium sized enterprises in the developed world are well ahead in their usage of ERP systems. However, the available studies pertaining to the use of ERP systems in developing countries reveal that, the <b>medium</b> <b>scaled</b> businesses in Sri Lanka are far behind in adaptation of ERP systems. Literature reveals that there are many significant factors contributing towards the said low level of adaptation. Out of the many factors identified, the complexity of ERP systems is one of a key contributing factor for the low adaptation of ERP systems in <b>medium</b> <b>scaled</b> enterprises in Sri Lanka. The main objectives of this research are to identify the influencing factors that contribute towards the complexity of ERP for effective implementation, and to establish an ERP complexity index for the advancement of mid-sized companies in Sri Lanka. Further this research established some important recommendations for the acquisition and implementation of ERP systems for medium sized enterprises. The research methodology used was quantitative data gathered via questionnaire surveys of ERP users in <b>medium</b> <b>scaled</b> enterprises in Sri Lanka. Secondary data was gathered from trusted internet sources and from previous researches carried out for information systems applications in Sri Lanka. For the survey 120 ERP users were selected from <b>medium</b> <b>scaled</b> enterprises and from IT experts who possess ERP knowledge and experience. Primary data constituted 91 responses gathered via the online survey published, face to face interviews, telephone interviews and printed copies of the survey, which was used for the sample validation. Outcome of the research identified that the key contributing factors for the complexity of ERP systems are product dimension, people factor, project dimension and company business processes and there is a strong correlation among variables. Complexity analysis survey results revealed that SAP and Oracle records higher complexity index and Microsoft Dynamics and Web ERP records lower complexity indexes. Further secondary data revealed that SAP and Oracle records highest ERP per user cost. ERP’s such as IFS Applications, Dynamics GP, and Sage Accpacc, Web ERP records less ERP per user cost compared to SAP and Oracle. As per the research analysis, customization of ERP system is another key concern apart from the above mentioned complexity and cost analysis in the ERP selection process for <b>medium</b> <b>scaled</b> businesses...|$|R

In the subtropics and tropics the power in ozone drops off more rapidly with increasing frequency than the power in tropopause pressure. Only in the Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes does one find a clear association between increased power in ozone and tropopause pressure and maxima in the coherency spectrum.

25|$|Due to {{the shift}} of {{agriculture}} from self-supporting production to highly intensified cropland systems {{there has been a}} total investment of the Vietnamese Government of ~125 trillion VND in irrigation infrastructure during the last four decades. The constructions built during that time include approximately 100 large to <b>medium</b> <b>scale</b> hydraulic works. Furthermore, there are more than 8000 other irrigation systems (e.g. reservoirs, weirs, irrigation and drainage gates and pumping stations). The main irrigation form used is paddy field irrigation. Whereas gravity irrigation is widely distributed in the Mekong region, in the Central North and coastal regions (3/5 of total irrigation schemes). Irrigation utilizing pumps (electric or with oil engines) is mainly located in the delta regions (~2/3 of total). The other irrigation forms are informal (non-governmental) systems like small private pumps or small gravity diversions. Other investments are made by foreign donors; both foreign and internal investments tend to concentrate on the upgrading and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes.|$|E
