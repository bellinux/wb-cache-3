He wrote: [...] "...my sight waxeth Dymme <b>my</b> hyringe hearing <b>very</b> thycke <b>my</b> speache imperfecte and <b>my</b> memory <b>very</b> feeble". He died in Exeter on 8 November 1601 {{at the age}} of 76 and was buried at St Mary Major, Exeter.|$|R
25|$|In October 2008, a new {{compilation}} album, <b>My</b> <b>Very</b> Best, {{was released}} in Sweden. The double CD contains both Swedish (CD 1) and English-language hits (CD 2) from her whole solo career, from 1967 to 2004. It reached No. 4 on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold within its first week of release.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that If I Were You is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and <b>My</b> <b>Very</b> Own Story.|$|E
25|$|During the {{overland}} journey, {{they stopped}} at Salt Lake City, where Ludlow found an industrious and sincere group of settlers. He brought to the city prejudice and misgiving about the Mormons, and a squeamishness about polygamy which embarrassed him {{almost as much as}} his first view of a household of multiple wives. “I, a cosmopolitan, a man of the world, liberal to other people’s habits and opinions to a degree which had often subjected me to censure among strictarians in the Eastern States, blushed to <b>my</b> <b>very</b> temples,” he writes.|$|E
60|$|He {{regarded}} me for <b>my</b> opinion <b>very</b> earnestly, {{with his}} pipe {{in the corner}} of his mouth.|$|R

25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce <b>my</b> <b>very</b> entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge <b>my</b> <b>very</b> great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is <b>my</b> <b>very</b> sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
60|$|P.S.--I don't write <b>my</b> name <b>very</b> plain, but {{you know}} what it is you know, so never mind.|$|R

500|$|One of <b>my</b> <b>very</b> {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|Lance Henriksen {{performed}} {{all his own}} stunts in this episode, {{having been}} introduced to acting by a stuntman friend of his. The episode opens with a quote from French existentialist philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre—"I am responsible for everything... except <b>my</b> <b>very</b> responsibility", which {{was taken from the}} 1943 treatise Being and Nothingness. Sarte's writing echoes the motivations of the character of Raymond Dees, with author N. E. Genge noting that both believed that [...] "just because the individual was incapable of changing destiny alone was no reason for him to stop trying".|$|E
500|$|David Silverman {{describes}} the episode as [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>very</b> favorite episodes that I {{had the pleasure}} to direct". He notes that several [...] "standard Homerisms" [...] appear {{for the first time}} in the episode, such as Homer's conversations with his brain and his high-pitched [...] "fairy voice". Silverman inserted a red herring into the episode in a scene where Mr. Burns says that he was rejuvenated. Silverman used a close-up of Burns when he says [...] "blood of a young boy" [...] in hopes of misleading viewers into thinking that the rest of episode would be about Burns seeking more of Bart's blood.|$|E
60|$|My fears {{told me that}} {{it might}} be <b>my</b> own <b>very</b> great discomfiture, but I did not say so.|$|R
60|$|THE LADY. I must, really. I {{have done}} <b>my</b> {{business}} <b>very</b> satisfactorily. Thank you ever so much [she proffers her hand].|$|R

500|$|According to Willamette Week, Courtney Love (whose autographed picture {{hangs on}} a club wall) {{is a former}} Mary's Club stripper. Love wrote on the {{photograph}} that she [...] "bought <b>my</b> <b>very</b> first guitar here showing my teeny little titties". Although Christine Jorgensen was also featured at the club, dancers tend to be longtime employees loyal to the family-run business. Keller died in 2006 at age 90; Mary's Club is now run by his daughter, Vicki, who remembered that she first worked there as a seven-year-old waitress. Vicki managed the business for twenty-five years before her father's death, and her daughters worked at the club during that period.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, Lynott {{went on a}} solo {{tour and}} {{released}} his second solo album, which did not sell particularly well. Snowy White left the band in August 1982, having tired of the disorganised schedules and Lynott's drug problems, although {{by his own admission}} he was too restrained and quiet to fit in well with his more raucous bandmates. White went on to achieve top ten chart success in the UK with his single [...] "Bird of Paradise" [...] in 1983. Long-time co-manager Chris O'Donnell also left at this time, later stating, [...] "A once-brilliant band was turning to crap before <b>my</b> <b>very</b> eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside from [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", {{the first}} songs {{selected}} were ones that Harrison had routined for All Things Must Pass but not used: [...] "You" [...] and [...] "When Every Song Is Sung". The latter was originally titled [...] "Whenever" [...] and {{was intended for}} Shirley Bassey, and Harrison had written [...] "You" [...] as what he called [...] "a Ronettes sort of song". The other tracks recorded were [...] "Loverly Laddy Day"; a Harrison–Spector collaboration titled [...] "Tandoori Chicken"; and, according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, [...] "I Love Him Like I Love <b>My</b> <b>Very</b> Life", which they suggest was another Harrison composition. In a 1987 interview with Musician magazine, Harrison spoke of Spector having written some songs for the project, {{one of which was}} [...] "very good, in his pop vein".|$|E
6000|$|This {{consideration}} {{seemed to}} reassure Rose greatly, and her next inquiry was, [...] "Please, are <b>my</b> eyes <b>very</b> red for going home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You loved <b>my</b> mother <b>very</b> much," [...] {{explained}} Ann {{with cold}} deliberation. [...] "She always {{made you think}} of Wordsworth's perfect woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Up {{the aisle}} came <b>my</b> father <b>very</b> erect and solemn, and behind him {{followed}} Falcone with eyes a-twinkle in his weather-beaten face.|$|R
500|$|In February 1948, the {{president}} submitted {{a civil rights}} agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: [...] "My forebears were Confederates... but <b>my</b> <b>very</b> stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten." [...] Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were {{a major factor in}} his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces. [...] In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.|$|E
500|$|With {{aspirational}} lyrics, [...] "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] contains {{themes of}} perseverance, empowerment and [...] "underdog triumphalism". It also showcases ideas of prosocial behavior and [...] "blonde ambition". The lyrics welcome newcomers {{in the music}} industry, [...] "I even hope at one point you take it farther than me", and speak of self-empowerment: [...] "I shall never let 'em see me sweat / Promise to want for more until <b>my</b> <b>very</b> last breath / Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next / And never sell out my soul for any number on a check". According to Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus, the lyrics portray Azalea as [...] "the hardworking Aussie girl and the feminist goddess urging with messianic fervour". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight describes the song as a [...] "bite-sized motivational seminar". [...] "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] was compared to songs by Eminem, specifically from his 2010 album Recovery.|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{was opened}} by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had {{suffered}} 75—80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown {{over her and}} set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. [...] "It {{was clear from the}} outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally." [...] Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: [...] "It is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death." [...] To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: [...] "I offer you, not just on my behalf but on behalf of the whole nation, <b>my</b> <b>very</b> deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|This touched <b>my</b> heart <b>very</b> much, and {{immediately}} I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my recovery from my sickness.|$|R
6000|$|Private Bell, 4th Batt. King's Royal Rifle Corps, 25th Mounted Infantry: 'When the Boers came up {{they took}} <b>my</b> boots off <b>very</b> roughly, hurting <b>my</b> wounded leg <b>very</b> much. I saw them taking watches and money {{off the other}} men.' ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{last words}} were {{reported}} by the San Francisco Chronicle as: [...] "Good-bye. Please dig <b>my</b> grave <b>very</b> deep. All right; hurry up." ...|$|R
