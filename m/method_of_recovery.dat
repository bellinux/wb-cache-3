However, not all substance addictions contain approved medication for treatment. In a conventional addiction psychiatry session, addiction psychiatrists will {{gain a better understanding}} of their patient's lifestyle by gathering medical history and the patient's mental health concerns. Next, the psychiatrist will construct different possible solutions to the patient's problem; if necessary addiction psychiatrists will prescribe medication. Moreover, addiction psychiatrists recommend the benefits of 12-Step programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and often encourage patients to seek external support. Addiction psychiatry can also be a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> for those who have attempted to cease their drug or alcohol abuse without prior success.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Music Box Theatre 2013 Spring Calendar {{film critic}} Mike D'Angelo concludes that [...] "while Upstream Color has {{a fair amount}} of (purely functional) dialogue, it’s {{essentially}} a silent film, obsessed not just with color but with texture and movement and rhythm." [...] He also adds that the [...] "film is a study of damaged people in which both the damage and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> has been made productively strange, allowing Carruth to reclaim some potent ideas that have become clichés". D'Angelo further states that the film is [...] "a dazzling exercise in pure form, with a cinematic syntax that’s confident and exacting yet still feels wildly spontaneous—part Kubrick, part Malick", concluding that the [...] "most exciting aspect of Carruth’s movies, though, in the end, may be the immense respect they afford the viewer. Not only does he refuse to spoon-feed, in the tiresome manner of most Hollywood fare (and even a sizable percentage of indie films), but he continually credits you with the intelligence to infer cause from effect, presenting you with B and trusting that you’ll work out A, which remains firmly offscreen, on your own." ...|$|E
50|$|For {{recovery}}, {{they have}} a recovery system and receivers that permitted overriding the program and flying it 'by hand'. The recovery sequence was triggered by the flight control computer at the preset position, unless overridden by the Drone Recovery Officer (DRO) in the control vehicle. Normally the drone {{was picked up by}} radar as it approached the recovery area and controlled by the DRO. Last minute course corrections were made as necessary and the recovery sequence triggered at the precise point to drop the drone on top of the waiting recovery helicopter. The on-board recovery system consisted of a servomechanism that shut down the engine, deployed a drag chute (to cause the drone to nose over) and opened the main parachute at a preset altitude. The recovery helicopter then flew over the main chute engaging a reinforced catch chute with a set of trailing hooks attached to an internal winch. The drone was then winched up to just below the recovery helicopter and flown back to base. An alternative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> allowed the drone to reach the ground under the main chute. On ground impact a sensor operated a charge that severed the chute risers allowing the drone to be recovered. This method had a higher likelihood of damage and was not preferred.|$|E

40|$|The {{currently}} used linear and nonlinear lens inversion techniques {{are based on}} distortion estimators whose complicated source redshift dependence makes {{the influence of the}} redshift distribution of the sources difficult to take into account and to analyze. However, the lens equations can be explicitly averaged over the source redshift distribution by a suitable choice of the estimators. Lens reconstruction procedures are outlined, which make use of all the information and in which all the unknown quantities of the problem can be recovered simultaneously in both the linear and nonlinear regime, for either noncritical or critical lenses. These procedures require no prior knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sources, but are possibly dependent on the Cosmology in some instances.
