One of the most demanding applications is the recognition of particle tracks that originate from B-quark decays. However, this and many others applications can benefit from parallel execution on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). After the demonstration of accelerated track recognition with big FPGA-based custom computers, the development of FPGA based coprocessors started in the late 1990 's. Applications of FPGA coprocessors are usually partitioned between the host and the tightly coupled coprocessor. The objective of the research that I present in this thesis was the development of software that mediates to applications the access to FPGA coprocessors. I used a software process based on iterative prototyping to cope with the expected changing requirements. Also, I used a strict bottom-up design to create classes that model devices on the coprocessors. Using these low-level classes, I developed tools which were used for bootstrapping, debugging, and firmware update of the coprocessors during their development and <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Measurements</b> show that the software overhead introduced by object-oriented programming and software layering is small. The software-support for six different coprocessors was partitioned into corresponding independent packages, which reuse a set of packages that provide common and basic functions. The steady evolution and use of the software during more than four years shows that the software is maintainable, adaptable, and usable...|$|E

Additionally, it is unknown if changes in SPA, measured in a respiratory chamber, reflect changes in free-living physical activity level (PAL). RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants (N = 48) were randomized into 4 groups for 6 months: calorie restriction (CR, 25 % restriction), CR plus structured exercise (CR+EX, 12. 5 % restriction plus 12. 5 % increased energy expenditure via exercise), low-calorie diet (LCD, 890 kcal/d supplement diet until 15 % weight loss, then weight maintenance), and control (weight <b>maintenance).</b> <b>Measurements</b> were collected at baseline, Month 3, and Month 6. Body composition and RMR were measured by DXA and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Two measures of SPA were collected in a respiratory chamber (percent of time active and kcal/d). Free-living PAL (PAL = total daily energy expenditure by doubly labeled water/RMR) was also measured. Regression equations at baseline were used to adjust RMR for fat-free mass and SPA (kcal/d) for body weight. RESULTS: Adjusted RMR decreased at Month 3 in the CR group and at Month 6 in the CR+EX and LCD groups. Neither measure of SPA decreased significantly in any group. PAL decreased at Month 3 in the CR and LCD groups, {{but not in the}} CR+EX group, who engaged in structured exercise. Changes in SPA in the chamber and free-living PAL were not related. DISCUSSION: Body weight is defended in non-obese participants during modest caloric restriction, evidenced by metabolic adaptation of RMR and reduced energy expenditure through physical activity.

Many variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of biological organization. This includes measurements of body size, mobility or abundance, {{in order to understand}} population dynamics, dispersal behaviour and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. Past studies, however, have used varying methods for <b>maintenance,</b> <b>measurement,</b> and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow cytometry, image and video analyses, and in situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution.

40|$|Ruminant enteric methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} {{account for}} ~ 35 % of New Zealand’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{and a commitment}} has been made for their reduction. Previous research suggested lower CH 4 yields (g/kg dry matter intake; DMI) from sheep fed white clover (Trifolium repens) compared to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne; ryegrass), and the initial focus was to account for that difference. However, measurements undertaken here showed little difference between diets in CH 4 yield. The objective of this thesis was amended to better understand causes of variation in CH 4 emissions from ruminants fed white clover and ryegrass forages. A database analysis showed greater variation in CH 4 yield from sheep fed ryegrass forages with measured intakes using the SF 6 technique, compared to respiration chambers (23. 4 ± 5. 70 vs. 23. 1 ± 2. 90 g/kg DMI). The composition of ryegrass fed to sheep predicted < 2 % and 20 % {{of the variation in}} CH 4 yield when derived from SF 6 and respiration chamber techniques, respectively. For cattle, the database of CH 4 yields determined by SF 6 found ryegrass composition accounted for 13 % of the variation. Measurements in respiration chambers of CH 4 yield from sheep in three experiments reported here, had similar values for white clover and ryegrass (22. 6 g/kg DMI), despite higher concentrations of fibre and less crude protein in ryegrass. Feed composition predicted less than 19 % of variation in CH 4 yield. Measurements of CH 4 emissions from sheep fed white clover or ryegrass at multiples of 0. 8 to 2. 5 the metabolisable energy requirements for maintenance (MEm) showed a decline in CH 4 yield of 3. 47 g/kg DMI for each multiple of MEm intake above <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of rumen function and digesta kinetics, suggested the rate of liquid flow through the gastro-intestinal tract, and molar percentages of propionate were the main drivers of a change in CH 4 yield with intake. This research has shown minor effects of forage composition on CH 4 yield, and has highlighted the importance of digestive function to account for effects of intake and individual variation on methanogenesis. The benefits of high feed intakes for production will be complemented by a low CH 4 yield and low emissions per unit of production...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{management}} of maintenance process {{is critical for}} economic viability and a long term survival of many industries. In fact, an effective and efficient maintenance process is a must for most of industries to assure asset performance often measured in in terms of high asset availability, high level of safety and good quality, besides value addition. With this recognition, the <b>measurement</b> of <b>maintenance</b> performance has become {{an essential element of}} strategic thinking of asset owners and asset managers. The area of <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> is new and emerging. This is even truer for heavy and capital intensive industries. However, measuring maintenance performance is a complex issue and in practice more difficult than measuring the performance of the business or organisation in terms of total out put due to involvement of many intangibles and difficulty in tracing back the business results to investments and other input to maintenance process. It is important that factors influencing the performance of maintenance process should be identified; and measured, {{so that they can be}} monitored and controlled for improvement. There are various concepts proposed by researchers for measuring maintenance performance. Some of the concepts used in defining maintenance metrics are unclear of what to measure, how to communicate maintenance performance towards organizational targets, aligning maintenance performance with business goals and strategies. Such ambiguities of maintenance performance are mainly due to not considering complexities involved in breaking down the corporate objectives into measurable targets at the shop floor level; and similarly, aggregation of the measured maintenance performance from shop floor level to the corporate objectives. There is a need to identify factors influencing maintenance performance and analyse various related issues and to develop a framework, which can systematically address these critical issues. Such framework needs to incorporate interrelationship between various factors influencing performance, include desired performance indicators and if possible show their aggregation into key performance indicators (KPIs) at higher level, etc. across strategic, tactical and operational hierarchical levels of the organization. The scope of this research is to study and analyze different concepts, proposed by researchers in this field and as also followed by the industries. To understand and get a clear picture of performance <b>measurement</b> and especially <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement,</b> an extensive literature study is undertaken. Unfortunately, not much literature is available for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement.</b> Furthermore, an attempt has been made to define various terms and metrics useful for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurements.</b> Using the theoretical frame of reference the interrelationship between influencing factors are studied at various level in an organisation and a general multi-criteria hierarchical framework for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> is proposed. The proposed framework considers stakeholders’ need, business environment and other relevant factors influential to maintenance effectiveness of the organization. Current practices of two organisations, one in the process industry and the other one in the utility (service) industries are studied in detail and compared against the framework developed in this research. Maintenance performance indicators for nuclear power, oil and gas and railway industries from published literature are also studied and discussed. This research shows that a multi-criterion hierarchical framework for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> is useful in deciding maintenance policies, procedures and working instructions to monitor and control maintenance effectiveness across various plants and across the industry. Tailor made approaches in developing indicators to address specific stakeholders concern and inform the {{management of}} future approaches are recommended. Managing information is key to managing the performance of maintenance effectively. Therefore, application of new and emerging technology such as ICT and implementation of e-Maintenance concept is suggested. The contributions of this study can be summarized are: * Terms and concepts useful for maintenance performance management, performance measurement, indicators and metrics are discussed and defined. * An analysis of factors influencing maintenance performance in industrial environment is presented. * Issues and challenges associated with the <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> are identified, discussed and suggestions are made to deal with them. * Identified relevant maintenance performance indicators for measuring performance at strategic and operational level. * A general multi-criteria hierarchical framework for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> applicable to a wide range of industries is developed.

40|$|Purpose – Value driven {{maintenance}} (VDM) is {{a fairly}} new maintenance management methodology based on four maintenance value drivers and the formula of net present value (NPV) to calculate the value of different maintenance strategies. However, the dependability of the engineering assets needs to be assessed {{in order to make}} an estimation of the NPV. Therefore, standardised indicators have been critically analysed to find the most essential indicators for the four value drivers and for estimation of the NPV. Terminology containing performance drivers and killers are common in the field of asset management, but not many publications can be found for their detailed descriptions. One section in this paper is therefore dedicated to review these terms. A comprehensive description and classification of performance killers and drivers, and of indicators for VDM are presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach – Review of literature for technical terminology and review of standards for identification of indicators for <b>maintenance</b> performance <b>measurement</b> and NPV of maintenance.

In order to determine the robustness of this continuously growing class of lighting devices we arranged an experiment of accelerated aging: the four groups of LEDs (from different manufacturers) were submitted to a series of stress tests in environmental chambers with set-point temperatures ranging from 45 °C to 105 °C, in accordance to the IES LM- 80 - 08 lumen <b>maintenance</b> <b>measurement</b> standard. The experimental data gathered all along the 4000 h of stress accumulated up to now suggest the presence of multiple degradation mechanisms that may limit the useful lifespan of the light-emitting diodes under test. In particular we observed the following phenomena: i) a decay of the luminous flux; ii) an increase in the reverse and forward leakage current; iii) the worsening of the chromatic properties of the emitted light; and iv) the presence of a thermally activated degradation mechanism.

Consequently, rail utilisation is increasing, adding stress to the rail infrastructure and time constraints to maintenance. At the same time, the performance and capacity of rail infrastructure {{are expected to be}} preserved or even improved. Railway performance and capacity can be enhanced by: expanding infrastructure; introducing better technology; and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operation and <b>maintenance.</b> Performance <b>measurement</b> has shown to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations, but the development and integration of performance measurements are essential. A key issue in performance measurement is the process of collecting, storing and converting data into information and knowledge, i. e. data analysis and presentation. Organisations use various systems and methods to collect and analyse data, but the analysis of the collected data to extract relevant information is often a challenge. With improved data analysis and performance measurement, rail transportation can meet the requirements of performance and capacity. Specifically, maintenance planning and optimisation of preventive maintenance can be made more effective, which can decrease interruptions of train operation, reduce costs and ensure safety. In this project, methods for measuring maintenance performance of rail infrastructure are developed. The work aims to facilitate decision-making in rail infrastructure maintenance.
