5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod. The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, and changed the original cover art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> art creator.|$|E
5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E

25|$|The ricasso or {{shoulder}} identifies a short {{section of}} blade immediately below the guard {{that is left}} completely unsharpened. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the German Zweihänder, a <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might grip it in one hand to wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter combat.|$|E
25|$|The {{body and}} pin meet at either a spring or hinge. The {{earliest}} design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around {{in one direction}} only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs that wind around to {{both sides of the}} fibula body, appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending {{from one end of the}} spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.|$|E

[...] During the Sad Wings sessions, Howells encouraged the band {{to work on}} a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> of [...] "Diamonds & Rust" [...] by folk singer Joan Baez, but it did not appear on the album. [...] The band had a hit in the UK with a re-recording of the cover version the following year, after they had moved to CBS Records. [...] Gull released the version from the Sad Wings sessions in 1978 on the compilation album The Best of Judas Priest.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} locomotive was the high-set Nclass boiler, which was pitched [...] above the frames to accommodate the inside cylinder assembly, potentially exposing the conjugation mechanism to the elements. To prevent corrosion, Maunsell incorporated a vertical <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> above the front buffer beam to protect the inside cylinder and valve gear assembly, the main visual difference from the Nclass. Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard Nclass chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders. To mitigate this, a wider-diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide-diameter cast chimney. The rest of the construction process followed the 1919 N1 specification, and the final {{three members of the}} order for 15 Nclass locomotives were built as intended. The N1 prototype was completed in December 1922 and attached to a standard Maunsell [...] flat-sided Ashford Nclass tender. It entered service on 24 March 1923 and the boiler pressure was reduced from [...] to [...] for No.822's fuel consumption to be compared with that of the 2-cylinder Nclass during trials.|$|E
500|$|Hermética toured Patagonia at the {{beginning}} of 1993. In March that year, Ácido Argentino was certified gold by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF), having shipped 30,000 copies in Argentina. Tripoli invited them to produce a new studio album in Miami or Los Ángeles but the band refused, preferring to stay in Argentina. Hermética was scheduled to support Megadeth, but their guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine had health problems which forced the band to cancel the concert. They received proposals to play with Metallica, but rejected the required terms of the contract. After touring in Rosario and Greater Buenos Aires, Hermética performed their first concert in Buenos Aires on May 15, 1993, at Stadium, a new concert hall with a capacity of 5,000. They recorded the live album En vivo 1993 Argentina and a home video. The album included a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> version of [...] "Si se calla el cantor", a song first recorded by folk singer José Larralde. This album ended the contract with Radio Trípoli, which was renewed. Hermética performed at the Olmos penal facility on August 17, along with Lethal, A.N.I.M.A.L., Massacre, Attaque 77, Pilsen and the British U.K. Subs. The concert was presented by the radio host Norberto Verea, and was recorded and released on a live CD named [...] "Radio Olmos". The band performed another concert at Stadium on September 4, and began to produce their third studio album.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} before Slipknot formed, a state of {{shifting}} band membership existed throughout the metal scene in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1991, the biggest metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with Jim Root on guitar. Drummer Joey Jordison founded a thrash metal band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist Craig Jones. Drummer Shawn Crahan formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing funk <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> songs at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played death metal with Anders Colsefni on drums, Paul Gray on bass, and Josh Brainard on guitar and vocals. Colsefni later took over vocal duties, but Vexx never recorded. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could jam. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Pat Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray's basement, discussing possible band names such as Pull My Finger, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled [...] "Slipknot"; another was titled [...] "Painface", which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.|$|E
500|$|On July 13, 2009, Tori Amos {{covered the}} song live during her Sinful Attraction Tour at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California. On October 15, 2009, Kris Allen covered the {{song for the}} first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His {{rendition}} received positive reviews. The song is heard, prominently but briefly, during the climactic fight-scene in the 2005 animated film Robots. Fender, while wearing a skirt, was busy fighting to the beat of the song. An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album Kids Superhits. The same year, British death <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their Return of the Ten Masked Men album. A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film Ready to Rumble. In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the remake film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was [...] "really, really, dark and really rock, [...] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that we usually do." [...] In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is [...] "as redolent and fetching as any of 's peaks". Japanese pop singer Shiori Takei covered the song of her 2005 album The Note of My Nineteen Years.|$|E
500|$|Wrapped {{and sealed}} in a {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) Mylar bag, Sex contains 128pages and is spiral bound with an aluminium cover {{that has the}} word [...] "Sex" [...] stamped {{in the middle and}} a warning label. The front page also shows Madonna against a sky blue backdrop. Three different types of paper were used for the printing of Sex and the design was overseen by Madonna and Baron & Baron Inc. (consisting of Fabien Baron and the photographer Siung Fat Tjia) who had previously collaborated with the singer designing the cover art of her fifth studio album, Erotica. As this was the first project for Maverick, the packaging was crucial; however Madonna did not have faith in Warner Book's [...] "mass-market" [...] publication process. Hence Baron suggested to transfer the packaging job to Nicholas Callaway's bespoke Callaway Editions. Charles Melcher, co-publisher with Callaway for the book, said that they usually did [...] "exquisite art books, $100 high end, beautiful things". But it was a challenge for them to process Madonna's ideas into reality. The artist wanted the packaging to be sealed, so that the reader had to tear it up and read. They considered various kinds of clasps before zeroing on the idea of the sealed bag as a reference to a condom package. The <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> was Madonna's idea, who took the inspiration from the 1979 album, Metal Box by the band Public Image Ltd. Melcher recollects, [...] "We were talking about materials for the cover, and we went into her kitchen. [...] pointed at the metal plate {{at the back of her}} stove and said, 'I want something like this'. I was very impressed with the way she interacted with her world to source things." [...] The company bought about [...] of aluminium, a pound for each book. The designers had to do the front and the back covers, while rolling, stamping and ionizing the metal.|$|E
