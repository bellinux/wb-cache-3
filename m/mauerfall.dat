40|$|Zwanzig Jahre nach dem <b>mauerfall</b> ist der strukturelle Umbruch des ostdeutschen Bildungssystems längst vollzogen. Die gesellschaftstheoretische Interpretation der postsozialistischen Transformation ist indes noch nicht zum Abschluss gekommen. Vor allem die unterschiedlichen Verläufe in verschiedenen osteuropäischen Ländern rufen nach einer Erklärung. Der Autor stellt hierzu zwei »Interpretationsangebote« aus der Transformationsforschung vor, deren jüngerer, "kontextsensitiver" Ansatz geeignet erscheint, die Formen des Wandels, auch der Weiterbildung, zu erklären. This article proposes two interpretational {{approaches}} which sociological transformation research {{offers to}} reflect on east German transformation processes after reunification. (1) Taking the concept of transformation as modernisation catching up, a picture is painted of a society going through inevitable modernisation processes with a time delay. (2) from the theoretical perspective of contextualisation, transformation {{is seen as an}} objectless, complex, conflict-prone process during which eastern professionals re-shape western institutions in the light of regional, social and cultural conditions. The author favours this "contextsensitive" interpretation of post-socialist transformation processes. It provides a plausible explanation for the variety of transformation processes in eastern European countries. The article is set in the framework of continuing education: at the start, it depicts the state of research into eastern German continuing education after 1989, and at the end the author comments on how transformation research has been received in continuing education research...|$|E
40|$|The Cold War’s end infused {{electronic}} music from Detroit and Berlin in the early-to-mid- 1990 s with an unrivalled intensity. The events around the <b>Mauerfall</b> provided conditions for encounters between Detroit techno producers and a nascent Berlin scene celebrating a new – short-lived – openness. Cemented in Berlin’s Wende era, techno reached across decades-old geopolitical barriers between divided Berlin and the Fordist heartland of the American Dream. This essay {{argues that the}} music brought together enthused communities to live out energetic experiments in conditions informed by past suffering {{and hope for the}} future. In Berlin, displaced Cold War identifications met the placelessness of Detroit techno’s utopian-dystopian form. Detroit techno and re-unification met on this territory, where a social imaginary of radical difference strongly appealed, and experiments with social forms seemed possible. The music had long explored a placelessness that left behind earlier struggles, connecting it with the “transitional” experience of the Wende. Berlin’s nascent club scene became the place to play out Detroit techno’s alienated relation to identity. The article foregrounds alienation within Detroit techno and techno’s break with the past via Afrofuturism. In Berlin, Detroit techno becomes a trace of the future in a setting dedicated to the future’s exploration. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
