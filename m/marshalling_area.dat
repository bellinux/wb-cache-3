500|$|On 25 May 1944, No. 4 Commando {{arrived in}} Southampton. They {{occupied}} a large <b>marshalling</b> <b>area</b> with tight security. Orders detailed {{their role in}} the invasion. [...] "The two French troops would attack and destroy a strong point that dominated the beaches known as the Casino, followed by the five British fighting troops, supported by the heavy weapons troop, who were to push on further into the town to destroy a coastal battery." [...] The German defenders in the area came from the 1st Battalion, 736th Infantry Regiment part of the 716th Infantry Division.

500|$|Evans brashly {{took the}} {{opportunity}} to attempt to regain the psychological ascendancy from Goodhew, confronting him privately and stating that [...] "we will win it", later reporting that the Briton was astounded by his posturing. The eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, Tonelli convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his compatriots to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the [...] "Quietly Confident Quartet" [...] because they exhibited a reserved self-belief as they lined up for the race. Whereas most of the other teams were [...] "psyching up" [...] in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>area,</b> the Australians were remaining light-hearted and placid, confident that they could perform in the water.|$|E

2500|$|While in England, the {{battalion}} was first {{attached to the}} 1st Infantry Division on 21 April 1944, an association which they would maintain throughout the war on the continent. The battalion moved from their <b>marshalling</b> <b>area</b> near Weymouth, England, to embarkation craft from 31 May â€“ 2 June 1944. It would join the assault force on D-Day with Task Force [...] "O" [...] for Operation Neptune, with the Reconnaissance Platoon hitting Omaha Beach at about 1220 and B Company landing about 1500 on 6 June 1944.

2500|$|Southampton was at {{the heart}} of Area C, a huge <b>marshalling</b> <b>area</b> in {{southern}} Hampshire, which extended as far north as Winchester. Detailed maps of the time show that within Area C, Sub area Z extended around the north of Southampton and as far as Hedge End in the east. There were military camps on the common, Harefield, Thornhill, and Netley Common. The maps even show that there were Chemical Warfare dumps to the north of the town.The town centre, the docks, Woolston and Weston were part of Embarkation Area C5. The plan was that troops and equipment would be assembled in the camps in sub-areas W, X, Y and Z then brought to the embarkation area to be loaded aboard the ships that were waiting there. That plan was tested in May 1944, during Operation Fabius, with troops that passed through Southampton rehearsing their landings at Hayling Island, Bracklesham Bay and Littlehampton ...|$|E

2500|$|Precast {{segmental}} linings in {{the main}} TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key. On the French side, a [...] diameter [...] deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a <b>marshalling</b> <b>area</b> was [...] below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff - same place as the marine tunnels - not from Folkestone. The platform {{at the base of}} the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda in Loch Linnhe on the west coast of Scotland.|$|E

This reclamation from the sea at Thorndon began in 1923 and was on track {{to be completed by}} 1932, which allowed the government in 1929 to confirm that Bunny Street would be the location of a new station which would remove the inconvenience of the two separate stations.|$|R
