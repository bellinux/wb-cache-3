50|$|Many factors {{affect the}} quality of service of a mobile network. It is correct to look at QoS mainly from the customer's point of view, that is, QoS as judged by the user. There are {{standard}} metrics of QoS to the user that can be measured to rate the QoS. These metrics are: the coverage, accessibility (includes GoS), and the audio quality. In coverage the strength of the signal is measured using test equipment and this can be used to estimate the size of the cell. Accessibility is about determining the ability of the network to handle successful calls from <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> networks and from mobile-to-mobile networks. The audio quality considers monitoring a successful call {{for a period of time}} for the clarity of the communication channel. All these indicators are used by the telecommunications industry to rate {{the quality of}} service of a network.|$|E
40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that mobile network operators are monopolists when {{they set the}} termination rate for the calls made to their own network. Since the <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> termination rates are usually regulated at cost and the fixed network operator has the obligation to terminate the incoming calls, therefore the fixed provider can neither threaten to raise the <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> termination charge, nor threaten to refuse to terminate the call. Hence, mobile network operators can fix high fixed-to-mobile termination rates. We propose a policy to overcome this termination bottleneck imposing reciprocity between the <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> and fixed-to-mobile termination rates and relaxing the interconnection obligation. First, we consider a benchmark where mobile-tofixed termination rates are regulated at cost and fixed and mobile network operators negotiate the fixed-to-mobile termination rate. We show that fixedto-mobile termination rates depend negatively on the MTM termination rate and positively on the intensity of competition in the mobile sector. Moreover, imposing reciprocity on termination rates total welfare increases {{with respect to the}} benchmark...|$|E
40|$|In {{a context}} of partial fixed-mobile substitution, we analyze fixed-mobile {{bundling}} and <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> off-loading in a duopoly model in which consumers buy one or two products. A joint purchase discount mitigates fixed-mobile substitutability and consequently reduces mobile-only and fixed-only consumers. Practises like introducing a small discount, applied on a bundle of multiple service or <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> offloading by both operators are analysed. We find that such practises do not have negative impacts on the profits of whole market and lead to both consumers' surplus and welfare gains. The investment incentives in fixed network are positive and can be boosted by FM bundling without considering regulatory intervention and before taking into account of fixed costs. The investment incentives in mobile network are more likely a situation of prisoners' dilemma where operators should invest {{as long as there}} are mobile-only consumers...|$|E
40|$|I derive Ramsey optimal {{prices in}} one-way access of long-distance {{operators}} and enhanced service providers to local loops. As long-distance services and enhanced services become substitutes {{due to the}} advance of Internet telephony, the Ramsey principle requires higher access charges assessed on both services. I also derive Ramsey prices in two-way interconnection between fixed-link and mobile phone networks, which {{turn out to be}} formally equivalent to those for the one-way access above. This result suggests that the price of fixed-to-mobile calls should be higher than the price of <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> calls when the substitutability of calls to double subscribers is more prominent than the substitutability of calls of double subscribers, and vice versa. ...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical signals {{acting on}} the nucleus can {{regulate}} gene expression. Despite the inherent affinity of nucleic acids and nuclear proteins (e. g. transcription factors) for protons, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that regulate nuclear pH (pHnuc), and how these could be exploited to control gene expression. Here, we show that pHnuc dynamics can be imaged using the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342. Nuclear pores allow the passage of medium-sized molecules (calcein), but protons must first bind to mobile buffers in order to gain access to the nucleoplasm. Fixed buffering residing in the nucleus of permeabilized cells was estimated to be very weak on the basis of the large amplitude of pHnuc transients evoked by photolytic H(+) -uncaging or exposure to weak acids/bases. Consequently, the majority of nuclear pH buffering is sourced from the cytoplasm in the form of mobile buffers. Effective proton diffusion was faster in nucleoplasm than in cytoplasm, in agreement with the higher <b>mobile-to-fixed</b> buffering ratio in the nucleus. Cardiac myocyte pHnuc changed in response to maneuvers that alter nuclear Ca(2 +) signals. Blocking Ca(2 +) release from inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptors stably alkalinized the nucleus. This Ca(2 +) -pH interaction may arise from competitive binding to common chemical moieties. Competitive binding to mobile buffers may couple the efflux of Ca(2 +) via nuclear pores with a counterflux of protons. This would generate a stable pH gradient between cytoplasm and nucleus that is sensitive to the state of nuclear Ca(2 +) signaling. The unusual behavior of protons in the nucleus provides new mechanisms for regulating cardiac nuclear biology...|$|E
