5|$|Totti's {{years under}} Zdeněk Zeman {{represented}} {{a period of}} both physical and <b>mental</b> <b>maturation</b> as a player. From a technical and tactical standpoint, he proved to be compatible on the left wing in the rigid formations of the Bohemian coach, as his new role gave him more space to take on defenders in one on one situations, and cut into the centre to shoot on goal with his stronger foot; he also became physically more powerful, fit, hard-working, and complete. He displayed a greater responsibility for the team, and was presented with the number 10 jersey. His first season under Zeman started well, with Totti {{taking advantage of a}} 4–3–3 formation and making his breakthrough with the club. He finished the league season reaching double figures in goals scored {{for the first time in}} his career; including a goal in the club's 2–0 away win against Napoli on 22 February 1998, Totti scored 13 goals in Serie A in total, and contributed to Roma's fourth place league finish that year. Although he was not called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup by Italy manager Cesare Maldini, his consistent performances, creativity and goalscoring throughout the course of the previous Serie A season saw him being awarded the Guerin d'Oro for the 1997–98 season, given to him for having achieved the highest average rating of any Serie A player. The following season, he began to gain recognition as a club symbol and as a leader, and on 31 October 1998, Totti became the official team captain, and the youngest Serie A club captain ever at the age of 22, inheriting the armband from Aldair. On 29 November 1998, Totti scored the equalising goal in a 3–3 draw against cross-city rivals Lazio; this was his first ever goal in the Rome Derby. Overall, he scored 30 goals and provided 26 assists during Zeman's two-year managerial stint. For his performances, he was named the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year for the 1998–99 season.|$|E

Because the ability to perform cycling skills {{is based on the}} age-related development of the child, experience and age-related reference values are of interest in light of customized testing and training. Methods: One hundred thirty-eight children from the second (7 - 8 years), fourth (9 - 10 years), and sixth (11 - 12 years) grades performed a practical bicycle test consisting of 13 test items with specific points of interest. Moreover, age at onset of cycling, cycling to and from school, independent mobility, and minutes cycling per week were estimated using a parental questionnaire. Results: It is found that cycling skills are strongly related to age with 11 - to 12 -year-old children outperforming 7 - to 8 -year-old children for 11 test items and 9 - to 10 -year-old children for 8 test items. Conclusions: Next to age, age at onset of cycling also contributed to cycling skills. Therefore, our results suggest that cycling skills are associated with physical and <b>mental</b> <b>maturation.</b> Subsequently, age-related reference values are provided to customize testing and training...|$|E

Only 10 % of the Idjwi cretins are clinically euthyroid, and most of those are deaf-mute and spastic. Studies on 21 typical myxedematous cretins showed lower 131 I uptake and PBI than euthyroid controls from the same area, marked retardation in bone maturation, epiphyseal and metaphyseal dysgenesis and failure of modeling. The bone changes were consistent with hypothyroidism appearing by birth or during the first months of life. Electrocardiograms showed low voltages of the QRS complexes and T waves. Extremely high blood TSH levels indicated primary hypothyroidism. Thyroid scannings showed small glands in normal position. Some showed nonhomogeneous localization of the radioiodine suggesting a degenerative process. Thus, most of the cretins in the Idjwi goiter endemia are myxedematous, possibly as a result of a degenerative process of the thyroid gland occuring by birth or in early infancy.

40|$|Background: Puberty is {{transformation}} of the child into an adult. It includes all the events of somatic and <b>mental</b> <b>maturation.</b> Secondary sex characters were {{also a part of}} this period. The objective was to assess the pattern of sexual maturation of adolescent school girls in rural India. Methods: This was a community based cross sectional study conducted among school children of Sevanand High school, Mahadula, Nagpur. 322 girls in the age group of 10 - 18 years were assessed for sexual maturation. The pubertal evaluation was made with reference to Tanner stages and grading was done as per Tanner’s scale. For statistical analysis, median and standard error along with 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Epi Info statistical package programme version 6. 0 updated 2009. Statistical significance was assessed at a type I error rate of 0. 05. Results: We found that pubertal changes appeared earlier in girls. The first to appear was breast development at a median age of 10. 40 years. The last to appear was pubic hair development (PH 5) at median age 16. 87 years, the total time taken for complete sexual maturation being 6. 38 years. Median age of menarche was found to be 13. 18 years.

I visited many schools where I could observe and teach these children even for a short time; a day or a weekend, {{and in some cases}} making repeated visits covering a period of time. I travelled widely so that schools would be representative of differing communities. I travelled widely in the United States of America, visiting schools for slow lemming und otherwise handicapped children and depart-ments of special education in colleges and universities, so that I could learn somethingin a variety of State systems of American special educatian and the uses made of expressive work. These visits and investigations both here and in America confirmed my belief that the arts and all expressive work are of major importance for all children, but particularly for the children who are failing in school and particularly at this time in the progress of our educational system. I read widely, investigating our knowledge of learning processes and medical research on such problems as brain damage, and physical and <b>mental</b> <b>maturation.</b> I had opportunity for discussion with medical colleagues on such subjects as obesity and metabolism, causes and detection of pre-natal, peri-natal and post-natal brain damage, and the early detection of partial sightedness and deafness. I investigated the nature of maladjustment in children and its link with educational subnormality, and this led me to the relationship between subnormality and delinquency. I visited factories, observing the nature of the work which might be possible for the children with whom I am concerned and discussing with personnel managers the progress and difficulties encountered by some of their less able employees. I was led to study many relevant problems, such as that of measurement and competition in education, the difficulties of acquiring the right teachers with the system of remuneration we have operating, and the place of the least able children in comprehensive schemes. The first part of the study concerns the situation as I saw it and the related problems. The second part indicates the ways in which I believe teachers could use the expressive arts and allied activity to help these children to grow in personality and liveliness and to acquire the interest in find need far language, which may lead to a lasting literacy for them. Throughout these five years I have continued to study the expressive arts which seem to be most clearly concerned {{and the ways in which}} they can be applied to the teaching of these children. These arts are: movement and dance, drama, music, painting, modelling and creating with materials of all kinds, and the world of literature used in ways which do not necessitate the ability to read and write fluently.

40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{psychiatric}} disorders of childhood. Despite a long history, widespread clinical acceptance, and extensive research, the diagnosis and treatment are still controversial. The aim of the thesis was to study the hypothesis that some children with ADHD may show these symptoms due to a slow speed of <b>mental</b> <b>maturation</b> with the possibility of a catch-up. · In Study I, the association between ADHD and global maturity was tested using a twin design (incl. 1106 pairs of the 1480 pairs of twins born in Sweden Apr. 1985 - Dec. 1986). The results showed different pathways through which genetic effects may influence the behavior pattern in children with ADHD. Among boys, there are at least two different genetic pathways to explain ADHD, one through predisposition for maturational lag and one specific to ADHD. A different pathway may explain ADHD in girls. · In Study II, the relationship between behavior, ADM symptoms and maturity was studied among 1079 pairs of twins from study I using a questionnaire (a global maturity parent's scale) given to the parents. Relationships were found between the maturity factor and the CBCL grouping of syndromes (internalizing, externalizing, total behavior problems score) as well as between the maturity factor and ADHD. From the parents' point of view the behavior problems in their children may be related to maturity. · In Study III, a computerized tool, the Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS) was used to test concentration and impulse control comparing 71 children with ADHD (61 boys, 10 girls; mean age 10. 5 y) and 98 controls (65 boys, 23 girls; mean age 10. 2 y). Differences were found between ADHD children and age- matched control children in each age group. The GDS scores were highly correlated with age with better a performance among the older children, which could support the relevance of the maturational lag hypothesis. · In Study IV a possible immature brain processing during concentration was studied comparing 36 children with ADHD (31 boys, 5 girls; mean age 10. 5 y) and 63 controls (46 boys, 17 girls; mean age 10. 0 y). QEEG techniques were used when the children performed the Vigilance Task of GDS. Compared to controls children with ADHD displayed specific differences in the pattern of frontal, temporal, and parietal brain activation. They had an enhanced slow cortical activity and decreased fast activity similar to younger children. These findings indicate a different arousal level in children with ADHD, which could be due to a delay in functional cortical maturation. · In Study V, impulsivity, brain processing and possible immaturity were studied. The same children with ADHD and controls as in study IV performed the Delay Task of GDS during registration of QEEG. In similarity to the results of study IV children with ADHD displayed different electrophysiological reactions, which may indicate that they, like younger children, have problems in cerebral processing when performing a mentally demanding task during a restricted time. · In Study VI, the "maturational lag" concept explaining ADHD was discussed over viewing previous and current literature on ADHD. The overview indicates that the DSM criteria of ADHD may be over- inclusive and shows that maturity and developmental aspects are important factors to be included in studies of ADHD. A slow speed in mental development may be of importance for the treatment and prognosis of ADHD. Conclusion. The over all results support the view, that some children with ADHD could represent a continuum of normal childhood behavior with maturational trajectories that are lagging behind and may catch up...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{a two-part}} longitudinal inquiry of complex systems thinking {{as a means}} of facilitating conceptual change. Study 1 employed a "posttest only control group" random assignment experimental design. Changes in ontological frameworks were assessed using an ontological coding taxonomy (OMMT) adopted from two sources (Ferrari & Chi, 1998; and, Jacobson, 2000) and refined for this study. The hypothesis was that first year Cegep science students receiving a complex systems intervention using StarLogoT would employ more emergent causal explanations and fewer clockwork explanations as a general explanatory framework for problem solving. By contrast, students in the control group would not. The 25 students in the experimental group generated significantly more emergent framework explanations on both near and moderate far transfer questions than did the 20 students in the control group. Furthermore, they generated significantly fewer clockwork framework explanations on near transfer questions but not on moderate or far transfer questions than did the control students. Study 2 was a mixed method qualitative case study of nine students selected from the participants in Study 1 using a purposeful sampling procedure. Students' acquisition of an emergent causal framework was assessed using an ontological measure referred to as the Complex Systems Taxonomy (CST) adopted from Jacobson (2000) and refined for this research. The two central research questions were the following: (1) What aspects of students' ontological and epistemological beliefs facilitated or constrained their acquisition of an emergent causal framework? (2) What experiences with StarLogoT facilitated or constrained this learning process? The findings were as follows: (1) Although students experienced gains in four of the six component features of emergent causal processes, their difficulty with the concepts of "random actions" of agents and "nonlinear effects" of agents constrained their deeper understanding of emergent causal processes. (2) Although StarLogoT facilitated the acquisition of certain aspects of this knowledge, it provided no affordance for learning the concept of "non linearity". Furthermore, aspects of these multi-agents representations generated conflicting ontological explanations for the concept of "randomness". (3) Although the selected StarLogoT simulations demonstrated emergent causal processes, they represented different types of complex systems (i. e., tightly coupled and dissipative loosely coupled). Although most students had difficulty with the representations of dissipative systems, those who had a more advanced understanding of science concepts gained an understanding of emergent causal processes from dissipative representations. (4) Conceptual change required metacognitive scaffolding and ongoing metaconceptual prompts during the instructional phase. However, once students acquired synthetic <b>mental</b> models, <b>maturation</b> over time and experience with complementary domain curricula was sufficient for them to elaborate their understanding of emergent causal processes...|$|R
40|$|The infant {{swimming}} {{stands for}} harmonic {{movement of the}} infant in the water caused by effective moves which keep the swimmer afloat. However, it {{does not lead to}} mastering the basic swimming skills. During infancy, the rapid <b>mental</b> development, <b>maturation</b> of central nervous system and physical growth take place. The infants meet the diseases for the first time. These can be the infectious, respiratory, eye, skin, ear diseases, urinary tract and the digestive system diseases. Also the allergy can turn up. The infant swimming positively influences the infants, but more and more objections are stated in connection with area of risks that can cause negative impact on infant?s health. Some of the paediatricians do not recommend the infant swimming at all. The aim of this bachelor?s thesis is to explore morbidity of infants who participate in infant swimming courses. For the empirical part, the quantitative research, using questionnaires and secondary analysis data from medical records given by a general practitioner for children and adolescents, was used. The research group were children who took part in infant swimming courses. The research with questionnaire was conducted on the grounds of swimming pool of the city Jindřichův Hradec. The electronic form of the questionnaire, thanks to which the parents from the other parts of the Czech Republic were addressed, was used to enhance the research group. The survey attended 141 parents in total. The medical records contained information about 62 children who took part in infant swimming and 22 children who did not. The data are collected on children who attended the infant swimming courses a year ago. Two research questions were defined. The first defined research question: ?Is there a relationship between the stay in swimming pool and the occurrence of diseases of infants?? The source for the answer for this research question was a conducted survey. The result of this survey is that the continuity of diseases of children who attend infant swimming courses was confirmed in 5 % of cases, from which the disease did not occurred again in three cases where the swimming pool was changed for other. The most current diseases were the fever, virus infection, respiratory diseases, atopic eczema and mollusci. The second defined research question: ?Is there a relationship between a regular stay in the swimming pool and repeated occurrence of respiratory diseases and skin diseases?? For this research question, the two hypotheses were established for the statistical evaluation. Hypothesis 1 : ?The infants who regularly attend the infant swimming courses do suffer a repeated occurrence of respiratory diseases in contrary to the infants who do not attend infant swimming courses. ? and hypothesis 2 : ?The infants who regularly attend the infant swimming courses do suffer a repeated skin diseases in contrary to the infants who do not attend infant swimming courses. ? The results of the medical records of infants which included a comparison of infants attending the infant swimming courses with non-swimmers shows that regular stay in the swimming pool does not increase the risk of repeated respiratory diseases and skin diseases. Concluding from the above results, the infant swimming has no negative impact on the health of infant in case of following further conditions, for example the individual assessment of the health status of the infant, discussion of the health status of the infant with the family general practitioner and compliance the half an hour acclimatization after the infant swimming courses before entering the external environment. The results can help for the development of preventive measures before the onset of diseases associated with the infant swimming courses, help to the trainers of infant swimming and also to the doctors when deciding on the recommendations of these courses...|$|R
40|$|Proefskrif (DMus) [...] PU vir CHOMOTIVATION FOR THE INVESTIGATION: A {{real need}} exists within Departments of Education, {{schools and other}} {{training}} centres for suitable objective measuring devices for selection, placement and diagnosis regarding the musical aptitude of pupils and students. The sooner special aptitude in a child is discovered and opportunities for further development are given, the better the chances for future success, achievement and self-realisation. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken {{with the purpose of}} investigating and defining more exactly, {{on the basis of a}} review of the literature available on the one hand and the practical application of a number of standardised tests on the other, the essence of musical aptitude. It was also attempted to determine the possible relation between musical aptitude and variables such as the spoken language, sex, age, interests and preferences as well as the influence of musical experiences and training. METHOD: In the first place an extensive review of the literature available was undertaken, numerous descriptions and definitions of aptitude in general and musical aptitude in particular were analysed and the most important elements extracted. On the basis of this procedure a synoptic definition was formulated. Secondly, the measurement of musical aptitude was investigated, the technical requirements and criteria which aptitude measurement must comply with were analysed and a large number of existing musical aptitude tests were reviewed and analysed into components. The purpose was to determine deductively from this the essential characteristics required of a musical aptitude test. In the third place an empirical investigation in three stages was conducted. During the preparatory stage the "Measures of Musical Abilities" test by Bentley was used and a number of experiments were carried out with groups of scholars and students to investigate the area of musical aptitude measurement especially with regards to test reliability and validity. A preliminary investigation with a large number of pupils from 50 primary and 20 secondary schools followed and various statistical techniques were applied to the acquired test data. The Bentley test was once more applied and put to the test under a wide variety of conditions. For the main investigation a stratified sample of 4379 pupils was used as well as a control group of 188 scholars who were at the time engaged in specialised musical training. In addition to the Bentley test Colwell's "Musical Achievement Tests" I and Gaston's "Test of Musicality" was applied, as well as an interest and preference test compiled by the author. The sound tracks of these tests were adapted so that both English and Afrikaans speaking pupils could be accommodated. The statistical operations performed included calculation of correlation coefficient, item analysis and the determining of norms as well as factor analysis. MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: •	Musical aptitude must be regarded as a theoretical construct which explains specific behavioural patterns as reflected in test results. It can further: more be described as the potential ability for musical development, including apprehension, skill and achievement or performance ability. The essence of musical aptitude finds its most distinctive evidence in the conceptual framework of rhythmic, melodic, harmonic and formal relationships which develop through a progressive organisation of musical perceptions •	The measurement and evaluation of musical aptitude should include both the perceptual as well as the interpretative aspects. The first include not only mere audio-acoustical perception but especially the judicious-musical perceptual aspect -cognitive operational thought as regards the organisation of sound structures and co-ordination between relationships. Extra-musical factors such as interest, home stimulation, socio-economic background, musical experience and training obviously play an important role in the manifestation of musical aptitude and must be taken into account in evaluation. •	The direct relationship between inherited factors and musical aptitude cannot be determined exactly. The speed with which musical tasks can be performed and the individual's eventual level of achievement are probably to some extent dependent on genetic determinants. On the other hand, characteristics acquired by general environmental influences and direct training play an important part. It follows that elements of musical aptitude such as pitch discrimination, rhythmical and tonal memory do not, consequently, represent constant, unchangeable data but are dependent on the influence of musical experience, general <b>mental</b> <b>maturation</b> and the educative process. Interest and motivation are furthermore important factors that will determine if the child's potential aptitude will be fully realised. •	From the results of the investigation it follows that sex, socio-economic level and musical preferences are variables significantly affecting test scores. Girls do better in the tests than boys and the socio-economic status and general preferences and taste are clearly reflected in the pupil's test scores. In addition, general intellectual ability and musical background are important for the full development of a child's musical aptitude. Home language and demographic differences between pupils represent factors probably playing a less significant role. •	The factors identified by factor analysis can be described as follows: Factor I: a general factor which includes mainly tonal memory and sensory discrimination; Factor II: judicial-musical perceptions as regards tonal-rhythmical elements; Factor III: an aesthetical-discriminative factor which includes general tonal sensitivity; Factor IV: a tonal relationship factor where/with recognition of complex musical relations are enclosed. •	On the grounds of extensive statistical analysis executed to determine the general significance and successful functioning of the Bentley, Colwell and Gaston tests the conclusion can be drawn that these tests, with certain reservations, satisfy the essential criteria of reliability, validity and general usefulness. The author's test reveals considerable shortcomings, although it serves a useful purpose in the judgement of taste, preference and interest. From a comparison of the mean test scores of the experimental group and the control group it can be concluded that the tests clearly discriminate between average pupils and those possessing exceptional musical aptitude. ESSENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS: It is recommended that further research be undertaken with the tests in the research programme, especially with regards to the reliability, validity and general discriminative value of the tests. A longitudinal investigation may further elucidate and confirm the diagnostic significance of the tests, or show up the limitations more clearly. The compilation and standardisation of a South African test of musical aptitude must be considered, taking into account on the one hand the adaptability of existing tests developed overseas, and on the other, the merits and deficiencies of the Wegelin &Wolmarans tests made available by the HSRC.
