40|$|A 16 -year-old boy {{allergic}} to penicillin complained {{of a right}} severe otalgia following 6 days of strepto-coccal pharyngitis. Physical exam showed multiple purplish black bullas on the right tympanic membrane (TM) like a blackberry, representing blood clots in the TM thick-ness (Figure 1). The diagnosis of hemorrhagic <b>myringitis</b> was made, and an azithromycin course was started. The hemorrhagic <b>myringitis</b> was completely healed 15 days after ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone ear drops (Figure 2). This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Board of Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center. Discussion There are 2 types of acute myringitis: bullous <b>myringitis</b> and bullous hemorrhagic <b>myringitis.</b> 1 Bullous <b>myringitis</b> is defined by the presence of blisters on the TM. Hemorrhagic <b>myringitis</b> is a distinctive form of otitis externa characterized by fluid-filled hemorrhagic blebs on the TM and skin of the deep exter-nal meatus. 1 They result from extravasation of blood between the outer and middle layers. Severe otalgia is usually the first symptom of presentation and may be followed by a sponta-neous appearance of blood-tinged serous or serosanguinous discharge. A temporary conductive hearing loss may occur. Definite etiology of acute <b>myringitis</b> is unknown. Acute bullous and hemorrhagic <b>myringitis</b> can be the consequenc...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionBullous <b>myringitis</b> {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of blisters on the tympanic membrane which has generally a severe otalgia as a first symptom of presentation. This clinical picture sometimes may be accompanied by sensori-neural hearing loss. In this study, we aimed to share visual content of a patient with Bullous <b>myringitis</b> admitted to the emergency department. Case presentationA 24 -year-old male patient complained of a right severe pain in the right ear and hearing loss was admitted to the emergency department. On physical examination the right tympanic membrane was oedematous, hyperaemic and blisters were seen. The patient was referred to ENT department for evaluation of hearing loss. Bullous <b>myringitis</b> with sensori-neural hearing loss in the right ear was diagnosed. For treatment, pain control and warm compression was recommended. Antibiotic therapy has been also planned for middle ear infection. ENT follow-up were planned for the assessment of hearing loss. Results and discussionMany microorganisms, especially viruses, m. pneumoniae, chlamydia may cause Bullous <b>myringitis.</b> In the literature bullous <b>myringitis</b> cases that admitted to ED with sensori-neural hearing loss have been reported. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination. Pain control and mild compression may be sufficient for treatment. If concomitant otitis media is present, antibiotics should be added to treatment...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the success rate}} and the surgical procedure of two different transcanal myringoplasty techniques using the Tutopatch(®) (Tutogen Medical, Inc., Alachua, FL, USA), a xenograft produced from bovine pericardium or the butterfly, an inlay tragal cartilage autograft. This is a retrospective study. We studied all cases of transcanal myringoplasty with Tutopatch and butterfly, performed by the same surgeon between April 2005 and May 2013. Perforations were secondary to chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, perforation post ventilation tube or trauma. They were not exceeding one-third of the tympanic membrane surface for the Tutopatch and one quarter for the butterfly. We evaluated the anatomical success rate, complications and postoperative hearing results in both techniques. A total of 106 myringoplasties were performed: 66 with Tutopatch and 40 with butterfly with a mean follow-up of 16. 5 and 5. 2  months, respectively. Successful closure rates of Tutopatch and butterfly were 75. 8  % (P <  0. 0001) and 85. 0  % (P <  0. 0001), respectively. <b>Myringitis</b> controlled with topical antibiotics treatment occurred in 8 (12. 1  %) and 5 (12. 5  %) cases. Eighty percent of patients with Tutopatch had a mean residual air-bone gap within 10  dB, compared to 85. 0  % in patients with butterfly. When anatomically feasible, a transcanal approach myringoplasty with a Tutopatch(®) graft or butterfly appears to provide good anatomical and functional results. We show that both techniques provide good anatomical and functional results. The butterfly has the advantage to use an autograft, which is surgically easier {{because it does not}} require tympanomeatal flap elevation. We recommend the butterfly technique for non-marginal perforation not exceeding one quarter of the tympanic membrane after excision of the perforation edge and Tutopatch for bigger perforation or when standard autografts are not available. <b>Myringitis</b> is the only described complication without specific incidence...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is common}} in {{clinical}} practice to administer systemic steroids to treat sensorineural hearing loss due to bullous <b>myringitis</b> (BM). Nonetheless, there is currently no definitive evidence that steroid therapy is effective and appropriate for BM. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of systemic steroid therapy for treating BM. Patients and methods: This prospective study included 23 patients affected by BM with sensorineural hearing loss (median age, 45. 8 years). The subjects were divided into two groups: Group A received only systemic antibiotic treatment and Group B received systemic antibiotics plus systemic steroid treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the groups in terms of the sensorineural hearing loss recovery. Both treatments were effective, suggesting that administration of oral steroids in combination with antibiotics did not confer an advantage in terms of sensorineural hearing loss recovery rate in the tested population...|$|E
40|$|Acquired {{external}} auditory canal atresia is a rare complication of chronic inflammatory otitis, and is generally fibrous or soft tissue in nature. Here, we present the first reported case of heterotopic ossification within chronic fibrosing otitis externa in a 25 -year-old male patient with a childhood history of granular <b>myringitis</b> and failed tympanoplasty. A calcified mass was demonstrated adjacent to the tympanic membrane on CT imaging, and surgical exploration revealed a cohesive bar of bone traversing themedial {{external auditory}} canal. Drill canaloplasty and split-thickness skin graft coverage of the lateral tympanic membrane resulted in an improvement in the pure tone average from 79 to 55 dB. As the treatment for chronic fibrosing otitis externa involves the surgical widening of the {{external auditory canal}}, we alert surgeons {{to the possibility of}} cohesive bone formation as a potential cause of navigational confusion and inadvertent over- or under-drilling of the canal stenosis...|$|E

40|$|Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{has been}} {{associated}} with respiratory tract infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia–related pleural effusion is rarely reported. Extra-pulmonary abnormalities such as encephalitis, myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and <b>myringitis</b> have been reported. However pulmonary manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus include pneumonitis, pleurisy, interstitial lung disease, and thromboembolic disease. We present the case of a 26 -year-old male who came for evaluation of fever, cough, and shortness of breath with right-sided chest pain. He was found to have right-side loculated complicated parapneumonic effusion and underwent drainage with a pleural catheter followed by fibrinolytic therapy. He was then found to have new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus concomitant with Mycoplasma pneumonia, leading to lupus flare and lupus nephritis. He responded well to levofloxacin, steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and mycophenolate, with complete resolution of loculated pleural effusion and symptom improvement. Our case describes the rare combination of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, parapneumonic pleural effusion, and lupus flare with lupus nephritis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an episodic disease {{most likely}} of {{autoimmune}} etiology, characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous structures. METHODS: Retrospective case study at two tertiary referral centers with presentation of nine patients with otologic involvement of RP, {{review of the}} spectrum of otologic disorders seen, and treatment. RESULTS: The clinical course of otologic manifestations of RP was highly variable and ranged from mild to moderate. In 6 / 9 patients there was an association with other autoimmune disorders. In addition to recurrent auricular chondritis, which was present in 8 / 9 patients, our patients had otitis externa, chronic <b>myringitis,</b> Eustachian tube dysfunction, conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus. All patients had their diagnosis of RP {{made on the basis}} of their otologic involvement and the response to systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of RP is primarily clinical, but laboratory studies and biopsy may contribute as well. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the otolaryngologist should consider consultation with a rheumatologist to assist in the management of additional systemic manifestations...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{describes}} the technique and the preliminary results of transcanal myringoplasty for small or midsized tympanic membrane perforations with the Tutopatch (Tutogen Medical, Inc., Alachua, FL, USA), a xenograft derived from bovine pericardium. METHODS: All procedures started with a Rosen incision. The meatal skin was loosened from the bone up to the fibrous annulus, which was dislocated out of the sulcus, and the tympanic membrane was elevated from the malleus handle. The Tutopatch was placed over the malleus handle, the annulus, and the denuded bone. RESULTS: Eleven patients were included, and follow-up ranged from 3 to 14 months. Ten of the eleven eardrums were successfully closed. One patient developed <b>myringitis</b> 2 months after the procedure. The average air-bone gap at 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, of all but one patient was less than 10 dB. CONCLUSION: When anatomically feasible, a transcanal myringoplasty with a Tutopatch graft yields similar audiological results compared to fascia temporalis, perichondrium or tragal perichondrium-cartilage, but reduces the surgical trauma, the complications of the autograft harvesting, and the negative cosmetic and psychological impact of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|M. pneumoniae is {{a common}} cause of respi-ratory tract infection. Clinical manifestations in-clude pharyngitis, bullous <b>myringitis,</b> tracheo-bronchitis or pneumonitis.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the long-term results 3 years after primary myringoplasties performed with formolized fascia temporalis autografts. The overall closure rate was 87. 7 % of cases, with improvement in hearing in 67. 2 % of cases. The best results were achieved with total perforations, {{and not with}} partial posterior perforations, contrary to popular opinion. The anterior perforations were {{the most difficult to}} close. Anterior angle blunting was avoided by careful technique. Although the results of myringoplasty are clearly better in adults than in children, there is not a determined "frontier age" before which a child may not undergo operation. The state of the middle ear at the time of operation influences surgical outcome: wet ears have a higher rate of perforation, <b>myringitis,</b> and retraction pocket. Medical treatment is recommended prior to surgery in every discharging ear, as a diagnostic method rather than a therapeutic one. If the ear remains wet, chronic otitis media should be considered rather than simple perforation of the eardrum, and a mastoidectomy should be combined with the myringoplasty...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Otitis {{media is}} a complex and multifactorial {{condition}} with four defined stages: <b>myringitis,</b> acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation {{has been associated with}} the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. In acute otitis media the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic otitis media these organisms, plus Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromized and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of mycoplasmas {{for members}} of the animal kingdom has been recognized for many years (1 - 3), and isolated reports (4 - 7) have indicated that the pleuropneumonialike organisms (PPLO's) may also be pathogenic for man. Recent knowledge that the Eaton agent, a PPLO, is a cause of atypical pneumonia (8) and that <b>myringitis</b> can be caused by mycoplasma (9) has greatly stimulated the interest of medical investigators in these infectious agents. It is now considered likely that this order of microorganisms may also play a role in other human diseases of as yet unknown etiology, particularly where clinical manifestations resemble known PPLO infections in animals. In addition, mycoplasmas have been found associated with two human tumors (10 - 16) though the connection of this microbe with neoplasia is still entirely in the realm of speculation. Studies have been hampered by the fastidious growth requirements of the microorganism in vitro, and the difficulty of its detection in the infected host. Though the initial isolation of many PPLO's has been achieved in mammalian cell cultures, the organism is able to proliferate in a variety of cell-free media, and the relationship to the host cell has remained obscure. It is well known that the presence of mycoplasmas is detrimental to tissue cultures, but it is still controversial whether actual cell penetration is responsible for this cytopathogenic effect (13, 14) or whether depletion of essential nutrients alone, or in combination with a cytotoxin (15 - 17), leads to the destruction of infected cultures. Similarly, the underlying histopathogenicity of the lesions in experimentally infected animals is not yet understood, though it has become possible to delineate mycoplasma colonies with the fluorescence antibody technique (18) ...|$|E
