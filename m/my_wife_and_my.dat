I don't owe this administration. They owe <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor. Bush's action ... demonstrates that the White House is corrupt from top to bottom." [...] He reiterated this perspective on the commutation in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on July 11, 2007, vehemently protesting that a Republican congressman was engaging in [...] "yet a further smear of my wife's good name and my good name." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg's {{brother and}} key {{prosecution}} witness, recanted his testimony about his sister having typed the notes. In 2001 he stated, [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] He said he gave false testimony {{to protect himself}} and his wife, Ruth, {{and that he was}} encouraged by the prosecution to do so; [...] "My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] He refused to express any remorse for his decision to betray his sister, saying only that he did not realize that the death penalty would be invoked. He stated, [...] "I would not sacrifice <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> children for my sister." [...] In September 2008, hundreds of pages of grand jury transcripts were released. With this release, it was revealed that Ruth Greenglass had irreconcilable differences between her grand jury testimony of August 1950 and the testimony she gave at trial. At the grand jury, Ruth Greenglass was asked, [...] "Didn't you write [...] down {{on a piece of paper}}?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, I wrote [...] down on a piece of paper and [...] took it with him." [...] But at the trial, she testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed up notes about the atomic bomb.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{assassination}} of Henry IV gave full rein to the Ultramontane party at court, Duperron became more importunate, even menacing. Casaubon began {{to pay attention to}} overtures from the bishops and the court of England. In October 1610 he came to England in the suite of the ambassador, Lord Wotton of Marley (brother of Casaubon's early friend Henry Wotton), an official invitation having been sent him by Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had the most flattering reception from King James I, who often sent for him to discuss theological matters. The English bishops were delighted to find that the great French scholar was a ready-made Anglican, who had arrived, by independent study of the Fathers, at the very via media (middle way) between Puritanism and Catholicism which was becoming the fashion in the English Church. Casaubon, though a layman, was collated to a prebendal stall in Canterbury, and a pension of £300 a year was assigned him from the exchequer. King James insisted that [...] "I will have Mr Casaubon paid before me, <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> barnes." [...] Casaubon still retained his appointments in France, and his office as librarian: he had obtained leave of absence for the visit to England, where he was not supposed to settle permanently. In order to retain their hold on him, the queen regent, Marie de Medici refused to allow his library to be sent over. It required a specific request from James himself to allow Madame Casaubon to bring him a part of his most necessary books. Casaubon continued to speak of himself as the servant of the regent, and to declare his readiness to return when summoned to do so.|$|E

40|$|We are new parents. We {{sleep in}} {{sporadic}} chunks. We eat, write, clean, and do laundry with one hand. This paper {{is my first}} foray into writing since the birth of <b>my</b> son <b>and</b> the content is also partially about him. It was written while taking turns comforting, feeding, and changing diapers. For this paper, I will call my son, Sam. Despite the indulgence and gushing of new parents, the change that he brought to <b>my</b> <b>wife’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> life was substantive. In this paper, I describe one small change that occurred because of Sam’s entry into our world in order to introduce concepts of complexity theory <b>and</b> transformation. I outline <b>my</b> <b>wife’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> choice in naming Sam and the changes and resistances we witnessed within my family (resulting from our name choice) {{as a basis for}} an introduction to complexity theory language. Expanding on the concepts of transformation and change, this paper then explores some data from my PhD dissertation, in which I looked at complexity theory as a tool to describe human connection to place and learning. I use examples taken from my interviews to examine the ways in which returning to childhood and adolescent (trans) formative places demonstrates the elements of panarchy theory as a tool to describe change within social systems.
