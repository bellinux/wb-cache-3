However, {{the efficiency of}} the methodology is not fully quantitatively understood. This study aims for the identification of the sources of error in the VPD-DC-TXRF process. From a study of systematic recovery rate (RR) on standard wafers, it is concluded that the VPD-DC method is very efficient in collecting impurities front Si wafers. TXRF saturation effect on the micro-droplet residue limits the accuracy of quantification to the levels below 3 X 10 (13) atoms of <b>metallic</b> <b>contamination.</b> This represents a homogenous single element surface contamination of 1 x 10 (11) at/cm(2) on a 200 -mm wafer.

These {{samples were}} {{mounted on a}} water-cooled substrate holder in a high vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10 - 6 mbar, which can be tilted from 0 ° (corresponding to normal ion incidence) up to 90 ° {{with respect to the}} axis of the ion beam source. The cooling ensures a substrate temperature below 80 °C. Furthermore, the sample holder is equipped with a silicon shielding in order to prevent <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminations</b> that affect the evolving structures on Si [14, 25] as well as on Ge [24, 26]. This non co-deposition setup also prevents secondary collisions of scattered gas ions and redeposition of sputtered silicon atoms [27]. For the experiments, a homebuilt Kaufman-type ion source is used. Furthermore, the source is equipped with two 190 -mm grids with a reduced aperture of 100 mm. Hence, no <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminations</b> could be detected with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) as well as with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The Xe + ion current density was kept constant at 300 μ A/cm 2 during the experiments which results in an ion flux of J = 1.87 × 1015 cm- 2 s- 1 in a plane perpendicular to the ion beam. The samples were irradiated for durations from 1 up to 120 min corresponding to a fluence range from 1.12 × 1017 cm- 2 to 1.35 × 1019 cm- 2. An ion energy of 600 and 1, 200 eV was used. The surface topography was analyzed by scanning atomic force microscopy (AFM) operating in TappingMode™ or ScanAsyst™ mode [28]. The measurements were performed in air using silicon nitride cantilever with Si tips with a nominal tip radius smaller than 5 nm (TappingMode™; Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) or silicon nitride cantilevers with nominal tip radius of 2 nm (ScanAsyst™; Bruker Corporation). Routinely, each sample was analyzed with a scan size of 2 or 4 μ m and 10 μ m and a resolution of at least 1, 024 × 1, 024 pixels. The AFM data were analyzed with SPIP™ [29] software and a custom-programmed MATLAB®; (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) routine for calculation of the power spectral density (PSD) functions following an approach of Duparré et al. [30]. The wavelengths of the ripple structures are determined from the corresponding PSD curve. For a given sample (sample size typically 10 mm × 10 mm), the wavelength determined at different positions across the sample is extremely small. Also, the fluctuation of the corresponding RMS surface roughness is negligible small. Therefore, no error bars are indicated in the graphs as they are typically smaller than the symbol size. However, {{it must be noted that}} the experimental reproducibility between different etching series is in the range ≤ 5 %. For surface gradient angle calculation, SPIP™ was used again and the gradient angles are calculated in ion beam projection direction. The gradient histograms have been computed from the x-gradient images.|$|R

The study was designed {{as an attempt to}} link biofilm metal tolerance and <b>metallic</b> <b>contamination</b> in a field survey covering 13 different sampling sites in the Seine river basin (north of France) with low contamination levels. Cd and Zn tolerance of heterotrophic communities was assessed using a short-term toxicity test based on β-glucosidase activity.

Indeed, <b>metallic</b> <b>contamination</b> at the sampling sites remained subtle when compared to water quality standards (only two sampling sites had either Zn or both Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding the Environmental Quality Standards set by the EU Water Framework Directive). Yet, multivariate analysis of the data using Partial Least Squares Regression revealed that both metallic and environmental parameters were important variables explaining the variability of metal tolerance levels. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) was also performed on both bacterial and eukaryotic biofilm communities from the 13 sampling sites. Multivariate analysis of ARISA fingerprints revealed that biofilms with similar tolerance levels have similar ARISA profiles.

The relationship between copper concentration on the wafer surface and hydrofluoric acid concentration was determined.
