40|$|Non-cognitive factors (such as {{personality}} and self-evaluations) might play {{important roles in}} explaining domain-specific school achievement. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether Big Five personality factors (conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion and neuroticism) were associated with <b>math</b> achievement <b>and</b> to see if there was a mediating role of <b>math</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>math</b> self-efficacy in this relation. In a sample of 1014 Dutch ninth grade schoolchildren, the Big Five of personality, as well as <b>math</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>math</b> self-efficacy were assessed as predictors of math achievement. Online questionnaires were used to assess schoolchildren’s <b>math</b> performance <b>and</b> their personality, <b>math</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>math</b> self-efficacy. For the Big Five personality factors separately, openness to experience and agreeableness were weak predictors of math achievement. <b>Math</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>math</b> self-efficacy mediated the association between openness to experience <b>and</b> <b>math</b> achievement. Math self-concept mediated the association between agreeableness <b>and</b> <b>math</b> achievement. Math self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of math achievement.
