40|$|An immunocytochemical {{approach}} {{was used to}} localize myosin with respect to individual fibers in rat skeletal muscle. Transverse cryostat sections of rat diaphragm, a fast-twitch muscle, were exposed to fluorescein-labeled immunoglobulin against purified chicken pectoralis myosin. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a differential response among fiber types, identified {{on the basis of}} mitochondrial content. All white and intermediate fiber but only about half of the red fiber reacted with his antimyosin. In addition, an alkali-stable ATPase had the same pattern of distribution among fibers, which is consistent with the existence of two categories of red fibers. The positive response of certain red fibers indicates either that their myosin has antigenic determinants in common with "white" myosin, or that the immunogen contained a "red" myosin. Myosin, extracted from a small region of the pectorlis which consists entirely of white fibers, was used to prepare an immunoadsorbent column to isolate antibodies specific for white myosin. This purified anti-white myosin reacted with the same fibers of the rat diaphragm that had reacted with the white, intermediate, and some red fibers are sufficiently homologous to share antigenic determinants. In a slow-twitch muscle, the soleus, only a minority of the fiber reacted with antipectoralis myosin. The majority failed to respond; hence, they are not equivalent to intermediate fibers of the diaphragm; despite their intermediate mitochondrial content. Immunocytochemical analysis of two different <b>musles</b> of the rat has demonstrated that more than one isoenzyme of myosin can exist in a single muscle, and that individual fiber types can be recognized by immunological differences in their myosin. We conclude that, in the rat diaphragm, {{there are at least two}} immunochemically distinct types of myosin and four types of muscle fibers: white, intermediate, and two red.

40|$|Endurance {{exercise}} is commonly known to improve skeletal muscle performance {{with respect to}} fatigue resistance. The exact mechanisms, however, as to how skeletal muscle adapts to increased physical demand are still largely unknown, despite extensive research. These processes were originally studied in laboratory animals employing classic cross-innervation and chronic motor nerve stimulation experiments. In time, treadmill and running wheel exercise modalities became more popular due {{to their ability to}} study adaptation processes in a minimally invasive, in vivo, situation. In this respect, mouse skeletal muscle adaptations have been extensively investigated, mainly due to the increasing availability of transgenic animals. In order to extrapolate adaptations in transgenic mice to a human situation, however, it is essential to understand these processes in normal, wild-type mice. In the present thesis we have investigated the effects of six weeks endurance exercise on mouse skeletal muscle functioning, and associated metabolic and genomic changes. On of our first objective was to characterize the running pattern of voluntarily exercising mice. This clearly demonstrated an intermittent running pattern consisting of short bouts of high-speed running. This roughly compares to high-speed interval training in human, although there clearly are differences between these two. We further demonstrated that endurance exercise obviously improves fatigue resistance in both the slow-twitch soleus and the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, but that mouse skeletal muscle is remarkably robust in its myosin heavy chain (MyHC) phenotype. Studies in humans typically show changes in MyHC profile, the contractile proteins of skeletal muscle. Soleus <b>musles</b> further demonstrated improved capacity to relax during serial twitch contractions. This suggests improved Ca 2 + recovery and was associated with changes in mRNA and protein expression of Ca 2 + regulatory proteins. Further, exercised soleus muscle consumed more oxygen during these serial contraction, which was associated with changes in mRNA expression of genes related to oxygen/glucose metabolism. In EDL, no such changes were found, neither at the functional level, nor at the protein and genomic level. In contrast, this muscle typically demonstrated changes in genes associated with cell cycle regulation, without changes in EDL size of phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate different adaptation processes between the slow-twitch soleus and the fast-twitch EDL muscle, although both demonstrate changes mainly at the regulatory level...|$|R

Water erosion is a major cause of watershed degradation. Empirical erosion models are often used to estimate the soil erosion and sediment yield. Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) predicts the annual average soil erosion. Modified universal soil loss equation (<b>MUSLE)</b> predicts sediment yield on a storm event base. The land attributes such as topographic features, soil types, vegetation covers and climatic factors have direct effects on soil loss. Slope gradient and slope length are two most important topographic features that affect soil loss. Classifying slope gradient with different criteria may lead to different model predictions. This thesis studied how the predictions of models (RUSLE and <b>MUSLE)</b> vary when different criteria are used to classified the slope gradients. Decomposing a watershed into a set of hydrological response units (HRU) can provide a better consideration of spatial variability of the soil erosion processes. HRU were used as analysis windows in previous watershed erosion studies. HRU were used as the experiment units in this study. Soil erosions were predicted based on each HRU. RUSLE and <b>MUSLE</b> models were integrated with a geographic information system (GIS). Slope was classified using three different schemes and inputted into GIS to decompose watershed into hydrologic response units. Model predictions were made for each classification scheme.

Procedures to develop hydrologic response units, model input parameters and integrate soil loss equations with GIS are also developed to offer users a complete tool set.

40|$|Sedimentation {{surveys of}} small dams {{demonstrate}} that land use {{is the dominant}} factor generating high sediment yields in the ungullied shale catchments of western Sydney where rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility are relatively constant. A single urban catchment produced 6. 5 t/ha. year and cropped catchments an average of 6. 7 ᠱ. 99 t/ha. year, whereas grazed woodland/forest and grazed pasture exported averages of only 2. 5 ᠰ. 57 and 2. 9 ᠱ. 02 t/ha. year, respectively. These yields are high by Australian standards and the farm dam sediments are enriched in both clay and phosphorus, in comparison to catchment topsoils. Empirical soil loss equations based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) [Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (<b>MUSLE),</b> Soiloss and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) ] accurately predicted the measured sediment yields, with Soiloss being the most accurate. Although Soiloss is the only empirical equation to use Australian data, it is only marginally better than <b>MUSLE,</b> a simplified version of the USLE used for teaching. RUSLE predictions of soil loss rates were closely correlated with measured sediment yields but required inputs for poorly defined parameters. European land uses in the South Creek catchment, the largest shale catchment in western Sydney, have probably increased mean annual sediment yield by 4. 4 times over that in 1788. Further increases are likely with increasing urbanisation. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{in to the}} {{sediment}} delivery of watersheds and its variation is {{an important element of}} ecosystem management. Since sediment load depends on runoff quantity, and runoff is considered as a unique indicator of sediment load, in this research the two modified versions of the <b>MUSLE</b> model were evaluated for 9 torrential events in two subwatersheds of the Kamal Saleh watershed in the Markazi Province of Iran. To this end, first all factors of the model including runoff, erodibility, topographic, cover management, and support practice were estimated using routine equations of the model. Then, the power coefficient in the runoff factor was corrected, applying two methods: “m correction coefficient” and “average correction coefficient. The evaluation criteria showed that the “m correction coefficient method” (compared to the “average correction coefficient method”) reduces the difference of the observed and estimated sediment load of small and large torrential events remarkably. In fact, the application of this modified method increased the accuracy of the <b>MUSLE</b> by decreasing the standard deviation of prediction. Also, the validation analysis of the modified method showed that the coefficient of efficiency indexes for the Hasan-Abad station (Rudkhane Bozorg subwatershed) and Ghal'e-No station (Ashur-abad subwateshed) were 0. 997 and 0. 811, respectively. This result confirms the efficiency of application of “m correction coefficient method”. However, it is suggested that the performance of this method be evaluated using a sufficient number of individual hydrographs and their sedimentgraphs in other watersheds...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} a combination of revisions to the cover and management factor (C), support practice factor (P), and topographic factor (LS), and to determine the best use of each combination for modified universal soil loss equation (<b>MUSLE)</b> being applied in the Loess Plateau of China. Eight combinations were built based on common local methods of revision to factors C, P, and LS in three ways (single factor revised, two factors revised, and three factors revised, respectively). By validating the effect of these combinations on sediment yield estimation using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and angle between liner trend line and 1 : 1 line, the optimal combination was selected. Results show that:(1) the original method significantly overestimates the sediment yield; (2) when revising a single factor, the LS factor revision has the greatest positive effect; (3) when revising two factors, the combination of a simultaneous revision to C and to P has the smallest angle between the liner trend line and the 1 : 1 line (1. 37 degrees); if the estimating accuracy of sediment peak is required, this combination may thus be a useful approach; and (4) when revising C, P, and LS simultaneously, the combination has the highest NSE (0. 76), lowest NRMSE (1. 19), and the highest correlation coefficient (0. 760), and may be used to estimate sediment yield. The suitability of <b>MUSLE</b> is enhanced using the common local revision to factors C, P, and LS. Under the assumption that level terrace spatial information can obtain effectively (or that there are few level terraces), these findings {{can be applied to the}} Loess Plateau for the design of soil and water conservation measures and for flood disaster assessment, and applied to future model applications in the Loess Plateau...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: A {{study in}} Malaysia {{had been carried}} out to predict the {{sediment}} accumulation in urban detention ponds. Suspended sediment is pollutant of primary concern to the river that results in adverse environmental effect. Detention pond becomes a practical approach to this problem. Suspended sediment that settled in stormwater detention pond, can bring effect to the detention pond functions. Questions were raised on how certain were the observed and predicted values of sediment depth and load accumulation estimations. Secondly the question was what the sediment accumulation be in the next 100 years. The uncertainties of sediments estimation vary greatly due to the hydrological variability and rainfall random nature obtain the relationship between flow discharge and suspended sediment rate using on-site data collection at UTM and Ledang Heights, Nusajaya. Predict accumulated sediment loads and depth from <b>MUSLE</b> over 10 - 100 years. Analyze the uncertainties of sediment loads and depth using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combining normal distribution. Obtain the maximum probability of occurrence of sediment loads and depth in the detention pond. Approach: Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (<b>MUSLE)</b> and Trap Efficiency (TE) Method was applied to predict sediment accumulation. This uncertainty of sediment loads and depth was carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) Method. The water samples were collected for suspended solids data and other water quality parameters at Ledang Heights, Nusajaya, Johor and University Technology Malaysia (UTM), Johor. Sampling station were randomly selected at the inlet and outlet of the detention pond. The hydrological parameters such as flow and velocity were also collected. Results: The simulation results showed the maximum probability of occurrence value for observed sediment loads and sediment depth from Ledang Heights were 0. 0062 tons (16. 5 %) and 0. 0005 mm (17. 5 %) respectively. The maximum probability of occurrence values for observed sediment loads and sediment depth at UTM showed no obvious differences with Ledang Heights; about 0. 015 tons (16. 8 %) and 0. 00037 mm (15. 5 %) respectively. The maximum occurrence of predicted sediment loads and sediment depth using <b>MUSLE</b> method for Ledang Height was 77. 8 tons (16. 8 %) and 7. 5 mm (26. 8 %) respectively. The maximum occurrence for UTM was slightly higher, about 264 tons (15. 70 %) and 7. 0 mm (21. 10 %) respectively. The higher values for UTM were suspected due to its larger watershed. The sediment loads and depths were also predicted for the next 50 - 100 years considering no significant watershed land use changes. Conclusion: The sediment accumulation estimation and forecasting {{are very important to}} ensure the effectiveness and proper operation of the detention pond. The continuous effort through natural sediment control measures such as proper vegetation and grass inplants are always encourage around the detention pond and surrounding areas throughout its lifespan...|$|E
