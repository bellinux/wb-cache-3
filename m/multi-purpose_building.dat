Finally, on September 11, 1950, Capuchino High School opened in San Bruno. After years of using Green Hall as a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building,</b> the city dedicated a library and city hall in 1954. That same year saw the dedication of the current central terminal at the airport, part of a major expansion program.

25|$|The first {{museum that}} was not {{supported}} and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, {{as well as a}} portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building,</b> following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (Künstlerhaus) now defines itself “as a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.” The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.|$|E

500|$|The congregations of {{some other}} former churches also officially joined other church communities. [...] When the Roman Catholic [...] of Our Lady Star of the Sea and St Denis in Portslade closed in 1992, the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton merged its parish with that of Southwick, a town in the {{neighbouring}} district of Adur. [...] St Theresa of Lisieux's Church, built in 1955 for Southwick's Roman Catholics, served both towns thereafter. [...] The closure in 1943 of Preston Park Methodist Church (demolished in 1974) led to its worshippers joining the Stanford Avenue Methodist Church {{on the other side}} of the park. [...] The merger in 1972 of the Congregational Church, the Presbyterian Church of England and several other denominations to form the United Reformed Church resulted in overcapacity in both Hove and Brighton. [...] At Hove, the former St Cuthbert's Congregational Church became redundant in the early 1980s when services were consolidated at the Cliftonville Congregational Church (later renamed Central United Reformed Church); and in Brighton, the Union Chapel on Air Street was sold to office developers to pay for a new <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building,</b> the Brighthelm Church and Community Centre, in the nearby grounds of Hanover Chapel. [...] This early 19th-century building had housed a Presbyterian community, the Queen's Road Presbyterian Church, since 1847; but it was dilapidated and, because of the Congregational–Presbyterian merger, surplus to requirements.|$|E
2500|$|The Grade II* listed Water Tower (or Bagnio as it {{was known}} at the time) {{was built in the}} early 18th century, {{primarily}} to house a water driven pump supplying water to Carshalton House (now St Philomena's School) and the fountains in its gardens.

2500|$|The {{need for}} space was {{resolved}} in 1849 with {{the removal of}} the collection to the <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building</b> by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse – simply named the [...] "Museum" [...] – {{on the site of the}} former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold Böcklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes – i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.|$|E

[...] The lawsuit accused the GLSHS of overdeveloping the Whitefish Point Light Station in violation of its federal land patent and the USFWS of not protecting the site. [...] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001 when the parties arrived at a settlement agreement that appointed a mediator to negotiate the Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for Whitefish Point to regulate land use and any development at Whitefish Point. [...] MAS acknowledged the museum's growth was not the sole cause of Whitefish Point's popularity that drew many visitors for sunbathing and ship watching. [...] GLSHS agreed there must be a limit to development at Whitefish Point although it still intended to build museum wings.|$|E

[...] When the plans were ratified in 1997, the structure and fabric of the building were found to be in unexpectedly poor condition.

[...] The project cost about £700,000 and was completed in 1999. [...] The church repurchased the former Young Women's Christian Institute building in the 1990s after it had passed out of their ownership; it was believed to be in such poor condition that a proposal was made to demolish it and replace it with a new <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building</b> to be used by the church and other groups. [...] It eventually turned out to be in better condition than previously thought and was instead just completely refurbished.|$|E
2500|$|Indiana's first {{basketball}} {{home was}} the original Assembly Hall, {{and at the time}} it was known simply as the Men's Gymnasium. As a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>building</b> it also hosted a number of other indoor sports and campus activities.

The first basketball game was played on February 21, 1901, when Indiana lost to Butler 24–20. In March 1911 the gym hosted the first ever Indiana high school basketball tournament and was hosted by the IU Booster Club instead of the IHSAA. As basketball began to outgrow the facility, students went so far as to characterize the gym as a public menace and health risk. On January 13, 1917, Indiana played its final game in the gym with a win over Iowa State 29–13. The building was torn down in 1938.|$|E
