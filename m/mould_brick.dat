5000|$|The ground floor, {{which was}} built of rusticated {{sandstone}} from Gatelawbridge, Scotland, featured two large, recessed Roman archways, one on each wing, which served as the main entrances.

50|$|The body of {{the church}} is {{constructed}} in flint, and the tower in brick. Its plan consists of a nave, a south porch, a chancel with a chapel to the north, and a west tower. The parapets of the nave and chancel are embattled, as is that of the tower which also has crocketted pinnacles at the corners. The porch has a <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> parapet.|$|R

Its geometric decorations are done with <b>moulded</b> <b>brick.</b> Along with the Granja de Torrehermosa and the surrounding Hornachos, Alange and Puebla de la Reina and others, the church {{is the most}} outstanding example of the achievements of the Mudéjar style in Lower Extremadura.|$|R
50|$|Andres Pedersen, a Danish {{soldier who}} took part in the Hundred Years' War, was denizenised in England in 1433, {{becoming}} Sir Andrew Ogard. In 1443 he was allowed to impark part of the manor of Rye, the area then called the Isle of Rye, in the parish of Stanstead Abbots, and was given licence to crenellate what became Rye House. Over 50 types of <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> were used in its construction.|$|R
50|$|The present {{building}} {{was built on}} the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the New Court Theatre. Designed by Walter Emden and Bertie Crewe, it is constructed of fine red <b>brick,</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>brick,</b> and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.|$|R
50|$|The <b>moulded</b> <b>bricks</b> {{were then}} loaded onto bogies for {{transfer}} to the autoclaves. Each of the six autoclaves could contain 13 bogies. Steam was then applied from the Lancashire boiler which provided saturated steam up to 160 lbs. per sq. inch. This process lasted 12 hours, following which the finished bricks would be taken on the works railway system either to storage sheds or to the railway goods depot.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme water goes to the scheme from the dam through a 5.8 km [...] gradient-driven open canal. Some villagers {{illegally}} take water from the canal to <b>mould</b> <b>bricks</b> and for the irrigation of small gardens along the canal. Some of this water overspills from these illegal gardens back into the Ngondoma River. This behaviour weakens water supply to the scheme yet water leaves the dam outlet full throttle.|$|R
50|$|Level Loop is a {{historic}} home and farm located near Brownsburg, Rockbridge County, Virginia. It was built about 1819, and is a two-story, five bay, brick Federal style dwelling. It has a side gable roof, exterior end chimneys, and a <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> cornice.

50|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} Hanworth is a single-storeyed, U-shaped, unpainted redbrick building, with characteristics demonstrating a Georgian influence. The principal elevation faces north {{with a broad}} verandah running around the northern, eastern and western perimeter of the building. The original building is only one room in depth. The hipped roof and separate verandah roof are sheeted with corrugated iron. At {{each end of the}} roof is a <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> chimney. It is substantially intact with most of its original glazing, joinery and hardware.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the neo-classical College Hall, training took place in old naval huts. In the 1920s Sir Samuel Hoare (later Lord Templewood) battled for a substantial College building. Architect's plans were drawn up in 1929 for the present-day College. After some disagreement between Hoare and architect James West, the building plans incorporated design aspects of Christopher Wren's Royal Hospital at Chelsea. In September 1933 the building was completed; it was built of rustic and <b>moulded</b> <b>brick.</b> Its frontage was 800 ft.|$|R
50|$|The new {{extension}} {{building was}} erected on stand 4508 in high quality materials - including black granite, marble, hardwood windows, bronze grilles, brown brick - and {{had its own}} vehicular access to the basement. The facade of seven bays with a rusticated base, was articulated by decorative key stones to the ground floor. The architects employed specially <b>moulded</b> <b>bricks</b> and deep stone surrounds to add shadow lines and visual interest to the facade. The building has six storeys (including the ground floor) and a basement.|$|R
50|$|TC Hine {{adopted a}} {{distinctly}} 'Anglo-Italian' style for the principal elevations. In places, this appears redolent of the 15th century Palazzo Ricardi in Florence, Italy. His chosen materials were plain <b>brick,</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> and local Derbyshire and Ancaster stone (often exchanged for rendering {{at high levels}} for economy). By giving a high priority to {{the appearance of the}} elevations, Hine had to adjust the level of some of the internal floors and allow some floors to cut across windows, so as not to spoil the overall intended effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of brick masonry {{are influenced by}} the properties of bricks and mortar. This paper attempts at studying the properties of brick masonry using table <b>moulded</b> <b>bricks</b> and wire-cut bricks of India with various types of mortars. The strength and elastic modulus of brick masonry under compression have been evaluated for strong-brick soft-mortar and soft-brick strong-mortar combinations. Various sizes of prisms and wallettes have been tested during these experiments to study the size effect and different bonding arrangements. The failure mechanisms of such specimens have been studied. Attempts are also made to derive empirical relationships for masonry strength as a function of brick and mortar strength in the Indian context...|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} from ashlar limestone with red-brick quoins on the buttresses and window edges. The steeply pitched roof is constructed from timber originally with jarrah shingles but most recently with terra cotta tiles. When originally built the church {{consisted of a}} nave and an aisle on the north western side; the vestry is at the north-eastern end of the aisle with a connecting tower and porch at the south-western end facing Norfolk Street, which acts as the main entrance. The building style is rustic gothic, composed of stone in irregular coursed work, with red <b>brick</b> <b>moulded</b> windows and door jambs. There are <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> dripstones rising from pliaster and terra cotta corbels. The window sills, plinths, mouldings and steps of buttresses are rendered in cement stucco. The buildings exterior is rough stone and brickwork with the brick pointed, {{in black and white}} mortar. The tower is 75 ft tall with an octagonal spire.|$|R

5000|$|Mills became wider, Houldsworth Mill, Reddish (1865) was 35 m {{wide and}} {{accommodated}} 1200 spindle mules. It was of four storeys and had sixteen bays {{on each side}} of a central engine house; a double mill. The central block provided offices and warehousing. A mill had a range of ancillary buildings. [...] Stair columns often extending above the mill and housed a water tank for the sprinkler system. The floors were higher allowing for taller windows. Accrington brick was used from 1890, decorated with yellow sandstone with <b>moulded</b> <b>brick</b> and terracotta features. Etched and stained glass was used in the offices. Mills were designed by specialist architects and architectural quality became a major consideration.|$|R
