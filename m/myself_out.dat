My flat's nothing special – two rooms – and I live as frugally as I possibly can to make sure I can campaign. I'm not trying to make <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> to be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|E
500|$|Ellen Wilkinson {{was born}} on 8 October 1891, at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester {{district}} of Chorlton-on-Medlock. She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker who became an insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen, née Wood. Richard Wilkinson was a pillar of his local Wesleyan Methodist church, and combined {{a strong sense of}} social justice with forthright views on self-help; rather than espousing working-class solidarity his view, according to Ellen, was: [...] "I have pulled <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of the gutter, why can't they?" [...] Entirely self-educated, he ensured that his children received the best schooling available, encouraged them to read widely, and inculcated strong Christian principles.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, music journalist Ray Coleman {{said that the}} song's lyrics, together with the yearning quality of Harrison's singing and guitar playing on the track, [...] "will raise questions about its relevance to his personal life". The song begins with the lines [...] "Found <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> on a limb / But I'm happier than I've ever been", the second of which echoes Harrison's statement to Fong-Torres {{that he had never}} been as happy as he was now – in a band with Scott, Billy Preston and Willie Weeks, and as a servant of the Hindu god Krishna instead of living out the public's perception of him as [...] "Beatle George".|$|E

500|$|Windle {{retired after}} the Games, noting that [...] "I have swum {{to that point}} when I could hardly lift <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. I would always give 110%. There is no {{substitute}} for hard and honest work". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E

500|$|Webb's mother, {{a gifted}} classically trained pianist, {{encouraged}} his musical interests {{at a very}} young age. Music came naturally to him, and he began to play the guitar at six years old. Concerning his musical training, Webb explains that he got his ear for music from his mother, but not the ability to read music, and that he [...] "took one [...] lesson and then just taught <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of the book." [...] While in high school, he became known for his skill on the guitar. He toured with a band, though it broke up in his junior year following a serious car accident returning from playing a show at Baylor University. Webb graduated from Klein High School in Klein, Texas in 1992. Before joining Caedmon's Call, he went to community college in Houston for half a semester, and shared an apartment with his older brother who was attending medical school.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen gave {{an account}} of his {{introduction}} to music: [...] "I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when {{in bed with the}} measles, I had tried <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> on the little violin". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to put <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. If I can help someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, Aaliyah {{finished}} {{recording the}} album after having filmed her part in Queen of the Damned for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are {{times in my life}} [...] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure <b>myself</b> <b>out.</b> I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally." [...] Aaliyah was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E

The thing about the super-synthesis is you choose one opus magnum, a huge work to do, then you chose 12 other non related projects that you’re meant to take to mastery and so I’ve finished pretty much everything and now is the execution of all of these – some of which I’ve done … ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's 1999 double album The Fragile was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, selling over two million copies {{by the end of}} the year. However, it failed to attain the success of its predecessor and fell from the top of the Billboard after only a week. Afterwards, the only original Nine Inch Nails material released until 2005 was the 2000 remix album Things Falling Apart, as well as the 2001 single [...] "Deep" [...] from the [...] and Still. Reznor told Spin magazine in 2005 that [...] "I was going to just drink myself or drug <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> of it.

2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure <b>myself</b> <b>out,</b> {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{composing}} two songs, Jorgensen {{considered it}} [...] "easier" [...] writing {{from the perspective}} of being dead. He thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to expand it into a story where he kept [...] "pretending I was dead. I kinda creeped <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> sometimes." [...] Around this time, Jorgensen was going through a break-up [...] "of my first real relationship, which was heartbreaking," [...] combined with [...] "the fact that I had been touring {{for a couple of years}} with Armor for Sleep ... It was a very transitional period, and all those emotions converged." [...] He initially composed the songs before showing them to the rest of the band. Jorgensen wrote the lyrics in isolation. He later pondered [...] "maybe I should have asked for help but it was something I wanted to be from me completely". According to Decicco, every song on the album is in Drop D tuning, often incorporating a ninth chord, which gave a [...] "super rich" [...] sound.|$|E
6000|$|Voices {{were heard}} {{at the end}} of the corridor. Mrs. Ambrose was {{speaking}} low; William Pepper was remarking in his definite and rather acid voice, [...] "That is the type of lady with whom I find <b>myself</b> distinctly <b>out</b> of sympathy. She--" ...|$|R
