40|$|There is a {{controversy}} regarding {{whether there are}} thyrotropin (TSH) receptors in orbital fat and eye <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> that {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy. To elucidate whether there are TSH receptors in orbital fat and eye <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, we applied the method of in situ hybridization in orbital fat and eye <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> obtained during the operation for patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, to directly detect TSH receptor mRNA. To identify whether the cells with positive TSH receptor mRNA are fibroblasts, we also did vimentin immunoreactivity study. To further prove the transcript does have a full length of TSH receptor, the samples of total RNA preparations, extracted from orbital fat and eye <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues,</b> were used as a template for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using three primer sets to generate cDNA fragments and cloned for sequencing. The results showed that the expression of TSH receptor mRNA was demonstrated in adipocytes and fibroblasts of orbital fat, and perimysial fibroblasts within eye <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> by in situ hybridization and vimentin immunoreactivity study. Also, by using the RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing, we further proved that the transcript does have a full length of TSH receptor.

5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue</b> rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E

5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (<b>muscle</b> <b>tissue</b> destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E

5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue,</b> to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, when more than 50% of the potassium in the <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue</b> of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue</b> surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{contractile}} {{activation of}} airway smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> stimulates actin polymerization, and the inhibition of actin polymerization inhibits tension development. Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) and cofilin {{are members of}} a family of actin-binding proteins that mediate the severing of F-actin when activated by dephosphorylation at serine 3. The role of ADF/cofilin activation in the regulation of actin dynamics and tension development during the contractile activation of smooth muscle was evaluated in intact canine tracheal smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues.</b> Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that ADF and cofilin exist in similar proportions in the <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues,</b> and that ∼ 40 % of the total ADF/cofilin in unstimulated tissues is phosphorylated. Phospho-ADF/cofilin decreased concurrently with tension development in response to stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) or potassium depolarization indicating the activation of ADF/cofilin. Expression of an inactive phospho-cofilin mimetic (cofilin S 3 E) but not wild type cofilin in the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tissues</b> inhibited endogenous ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation and ACh-induced actin polymerization. Expression of cofilin S 3 E in the tissues depressed tension development in response to ACh, but it did not affect myosin light chain phosphorylation. The ACh-induced dephosphorylation of ADF/cofilin required the Ca 2 +-dependent activation of calcineurin (PP 2 B). The results indicate that the activation of ADF/cofilin is regulated by contractile stimulation in tracheal smooth muscle and that cofilin activation is required for actin polymerization and tension development in response to contractile stimulation...|$|R

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue</b> and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue)</b> and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the <b>muscle</b> <b>tissue.</b> When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
