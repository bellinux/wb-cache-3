40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 92 per cent of the total radiation emitted by radium in equilibrium with its subsequent products is given off in the form of α-rays. This, however, cannot be utilized when the source is enclosed in an ordinary container, because the α-rays are absorbed completely by even a small thickness of glass. About 3. 2 per cent of the total radiation is emitted in the form of β-rays, and 4. 8 per cent as gamma radiation. The effects produced on the radiated mice of these experiments were due mainly to the β-rays, which are easily absorbed by tissue. The γ-rays, being only slightly absorbed by organic matter, probably contributed very little to the observed effects. It is interesting to correlate the different effects produced by the same dose of radiation. The mice which received a dose of 1. 9 <b>millicurie</b> hours showed no local effects on the skin or hair. Neither females nor males were sterilized, and the time at which they opened their eyes or reached sexual maturity was not affected, as far as we could tell. The only difference noted between the radiated animals and the controls was in the body weight. This dose accelerated the growth of the young mice, that is, while initially of the same weight, soon after irradiation they became distinctly bigger than the controls, but finally the animals of each group had substantially the same average weight. That this variation in body weight should be accidental is unlikely, since it was observed also in the animals treated by a slightly larger dose (2. 4 <b>millicurie</b> hours). The number of animals (seven) which showed this effect is too small to prove conclusively the accelerating effect of small doses of radiation on the body growth of mice. But considering that similar results have been. obtained by radiating plants and beetles, it is reasonable that the observed increase in weight might be attributed, at least in part, to the effects of radiation. Since this paper was first written Russ, Chambers, and Scott have shown that small doses of x-rays accelerate the body growth of rats. In view of this additional evidence {{there can be little doubt}} that the increase in weight observed in our experiments was due to the radiation. A dose of 2. 4 <b>millicurie</b> hours applied over the backs of the animals produced no local skin effects, but it accelerated the growth of the mice as in the previous case. In addition it caused permanent sterilization of all the females. A similar result was obtained with 4. 9 <b>millicurie</b> hours, except that the effect on the rate of growth was uncertain. A dose of 6. 8 <b>millicurie</b> hours produced a definite but mild skin erythema and retarded the development of lanugo hair. But since in this instance the emanation was applied over the heads of the animals, the dose reaching the ovaries was not sufficient to cause sterilization, as already explained. No other definite effect was noted. In connection with the sterilization of the females it should be noted that a dose of radiation which produced no visible skin changes was sufficient to cause permanent sterility. On account of the greater distance of the ovaries from the source of radiation as compared with that of the skin directly below the tube, and the depth of tissue which the rays had to traverse to reach the ovaries, the amount of radiation acting on the latter was much smaller than the amount falling on the skin. The radiation emitted by the emanation tube is reduced to about 50 per cent of its initial value after traversing 1 mm. of tissue. Still, while the skin was not visibly affected, the mice were sterilized. This shows that the ovaries are influenced very easily by radiation of this type. We can estimate the amount of radiation reaching the ovaries which is sufficient to cause sterility to be less than 25 per cent of the amount necessary to produce visible skin changes in the mice. It should be noted also that whenever sterility of the female mice was induced, it was permanent. Furthermore, those mice which were not rendered sterile by radiation were, as far as the experiments enable us to say, as prolific as the controls. Remembering that a dose of 1. 9 <b>millicurie</b> hours had no apparent effect on the ovaries, while a slightly larger dose, 2. 4 <b>millicurie</b> hours, caused permanent sterility, it might be concluded that it is not possible to produce temporary sterility by radiation. We know, however, that temporary sterility can be produced, at least when the animals are radiated at a later stage in their development. The mice in our experiments were radiated for the first time soon after birth, and it is not improbable that under these conditions temporary sterility cannot be obtained. Large sublethal doses produced severe skin burns, retarded the body growth of the animals, but failed to sterilize the males. About one-third of the total skin area of the mice showed marked effects from the radiation. The animals were very sick for a time, and their growth was temporarily stunted. But nevertheless they recovered and finally became apparently normal except for the narrow hairless strip of skin which had been closest to the emanation tube. Only the females were rendered permanently sterile. The males did not show even temporary sterility when the doses of radiation were close to the lethal dose. While the testes of mammals are known to be very easily affected by radiation, still they are more resistant than the ovaries. In addition, in these experiments they were at a greater distance from the source of radiation than the ovaries, and they were better protected by the thicker layer of tissue in the path of the rays. The fact that no sublethal dose in these experiments sterilized the males shows that under the conditions of irradiation adopted the amount of radiation reaching the testes was not sufficient to affect them noticeably. If the source of radiation had been applied closer to the reproductive organs of the males, they would have been sterilized by <b>millicurie</b> hour doses much smaller than the lethal dose. Some of the radiated animals were killed with ether, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the reproductive organs were made. The ovaries of the sterile females were generally atrophied and colored yellow. The normal histological structure was altered. The characteristic findings were the destruction of the Graafian follicles, with absence of ovum cells. The testes and the epididymis of the radiated mice of the present experiment appeared macroscopically and histologically normal, with the presence of abundant spermatozoa. Owing to the method adopted for the irradiation of the mice, the testes were too far from the source of radiation, and too well protected by the intervening tissue to be definitely affected by the rays...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Lymphedema is the edema {{that results}} from chronic lymphatic insufficiency. Lymphatic {{filariasis}} {{is caused by the}} filarial nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Lymphatic filariasis is common in tropical and subtropical regions. Early diagnosis and prompt therapy can be implemented using lymphoscintigraphy. Our patient is a 15 -year-old boy presenting with a 3 -month history of hydrocele. The patient was referred to us to rule out any lower limb lymphatic obstruction as the patient is from an endemic area. Tc Sulfur colloid (filtered) lymphoscintigraphy showed abnormal tracer collection in the scrotum and penis. There is associated dermal backflow or stasis in the left thigh region extending just above the knee, suggesting partial obstruction of left inguinal lymphatic channels. Lymphatic filariasis is common in tropical and subtropical regions. 1 A 15 -year-old boy presented with 3 months of scrotal edema. Although residence in a tropical area raises a high sus-picion for lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, which can usually be diagnosed with an antigen detection card test, this patient was evaluated for lymphatic obstruction.

40|$|The lack of {{calibration}} to a {{wide range}} of well conditions has limited the application of the University of Arizona’s neutron instruments. The calibration is necessary before quantitative results may be obtained. A survey of the literature on the neutron method is presented from petroleum industry, soil science, and groundwater hydrology sources. A controlled system, consisting of nine well casings in a homogeneous unconsolidated medium, was constructed, for the study. Two neutron-neutron instruments equipped with Am-Be sources of lOO-mc (<b>millicurie)</b> and 3 -c (curie) strength, were operated in the system. Data was collected under saturated and water-table conditions to determine the quantitative reaction and the qualitative discrimination of the instruments to the range of variables encountered in well design. The diameter and composition of well casing and the position of the neutron probe in the casing were found to be important factors in neutron logging. The largest diameter of casing in which the 100 -mo instrument can be applied was found to be 4 inches. The 3 -c instrument was effective in casings as large as 16 inches in diameter. The calibration relationship between moisture content and chart deflection for the 3 -c instrument was defined for one value of moisture content...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{radiological}} contaminants, primarily uranium, {{into the atmosphere}} at the Y- 12 Plant occurs almost exclusively {{as a result of}} plant production, maintenance, and waste management activities. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) regulations for radionuclides require continuous emission sampling of major sources [a “major source ” is considered to be any emission point that potentially can contribute> 0. 1 mrem/year effective dose equivalent (EDE) to an off-site individual]. During 1998, 45 of the Y- 12 Plant’s 57 stacks were judged to be major sources. Five of these sources were not operational in 1998 because of work in progress on process or stack modifications. Eighteen of the stacks having the greatest potential to emit significant amounts of uranium are equipped with alarmed breakthrough detectors, which alert operations personnel to processupset conditions or to a decline in filtration-system efficiencies, allowing them to investigate and correct the problem before a significant release occurs. As of January 1, 1998, the Y- 12 Plant had a total of 57 stacks, 51 active and 6 temporarily shut down. No stacks were permanently shut down in 1998. Thus, 51 active stacks were being monitored at the end of 1998.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{concentration}} of radioiodinated (Fab') 2 fragments of cardiac specific antimyosin antibody in myocardial infarcts {{has been shown}} previously to be inversely proportional to regional myocardial blood flow. The myocardial localization of antibody fragments has also been visualized by gamma camera scin-tigraphy. We now correlate the site of 121 I-antimyosin (Fab') 2 uptake with histochemical and histologic evidence of myocardial infarction. One <b>millicurie</b> of ' 21 I-antimyosin (Fab') 2 was administered intravenously 4 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to anesthetized dogs. The dogs were allowed to recover for 48 hours. The hearts were then excised, perfused with 1 % triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and formalin-fixed. One-centimeter-thick transverse slices were cut; gamma scintigrams for 1251 I-antimyosin (Fab') 2 localization, macro- and microautoradiograms and histologic studies were performed. Samples of the remaining tissues were assayed for 1251 activity by gamma scintillation counting. Comparison of areas of 1251 _ antimyosin (Fab') 2 uptake on scintigrams and macroautoradiograms with TTC infarct location and size showed close correlation. Maximal ratios of ' 261 -antimyosin (Fab') 2 between infarcted and normal tissue (48 ± 13 [SEM]) were in the subendocardium at the infarct center in areas of most severe cellular necrosis. Microautoradiographic studies showed maximal grain density at the region of maximal myocyte necrosis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} useable {{tungsten}} (W) /tantalum (Ta) generator. Ta- 178 is formed following the decay of its parent, W- 178 (half-life: 21. 7 d) and has a half life of 9. 3 minutes in turn yielding stable Hf- 178. The decay of the parent isotope (W- 178) occurs entirely by electron capture to the 9. 3 minute Ta- 178 state, without feeding the high spin Ta- 178 isomer (half life 2. 2 hours). In Ta- 178 decay, 99. 2 % of the disintegrations proceed by electron capture and 0. 18 % by positron emission. Electron capture results in a 61. 2 % branch to the ground state of Hf- 178 and 33. 7 % to the first excited state at 93 1 KeV. The most prominent features of the radionuclide's energy spectrum are the hafnium characteristic radiation peaks with energies between 54. 6 and 65. 0 KeV. The radiation exposure dose of Ta- 118 was calculated to be approximately one-twentieth that of Tc- 99 m on a per <b>millicurie</b> basis. A twenty-fold reduction in radiation exposure from Ta- 178 compared with Tc- 99 m means that the usual administered dose can be increased three or four times, greatly increasing statistical accuracy while reducing radiation exposure by a factor of five...|$|E
40|$|An {{ethylene}} binding component(s) {{has been}} partially purified from mung bean sprouts. Tissue was homogenized in 0. 3 molar sucrose and 0. 2 molar potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0).

The cellulose was transferred to separate containers and the [14 C]ethylene was absorbed in mercury perchlorate and counted. Distribution of ethylene binding to various fractions was: 0 to 3, 000 g, 3 %; 3, 000 to 12, 000 g; 4 %; 12, 000 to 100, 000 g, 69 %; cellular debris, 24 %; 100, 000 g supernatant, 0 %. Adjustment of the pH to 4. 0 precipitates the ethylene-binding component. Neutralization, addition of Triton X- 100, and readjustment of the pH to 4. 0 “solubilized” most of the binding component. Further purification was obtained by chromatography on CM-Sephadex in 10 millimolar potassium acetate buffer, (pH 5. 0) containing 1 % Triton X- 100. Elution was with 200 millimolar potassium phosphate (pH 6. 0) containing 1 % Triton X- 100. Upon treatment of the Triton “solubilized” component with cold acetone, over 90 % of the binding capacity was lost. Extraction of the acetone-precipitated residue with 2 % Triton X- 100 restored some of the binding capacity which was found in the soluble fraction. The pH optimum for binding is 6. 0.

In order to evaluate the effects of treatment in terms of the quantity of emanation, cancerous growths were examined both macroscopically and microscopically several times before, during and after the treatment. 1. Having been subjected to contact irradiation of Co^ of a total of about 3, 840 <b>millicurie</b> hours, the cancerous tissue showed sudden destruction, contraction in size, disappearance and cicatrization in gross appearance. Histologic sections showed disturbance of the stroma, with attendant changes in the vessels, and secondary proliferation of the connective tissue, in addition to marked degeneration of the cancer cells. The cancer cells, which had disappeared, were replaced by the connective tissue 1 month after treatment. 2. There was no essential difference between the changes brought about by radium and cobalt irradiation. 3. The behavior of the eosinophile leukocytes and argyrophil fibrils was studied in terms of the quantity of emanation. It was shown that the former might be related in some way to retrogression of the cancerous growth, and that the latter had comparatively strong resistance to irradiation, for they were still idntified in necrotic area, thought they had become thicker or finer, or was broken to pieces as a result of irradiation. 4. The degree of ripeness of the cancerous tissue may vary from one location to another in one cancerous growth. This indicates that it is difficult to advance any valid discussion on the relation of the degree of ripeness of the cancerous tissue to radio sensibility merely on the basis of microscopic findings on a small experimental section...|$|E

While salivary and lacrimal glandular complications secondary to 131 I therapy are well documented, there is little in the literature addressing nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). We aimed to evaluate the frequency of 131 I therapy-acquired NLDO, its correlation to 131 I therapy doses, and the surgical treatment outcome of this rare side effect. Methods: From 2000 – 2012, a retrospective review of 864 among 1, 192 patients with confirmed DTC who were treated with 131 I therapy was performed to examine the frequency of NLDO, its causative factors, as well as imaging, surgical intervention, and outcomes. Results: Nineteen (2. 2 %) patients were identified with NLDO. The mean age was 51. 9 ± 10. 5  years (range: 39 – 72 years). Fifteen (78. 9 %) were female and four were male (21. 1 %). The mean individual 131 I doses were 311. 1 ± 169. 3 <b>millicurie</b> (mCi) (range: 150 – 600  mCi). The mean duration between the date of 131 I therapy and the occurrence of NLDO was 11. 6 ± 4. 1  months (range: 6. 5 – 20). Fourteen (73. 7 %) patients had bilateral epiphora. Computed tomography dacryography allowed for the detection of all NLDO. Eighteen (94. 7 %) patients underwent dacryocystorhinostomy. Complete recovery was obtained in 14 (73. 7 %) patients. Age > 45  years and 131 I therapy doses > 150 mCi were significantly correlated with NLDO (P= 0. 02 and P= 0. 03, respectively). Conclusion: NLDO is an underestimated complication of 131 I therapy in DTC patients. Clinicians should be aware of this rare complication for prompt intervention.
