40|$|LYSOLECITHN {{has been}} widely studied as a {{surface-active}} haemolytic agent (Robinson, 1961) and has been implicated in immune haemolysis (Fischer, 1964), in hypersensitivity reactions (Middleton and Phillips, 1963, 1964), and in the delayed stage of the increase of vascular permeability in inflammation (Cotran and Majno, 1964). Fischer (1964) found that the oxygen uptake (Q 02) of tumour cells was reduced by small concentrations of "lysolecithin ", while micro and macrophages responded by an increase Of Q 02 and phagocytic activity. We felt that this observation should be confirmed, because it could {{form the basis of}} a therapeutic method of increasing the radiosensitivity of tumours by raising the oxygen tension (PO 2), and from the theoretical aspect might clarify differences between the cell membranes of tumour and of normal cells.

40|$|Present day {{advanced}} technologies heavily rely {{on one particular}} class of matter, i. e. the crystals. It is the periodic nature of the atoms and the properties arising due to the periodicity in crystals that is exploited to meet various technological feats. The technological revolutions in the semiconductor, optics and communication industries are the examples. The anisotropy in the crystals gives them enhanced properties as required {{in the field of}} non-linear optics. The field of non-linear optics became practically a reality after the invention of lasers. The coherent and monochromatic optical beams in the visible and ultraviolet ranges are in high demand due to their application in the fields like material processing, semiconductor lithography, laser micromachining,	laser spectroscopy, photochemical synthesis, inertial confinement fusion and other basic scientific studies. In this thesis, work on the growth and characterization of two technologically important non-linear optical crystals has been carried out after developing the necessary instrumentation and some novel techniques for synthesis and growth. Also, studies on the glassy nature of one of the crystals have been carried out. This thesis consists of seven chapters. The first chapter gives a brief introduction to the nonlinear optical phenomenon, crystal growth and glassy state. Instrumentation is the backbone of crystal research technology. Without precision growth equipments large size crystals cannot be grown and without precision characterization instrumentation no conclusion regarding the quality and usefulness of the grown material can be drawn. The work reported in Chapter 2 describes the instrumentation developed for the growth, processing and characterization of crystals grown by solution and melt growth techniques. In low temperature solution growth, crystal growth workstations have been developed using tanks (made of acrylic), heating elements, and stirring propellers. Cooling coils have been inserted into the designed water bath to grow crystals below ambient also. This bath has an advantage to work over a wide range of temperatures, so that maximum retrieval of the material is possible. The growth of large crystals is usually hindered due to spurious nucleation precipitating during the growth process. A novel nucleation-trap crystallizer has been designed and developed that facilitates the continuation of the growth run in spite of extra nucleation precipitating after seeding. In this crystallizer, the spurious nuclei and any other particles generated after the filtration are forced into a well, and the growth of spurious nuclei is arrested by manipulating the temperature of this trap. Achieving adequate heat flow and mass flow profiles is of vital importance for growing good quality crystals. An optimized stirring procedure for the solution or melt is needed for ensuring the desired supply of growth units to the crystal-nutrient interface, and for transporting away any debris of the crystal-growth process. An ACRT set up has been designed and developed. For the growth of crystals by the flux technique and from direct melt, a crystal puller has been designed and developed. The crystal puller consists of a crystal rotation unit, slow and fast pulling mechanisms and a control unit. The pulling assembly is protected from damage caused by possible human errors through interlock mechanisms. The vibration at the shaft of the seed rotation assembly has been minimized by using a dc motor for rotation. A versatile triangular / square wave oscillator has been designed for developing a dc motor control. By implementing this control, the speed of the motor does not vary with supply-voltage variations. A quarter-step switching logic sequence is introduced for stepper motors, which is used for the slow UP/DOWN movement of the puller. This puller can be controlled locally by a control panel provided with the puller, or through a PC remotely by bypassing the local control. Additionally, for the processing and characterization of the grown DKDP crystals, a closed-loop thread-cutter, a ferroelectric loop tracer, and a computer-controlled system for measuring the half-wave voltage have been developed. A novel mercury encapsulant seeding technique that facilitates the processing of solution with immersed seed is invented and has been described in Chapter 3. This technique allows processing of solution with the seed inside the growth chamber, and still avoids contamination of the solution and formation of crystal clusters that are normally generated when seed is inserted after processing of the solution. DKDP and KAP crystal seeds have been used to check the dissolution of seeds, if any, when immersed in pure water for several hours and at high temperatures after introducing the seal. It has been observed that the <b>mercury</b> <b>seal</b> does not allow creeping of water into the seed holder, and there is no dissolution of the seed. This technique has been practically implemented for the growth of crystals from aqueous solution and its usefulness has been demonstrated by growing ammonium acid phthalate, potassium acid phthalate and potassium di-deuterium phosphate crystals. Nonlinear-optical crystals find major use in inertial-confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. For such applications, nonlinear crystals with very large damage-resistance are needed. Alternatively, crystals with moderate damage resistance but large size can be used for frequency-conversion for efficient plasma experiments. Potassium di-hydrogen phosphate, KH 2 PO 4 (KDP) and its deuterated analog, K(DxH 1 -x) 2 PO 4 (DKDP) are at present the only nonlinear optical crystals which can be grown to large sizes and are suitable for ICF studies. Also, solid-state light valves, light deflectors, and laser communication devices require large and perfect tetragonal DKDP crystals, with high deuterium concentration for easier operation. Chapter 4 describes the growth and characterization of DKDP crystals. DKDP crystals have been grown by all the three techniques i. e. conventional, platform and novel mercury encapsulant seeding techniques. Details about a new approach for the synthesis of DKDP solution have been given. A comparative study of the grown crystals by mercury-encapsulant technique and other techniques is described. Habit modification was observed due to the placement of seed crystals at an off-centre position and orientation in mercury encapsulant seeding technique and has been discussed. The grown crystals have been characterized for homogeneity, dislocations, transmission, DSC, rockng curve, etc. Due to the higher photon energies and the ability to be more tightly focused, coherent radiations of shorter wavelength (deep-UV) are in demand. The photon energies in this region are sufficient for bond-breaking processes in many materials, and find applications in fields like material processing, semiconductor lithography, laser micromachining, laser spectroscopy, photochemical synthesis, etc. Although excimer lasers (XeCl, KrF, ArF etc.) produce significant power in the deep-UV region, these laser systems involve corrosive gases, and are bulky, apart from requiring regular maintenance. A maintenance-free, compact, solid-state laser is preferable. But this, in turn, requires an efficient NLO crystal in that region. CLBO is one such crystal. Growth of CLBO crystals has been carried out by the flux-growth technique using B 2 O 3 -deficient flux, as well as from stoichiometric melt and has been discussed in Chapter 5. It was observed that the nucleation of material on platinum wire or spontaneous nucleation was difficult to achieve in spite of high supercooling. After forcing cracks into the mass deposited on platinum wire nucleation could be achieved. The growth of crystals was carried out on seeds with different orientations. Transmission studies, etch-pit studies and harmonic-generation experiments were performed on the grown crystals. The glass-forming tendency of CLBO has been studied and reported in Chapter 6. DTA experiments show that CLBO melt generally transforms to glass on cooling. Even at a cooling rate as low as 1 °C/min, the material does not crystallize but transforms into glass. Ergodicity making and glass transition temperatures were determined for glassy CLBO. Since neither the crystallization peak nor the melting peak was observed in DTA experiments during the heating part of thermal cycle for glassy CLBO, a new approach of seeded crystallization was adopted in the calorimetric experiments to achieve crystallization. Since the size of added nuclei is already above the critical radius, the onset of crystallization peaks is independent of the critical-radius energy barrier. Kissenger method was applied to determine the activation energy of seeded- crystallization process. The transformation of glass CLBO to the crystalline phase is mediated by dendrites. Possibility of bulk crystal growth from the glassy state has been discussed, and a novel idea of surface crystallization is proposed. Chapter 7 summarizes the work carried out and projects the scope for future work...|$|E

In a farm near the church lived the local medic, one Jan van Helmont, a follower of the teachings of Paracelsus. His son Mercurius, a close friend, tutor and collaborator of Leibniz, records that one evening, a stranger knocked at the door and was admitted. The two men talked late into the night about alchemy, and on leaving, the stranger left van Helmont with some unusual powder: he immediately mixed it with eight ounces of <b>mercury,</b> <b>sealed</b> in a clay crucible which was heated over the fire for twenty minutes, and broke the pot - to find eight ounces of gold. There are some suggestions that this visitor may have been a researcher who had had a significant hand in events leading up to the execution of the Counts of Egmont and Hoorne for heresy in 1568. This opened van Helmont's eyes to the possibility of scientific process, and he went on {{to become one of the}} founding fathers of modern chemistry.|$|R

The study population comprised 2, 224 Inuit, age 18 + (43 % men); data collected 2005 &#x 2013; 2008 in Greenland. Using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), we calculated consumption of seal, whale, and fish (g/day) and as meals/month, intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), total N 3, and mercury. We measured erythrocyte membrane fatty acids (FA) and whole blood mercury (Hg). Associations were assessed by Pearson correlation and {{agreement between the}} 2 methods was assessed by Bland&#x 2013;Altman plots depicting mean difference between the methods. Using multiple linear regressions, the associations were studied between whole blood mercury, erythrocyte FA and frequency or gram per day of seal, whale, and fish. Results. Partial correlations ranged from r= 0. 16, p&# 60; 0. 0001 (DHA) to r= 0. 56, p&# 60; 0. 0001 (mercury). The best fitted lines were found for mercury and DHA.

40|$|The use {{of surface}} coils in MR imaging {{allows for the}} {{possibility}} of obtaining images with increased signal-to-noise ratio and increased spatial resolution [1]. To obtain the max-imum signal, the coil should be placed close to the region to be imaged. For rigid coils, a close fit may be difficult to obtain routinely and can lead to patient discomfort. We describe a technique for constructing flexible coils that use liquid mercury as the conductor. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at ordinary room temperature, and as such permits the fabrica-tion of highly flexible coils. Coil Construction We have constructed a number of mercury surface coils by filling lengths of flexible plastiC tubing with <b>mercury</b> and <b>sealing</b> the tube ends with plugs made from copper and epoxy cement. Figure 1 shows 33 -cm and 48 -cm lengths of the mercury-filled tubing so constructed; in this figure the end plugs of the 33 -cm-long element have been soldered to tabs on a circuit board to form a one-loop coil. Figure 1 also illustrates the flexibility of the coil. For these coils, we used % 2 -inch (O. 4 -cm) inside diameter tubing to contain the mercury and %-inch (0. 6 -cm) outside diameter copper tubing in making the end plugs; these dimensions are not critical. Figure 2 shows the relevant details of the end plug design, which was chosen to ensure good contact between the mercury and the copper. The copper serves as a point for soldering the coil to an electronic circuit used to tune the coil to the resonant frequency and match it to the receiver input impedance. On the imager we are using (Philips Gyroscan), this tuning and matching is accomplished by variable capacitor diodes, contained on the circuit board shown in figure 1, and allows these operations to be done while the coil and patient are positioned inside the imager.

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Mercury (Hg), aside from having high toxic-ity, {{is characterized by}} its ability to biomagnify in the marine trophic chain. This is an important problem especially in estuaries, or in the coastal zone, particular-ly near the mouths of large rivers. This {{study was conducted in}} the years 2001 – 2011, in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea near to the mouth of the River Vistula, which is the second biggest river discharging into the Baltic. Mercury concentration was measured in the tis-sues and organs of cod, flounder, herring, seals (living in the wild and in captivity), great black-backed gulls, and African penguins from Gdańsk Zoo, and also in human hair. Penguins and seals at the seal sanctuary in Hel were fed only herring. In marine birds and mammals and in the pelagic herring, the highest Hg concentration was observed in the kidney and in the liver, while in cod and flounder (located on a higher trophic level) the muscles were the most contaminated with <b>mercury.</b> In gray <b>seals</b> living in the seal sanctuary, Hg concentration in all analyzed tissues and organs except the kidneys was lower in comparison with seals living in the wild. The comparatively small share of fish in the diet of local Polish people and their preference towards the con-sumption of herring contributed to low concentration of Hg in their hair. The protective mechanisms related to detoxification and elimination of mercury were shown to be more effective in the seals than in the penguins, despite the former consuming around 10 times more food per day...|$|R
5000|$|While still {{attached}} to the manifold, the tube is allowed to cool while pumping down to the lowest pressure the system can achieve. It is then filled to a low pressure of a few torrs (millimeters of mercury) {{with one of the}} noble gases, or a mixture of them, and sometimes a small amount of mercury. This gas fill pressure represents roughly 1/100th of the pressure of the atmosphere. The required pressure depends on the gas used and the diameter of the tube, with optimal values ranging from [...] (for a long 20 mm tube filled with argon/mercury) to [...] (for a short 8 mm diameter tube filled with pure neon). Neon or argon are the most common gases used; krypton, xenon, and helium are used by artists for special purposes but are not used alone in normal signs. A premixed combination of argon and helium is often used in lieu of pure argon when a tube is to be installed in a cold climate, since the helium increases voltage drop (and thus power dissipation), warming the tube to operating temperature faster. Neon glows bright red or reddish orange when lit. When argon or argon/helium is used, a tiny droplet of mercury is added. Argon by itself is very dim pale lavender when lit, but the droplet of mercury fills the tube with <b>mercury</b> vapor when <b>sealed,</b> which then emits ultraviolet light upon electrification. This ultraviolet emission allows finished argon/mercury tubes to glow with a variety of bright colors when the tube has been coated on the interior with ultraviolet-sensitive phosphors after being bent into shape.|$|R
