5|$|Due to {{its length}} and musical scope, most reviews of Exile on <b>Main</b> <b>St.</b> glossed over the album's {{individual}} songs {{to focus on}} the album as a whole. However, Lenny Kaye, in his review for Rolling Stone, took a paragraph to describe the song.|$|E
5|$|PA 21 enters Fayette County in {{the borough}} of Masontown.

It turns to the northeast entering German Township and leaving PA 166. Passing through McClellandtown, PA 21 traverses more densely populated western Fayette County entering South Union Township. The highway enters South Union Township in the village of Uledi. It intersects Dixon Boulevard before entering the city of Uniontown. It has an interchange with U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 119 near Cherry Tree Square. It passes the Uniontown Hospital before ending at US Route 40 Business (<b>Main</b> <b>St.).</b>|$|E

5|$|The episode also sparked renewed {{interest}} in Fleetwood Mac and its most commercially successful album, and Rumours reentered the Billboard 200 chart at number twelve, the same week that Nicks' new solo album In Your Dreams debuted at number six. The two recordings sold {{a little less than}} 30,000 and 52,000 units, respectively. Music downloads accounted for ninety-one percent of the Rumours sales. The spike in sales for Rumours represented an uptick of 1,951%, and it had the highest US chart entry by a previously issued album since The Rolling Stones' reissue of Exile on <b>Main</b> <b>St.</b> entered the chart at number two on June 5, 2010. In Australia, the interest had an even more profound effect: five days after the episode aired, the Rumours album entered the Australian charts at number two, and was at number three the following week. Most sales came from digital downloads. In all, the album was in the top forty for nine consecutive weeks. Rumours received its 13× Platinum certification in Australia at the end of May 2011.|$|E
