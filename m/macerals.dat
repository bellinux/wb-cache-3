Telalginite is defined as {{structured}} organic matter composed of large colonial or thick-walled unicellular algae such as Botryococcus and Tasmanites. Lamalginite includes thin-walled colonial or unicellular algae that occur as distinct laminae, but display few or no recognizable biologic structures. Under the microscope, telalginite and lamalginite are easily recognized by their bright shades of yellow under ultraviolet/blue fluorescent light. Bituminite is largely amorphous, lacks recognizable biologic structures, and displays relatively low fluorescence under the microscope. Other organic constituents include vitrinite and inertinite, which are <b>macerals</b> derived from the humic matter of land plants.

500|$|Oil shale geology is {{a branch}} of {{geologic}} sciences which studies the formation and composition of oil shalesfine-grained sedimentary rocks containing significant amounts of kerogen, and belonging {{to the group of}} sapropel fuels. [...] Oil shale formation takes place in a number of depositional settings and has considerable compositional variation. Oil shales can be classified by their composition (carbonate minerals such as calcite or detrital minerals such as quartz and clays) or by their depositional environment (large lakes, shallow marine, and lagoon/small lake settings). Much of the organic matter in oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants. Three major type of organic matter (<b>macerals)</b> in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals which include vanadium, zinc, copper, uranium.|$|E

The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as feed coals to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the <b>maceral</b> and char formation distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The <b>maceral</b> distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. <b>Maceral</b> distribution was further divided into total reactive <b>maceral</b> particles, total inert <b>maceral</b> particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive <b>maceral</b> particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite <b>maceral</b> group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive <b>maceral</b> particles and lower content of total inert <b>maceral</b> particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive <b>maceral</b> particles and high content of total inert <b>maceral</b> particles. This variation in <b>maceral</b> group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to inert <b>maceral</b> particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a feed coal with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the feed coal with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is <b>maceral</b> association; it was observed that <b>maceral</b> distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|Petrographic {{investigations}} of tropical peat deposits from the Tasek Bera Basin, Malaysia, show that petrographic methods can contribute valuable information about paleoecological settings of mire deposits. Comparing modern peat-forming environments and the pre-maceral composition of peat samples allows {{the reconstruction of}} paleoecological conditions, such as floral composition, fires, microbial activity, etc., and gives insight into paleodepositional environments. In the past, <b>maceral</b> ratios of coals {{have been used to}} interpret paleodepositional settings of coal deposits. Such a procedure assumes that coal texture and coal <b>maceral</b> composition are dictated solely by the depositional environment, and thus different depositional environments should be clearly discriminated based on <b>maceral</b> ratios. In the modern peat deposits of Tasek Bera, divergent petrographic results occur in similar depositional environments, hence, poor correlation occurs between the petrography, the degree of decomposition, and the depositional environment. Furthermore, from the time of peat deposition, peat is subject to considerable alteration. During subsequent diagenesis, preservation of structured and strongly altered material, such as inertinite, gelified material or funginite, is favoured and results in biased coal <b>maceral</b> compositions. Because <b>maceral</b> indexes in modern peat studies are of little utility in the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental settings, it follows that coal <b>maceral</b> indexes should not be utilized in the future to interpret paleodepositional environments of coals...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{measured}} coke reactivity index (CRI) and coke strength after reaction (CSR) {{determined in}} experiments based on coke formed in pilot-scale coke ovens {{are the two}} main parameters that are employed to evaluate coke for its potential utilization in the blast furnace. Thermoplasticity, such as swelling, permeability and fluidity, chemical reactions, such as the evolution of gases and tars, and thermal changes, such as heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivity, on coal heating are known to dominate the transformation of coal to coke in the coke oven, and determine the CRI and CSR of coke. Coal properties, such as vitrinite and inertinite components, and coking conditions, such as heating rate and particle size, have also been found to influence the physical, chemical and thermal properties during coking. Many studies have previously investigated the swelling of different coals and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates {{as well as the}} influence of heating rate and particle size on swelling during coking. The literature has highlighted the correlations between swelling, mass loss and the properties of the released tars and gases for a range of coals and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates using a number of techniques. However, the correlations between swelling and the dynamic evolution of total volatiles (gases and tars), and the physical and chemical properties of the evolved tars, are made from data collected from independent experiments and therefore the interpretations are not very clear. Previous work compared heat of devolatilisation between thermal coals and coking coals. For coking coals only, the differences in heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivities between high fluidity and low fluidity coking coals also were studied. However, reasons for the differences in the thermal properties of different coals are still unclear. In particular, the effects of coal <b>maceral</b> components on heat of coal devolatilisation and thermal conductivity are still unknown. The potential associations of swelling and thermal changes with the properties of tars for coals and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates are scarcely studied. The main objectives of this study are therefore to identify the sequence of physical, chemical and thermal changes of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke. This work in particular is focused on (a) separation of coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates without using chemicals; (b) simultaneous measurements of swelling and thermal changes of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates from a single experimental run; (c) characterising the dynamic evolution of gases and tars for difference coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates; (d) revealing the mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke thereby correlating the physical, chemical and thermal changes of coal and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates. To achieve the objectives, three novel techniques were employed. A water based device called the Reflux Classifier was employed to separate coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates on the basis of varying settling rates of different density particles. The existing Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique was modified to simultaneously estimate swelling and shrinkage, permeability, apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates. Swelling and shrinkage of the heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> concentrates were measured by the contraction and expansion of a compressible spring. The permeability of heating coal pellet was estimated based on Darcy’s law by the measurements of swelling of coal sample bed and the pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed. The pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed was measured using a pressure sensor. Endothermic and exothermic behaviour of heating samples was evaluated based on the estimated apparent volumetric specific heat. The apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity were estimated by the measurements of the control, surface and centre temperatures of the heating sample. A new technique, Dynamic Elemental Thermal Analysis (DETA), was used to measure the evolution of total volatiles, gases and tars from different coal <b>maceral</b> components. The released tars of <b>maceral</b> concentrates during devolatilisation were condensed using a tar condenser, while the residual tars in char were extracted using solvents of acetone and toluene. The physical properties, such as boiling point, and chemical properties, such as elemental compositions, for condensable and extracted tars also were evaluated using the DETA technique...|$|R
