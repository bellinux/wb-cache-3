50|$|Whilst {{no other}} {{dedicated}} violin-to-MIDI {{systems have been}} manufactured, more generic pitch-to-MIDI systems like those from Roland, and Yamaha {{can be adapted to}} use standard electric violin output. Most systems allow only <b>monophonic</b> <b>operation</b> - only one pitch can be detected and digitised at a time - but through the use of proprietary pickups, some limited MIDI polyphony can be achieved. Some pitch to MIDI interfaces from Axon/TerraTec will give full per string polyphony, interfacing with the multi-pin output from the Zeta MIDI pickup.|$|E
5000|$|In synthesizers legato {{is a type}} of <b>monophonic</b> <b>operation.</b> In {{contrast}} to the typical monophonic mode where every new note rearticulates the sound by restarting the envelope generators, in legato mode the envelopes are not re-triggered if the new note is played [...] "legato" [...] (with the previous note still depressed). This causes the initial transient from the attack and decay phases to sound only once for an entire legato sequence of notes. Envelopes reaching the sustain stage remain there until the final note is released.|$|E
50|$|By design Discovery is a {{subtractive}} synthesizer with 4 voices (2 oscillators each). It {{has built}} in arpeggiator, selection of filters including formant filters, <b>monophonic</b> and polyphonic <b>operation.</b> It is also comes bundled with extensive collection of presets {{and is able}} to import Clavia Nord Lead presets.|$|R
