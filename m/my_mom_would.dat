[...] During an interview with Complex magazine AIko spoke on the video's concept and inspiration saying;“The visual was an ode to the Japanese scary movies. In my mind, I’m a schizophrenic. During the day I go through so many different emotions, at some point every day I’m in a depressed state, even if it’s just for five minutes but I’ll go there and it will be deep and dark. So “3:16” was me staying with it longer and writing about those moments." ...|$|E
