40|$|There is {{a general}} paucity of <b>measured</b> <b>equipment</b> load data for {{laboratories}} and other complex buildings and designers often use estimates based on nameplate rated data or design assumptions from prior projects. Consequently, peak equipment loads are frequently overestimated, and load variation across laboratory spaces within a building is typically underestimated. This results in two design flaws. Firstly, the overestimation of peak equipment loads results in over-sized HVAC systems, increasing initial construction costs as well as energy use due to inefficiencies at low part-load operation. Secondly, HVAC systems that are designed without accurately accounting for equipment load variation across zones can significantly increase simultaneous heating and cooling, particularly for systems that use zone reheat for temperature control. Thus, when designing a laboratory HVAC system, the use of <b>measured</b> <b>equipment</b> load data from a comparable laboratory will support right-sizing HVAC systems and optimizing their configuration to minimize simultaneous heating and cooling, saving initial construction costs as well as life-cycle energy costs. In this paper, we present data from recent studies to support the above thesis. We first present <b>measured</b> <b>equipment</b> load data from two sources: time-series measurements in several laboratory modules in a university research laboratory building; and peak load data for several facilities recorded in a national energy benchmarking database. We then contrast this measured data with estimated values that are typically used for sizing the HVAC systems in these facilities, highlighting the over-sizing problem. Next, we examine the load variation in the time series measurements and analyze {{the impact of this}} variation on energy use, via parametric energy simulations. We then briefly discuss HVAC design solutions that minimize simultaneous heating and cooling energy use...|$|R

Despite the warnings on the navigation charts, the test aircraft was able to navigate by using the MAC VOR during the entire flight. However, the MAC VOR is also equipped with distance <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment,</b> or DME, which provides a means for pilots to know the distance between their aircraft and the VOR/DME station.

25|$|In 1927, Heisenberg {{proved that}} this last {{assumption}} is not correct.

This statement {{is known as}} the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle isn't only a statement about the accuracy of our <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment,</b> but, more deeply, is about the conceptual nature of the measured quantities– the assumption that the car had simultaneously defined position and speed does not work in quantum mechanics.

The latter allowed the airport status as an international airport, which allowed charter flights to Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom, which were often done on a weekly basis by foreign companies involved in the heavy industry. However, the airport did not have status as a permanent border control and the airport therefore had to cover these costs themselves. The Ministry of Justice stated that the airport was too close to Flesland, Haugesund and Sola to have permanent status, but allowed the chief-of-police to give dispensations for individual flights from 1988. In 1987, the airport company lost NOK2 million.|$|E
