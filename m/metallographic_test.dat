However, some of its applications are limited by very poor wear behavior, Gas nitriding is a very effective treatment for producing wear resistant and hard surface layers on the stainless steels without compromising the corrosion resistance. In this work, AISI 316 LN stainless steels samples were gas nitrided at three different timing parameters 8 hrs, 40 hrs and 72 hrs under a pressure of 500 Pa, in order to verify the influence of temperature on the morphology, wear of the modified surface layers. The gas nitrided samples were analyzed by means of various <b>metallographic</b> <b>tests</b> like Optical microscope, X-Ray diffraction. Wear tests were conducted on a pin on disc machine. For the samples which was nitrided, chromium nitrides were formed {{on the surface of}} the layers...|$|R
40|$|The article {{summarizes}} the theoretical knowledge {{from the field}} of brazing of graphitic cast iron, especially by means of conventional flame brazing using a filler metal based on CuZn (CuZn 40 SnSi – brass alloy). The experimental part of the thesis presents the results of performance assessment of brazed joints on other than CuZn basis using silicone (CuSi 3 Mn 1) or aluminium bronze (CuAl 10 Fe). TIG electrical arc was used as a source of heat to melt these filler materials. The results show satisfactory brazed joints with a CuAl 10 Fe filler metal, while pre-heating is not necessary, which favours this method greatly while repairing sizeable castings. The technological procedure recommends the use of AC current with an increased frequency and a modified balance between positive and negative electric arc polarity to focus the heat on a filler metal without melting the base material. The suitability of the joint is evaluated on the basis of visual inspection, mechanic and <b>metallographic</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to assess the}} {{development}} of solid state joints of dissimilar material AA 1050 aluminum and AISI 304 stainless steel, which can be used in pipes of tanks of liquid propellants and other components of the Satellite Launch Vehicle. The joints were obtained by rotary friction welding process (RFW), which combines the heat generated from friction between two surfaces and plastic deformation. Tests were conducted with different welding process parameters. The results were analyzed by means of tensile <b>tests,</b> Vickers microhardness, <b>metallographic</b> <b>tests</b> and SEM-EDX. The strength of the joints varied with increasing friction time and the use of different pressure values. Joints were obtained with superior mechanical properties of the AA 1050 aluminum, with fracture occurring in the aluminum away from the bonding interface. The analysis by EDX at the interface of the junction showed that interdiffusion occurs between the main chemical components of the materials involved. The RFW proves to be a great method for obtaining joints between dissimilar materials, which is not possible by fusion welding processes...|$|R
