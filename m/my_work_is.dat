Of course, I disagree with those appraisals.|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage".

The last Nazi he had a hand in bringing to trial was Untersturmführer Julius Viel, who was convicted in 2001 of shooting seven Jewish prisoners. Cyla died on 10 November 2003, at age 95. Wiesenthal retired shortly afterward. [...] "I have survived them all. If there were any left, they'd be too old and weak to stand trial today. <b>My</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done," [...] said Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal died on 20 September 2005, at age 96, and was buried in Herzliya, Israel.|$|E

500|$|On September 18, Garfield asked A.F. Rockwell, a friend, if {{he would}} have a place in history. Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him. But his {{response}} was, [...] "No, <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done." [...] The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well, and went to sleep without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15 pm with great pain in his chest. The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious.

500|$|Kvinneakt was {{designed}} and created by Norman J. Taylor, a Seattle-based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington, between 1973 and 1975. The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full-length nude woman measuring 71" [...] x 38" [...] x 25". Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition. The works were purchased through a budget of $250,000; Kvinneakt was commissioned {{at a cost of}} $6,500. Funding sources for the project included Tri-Met (20percent) and the United States Department of Transportation (80percent). Of the 11 sculptures, only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough's (née Conchuratt) Cat in Repose were considered [...] "figurative". Claiming his intention was not to be vulgar, Taylor said: [...] "It's about grace and motion and a certain beauty and pride in the human figure. That may be sensual, but that's far different from sex." [...] According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, Taylor intended the piece to be [...] "confrontational"; he admitted, [...] "the worst reaction you could give <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> no reaction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} {{reproduce}} his subjects, Lichtenstein's work tackled {{the way in}} which the mass media portrays them. He would never take himself too seriously, however, saying: [...] "I think <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> different from comic strips -- but I wouldn't call it transformation; I don't think that whatever is meant by it is important to art." [...] When Lichtenstein's work was first exhibited, many art critics of the time challenged its originality. His work was harshly criticized as vulgar and empty. The title of a Life magazine article in 1964 asked, “Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?” Lichtenstein responded to such claims by offering responses such as the following: [...] "The closer <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> to the original, the more threatening and critical the content. However, <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think my paintings are critically transformed, but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument." [...] He discussed experiencing this heavy criticism in an interview with April Bernard and Mimi Thompson in 1986. Suggesting that it was at times difficult to be criticized, Lichtenstein said, “I don’t doubt when I’m actually painting, it’s the criticism that makes you wonder, it does.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Fairey's first {{art museum}} {{exhibition}}, titled Supply & Demand (as was his earlier book), {{was held in}} Boston at the Institute of Contemporary Art {{during the summer of}} 2009. The exhibition featured more than 250 works {{in a wide variety of}} media: screen prints, stencils, stickers, rubylith illustrations, collages, and works on wood, metal and canvas. As a complement to the ICA exhibition, Fairey created public art works around Boston.

All of these masters used their long careers to emphasize the importance of honesty in architectural expression. They saw this as a spiritual, but not dogmatic, quest that was inherent in every single building.” ...|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Beam {{was working}} with new {{techniques}} for incorporating photo-imagery into his work. He utilized a heat transfer technique learned from fellow artist Ann Beam, with his work on paper and Plexiglas. He also began working with photo emulsion and mixed media on paper and large scale canvas works. The works contained various juxtapositions of imagery from the spiritual, the natural, and political world, and incorporated his own poetic inscriptions and math equations. [...] "My works are like little puzzles, interesting little games. I {{play a game of}} dreaming ourselves as each other.

2500|$|Glenn Boyer's {{contributions}} to Wyatt Earp studies were widely regarded, but doubts raised by Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta seriously damaged his credibility. Author Gary Roberts, a Western historian, noted, “History is what’s suffered the most. It’s {{all kind of}} tragic really.” Allen Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, believes that I Married Wyatt Earp is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax. [...] Casey Tefertiller, a long-time critic of Boyer {{and the author of}} Wyatt Earp: The Life Behind the Legend, agreed. [...] "This may be the most remarkable literary hoax in American history. It has been believed and accepted as the words of Josephine Earp for twenty-three years now." [...] Tefertiller's book was {{one of the very few}} that didn't use any of Boyer's work as a source. Boyer commented, [...] "Writing about Earp and failing to mention me and <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> something like writing about Catholicism and neglecting to mention the Pope." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016, La Trobe University {{suspended}} Roz Ward, the British {{academic and}} activist who [...] "runs the Safe Schools Coalition" [...] through the university's Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society, for saying {{she wanted to}} get rid of the [...] "racist" [...] Australian flag and replace it with a red flag, [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done". Ward was also suspended from the Safe Schools program. The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Ward's actions [...] "underlined concerns many people had about how the program was managed". Ward's solicitors wrote to the university's Vice-Chancellor, John Dewar, urging him to withdraw all allegations and reinstate her by 10am Monday, otherwise legal action would ensue. While Dewar defended the University's actions, he reinstated Ward, with the Teachers Union saying Ward would be then able to resume supporting young people who are bullied. Beyondblue provided almost $600,000 to La Trobe University to administer the Safe Schools program. However, its chairman, Jeff Kennett, threatened to withdraw future funding and called for Ward to resign because of her [...] "extreme political views".|$|E

This kind of technology is strongly advancing. The main work consisted of setting up the structure for the navigation and designing both the portal and the local homepage for Prevas Karlstad.
