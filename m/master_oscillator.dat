2500|$|To {{ensure that}} {{the output of the}} beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a {{low-power}} flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an ytterbium-doped optical fiber laser known as the <b>Master</b> <b>Oscillator.</b> [...] The light from the <b>Master</b> <b>Oscillator</b> is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a neodymium glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the <b>Master</b> <b>Oscillator</b> to about 6joules. According to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>oscillator's</b> {{pitch is}} {{generated}} by user input (typically the synthesizer's keyboard), and is arbitrary. The slave oscillator's pitch may be tuned to (or detuned from) this frequency, or may remain constant. Every time the <b>master</b> <b>oscillator's</b> cycle repeats, the slave is retriggered, regardless of its position. If the slave is tuned to a lower frequency than the master it {{will be forced to}} repeat before it completes an entire cycle, and if it is tuned to a higher frequency it will be forced to repeat partway through a second or third cycle. This technique ensures that the oscillators are technically playing at the same frequency, but the irregular cycle of the slave oscillator often causes complex timbres and the impression of harmony.|$|R

2500|$|In May 2003, the NIF {{achieved}} [...] "first light" [...] on {{a bundle}} of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ pulse of IR light in a single beamline. In 2005 the first eight beams (a full bundle) were fired producing 153 kJ of infrared light, thus eclipsing OMEGA as the highest energy laser (per pulse) on the planet. By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the <b>Master</b> <b>Oscillator</b> Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed.

2500|$|After the {{amplification}} {{is complete}} {{the light is}} switched back into the beamline, where it runs {{to the far end}} of the building to the target chamber. The target chamber is a [...] multi-piece steel sphere weighing [...] Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the switchyard and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the <b>Master</b> <b>Oscillator</b> to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other. NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and switchyard system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more complex}} {{version of a}} Tesla coil, termed a [...] "magnifier" [...] by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core {{resonance}} [...] "driver" [...] transformer (or [...] "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the [...] "extra coil" [...] or simply the resonator) that has {{a large number of}} turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected {{to the bottom of the}} extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1" [...] diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to [...] "ring up" [...] to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning [...] "modes" [...] are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the <b>master</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E

50|$|On {{board the}} aircraft, the {{signals from the}} three {{stations}} were received {{and sent to the}} 'A-type' display. A local oscillator of much less complexity than the one at the master station was used to trigger the display sweep, and when first activated it would be unlikely to have exactly the same timing as the master station.

40|$|A {{solid-state}} {{source of}} long pulse length, sodium-resonance radiation {{was developed for}} the purpose of generating an artificial star in the earth's mesospheric sodium layer.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether the daily rhythms of locomotor activity and behavioural thermoregulation that have previously {{been observed in}} Australian sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) under field conditions are true circadian rhythms that persist in constant darkness (DD) and whether these rhythms show similar characteristics. Lizards held on laboratory thermal gradients in the Australian spring under the prevailing 12 -hour light : dark (LD) cycle for 14 days displayed robust daily rhythms of behavioural thermoregulation and locomotor activity. In the 13 -day period of DD that followed LD, most lizards exhibited free-running circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and behavioural thermoregulation. The predominant activity pattern displayed in LD was unimodal and this was retained in DD. While mean levels of skin temperature and locomotor activity were found to decrease from LD to DD, activity duration remained unchanged. The present results demonstrate {{for the first time}} that this species’ daily rhythm of locomotor activity is an endogenous circadian rhythm. Our results also demonstrate a close correlation between the circadian activity and thermoregulatory rhythms in this species indicating that the two rhythms are controlled by the same <b>master</b> <b>oscillator(s).</b> Future examination of seasonal aspects of these rhythms, may, however, cause this hypothesis to be modified.
