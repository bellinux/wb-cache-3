50|$|Because most oceanographic {{activity}} in Canada is federally funded, the cutbacks of 1985 affected scientific {{research in this}} field. For example, the Pacific Ocean research facilities of the Defence Research Board were closed. However, in spite of this, the Bedford Institute of Oceanography has maintained its status as Canada's premier oceanographic institution. Consolidation {{over the years has}} brought the oceanographic activities of four departments under the roof of the Institute, and at the present time, over 400 scientists, engineers, technicians, support staff and others conduct targeted research in a number of fields. National Defence activities support ocean surveillance through the Maritime Forces Atlantic's Route Survey Office and focus on surveys of the sea floor in areas of military interest. The Shellfish Section of Environment Canada conducts ocean water quality surveys and microbiological studies of shellfish. The Geological Survey of Canada is also present and has established itself as Canada's principal <b>marine</b> <b>geoscience</b> facility with emphasis on geophysics, geochemistry, marine and petroleum geology and the coastal/off-shore landmass.

50|$|The Geological Survey has {{continued}} its research during this period. In 1986, the Survey {{merged with the}} Earth Physics Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and acquired the national seismology and geomagnetic observatory networks of that organization. In the nineties, this new organization {{took the lead in}} the development of the National Geoscience Mapping Program (NATMAP) with other governments, universities and industries to optimize the use of funding for the new mapping of bedrock and surface geology of Canada. Activity in environmental studies has involved establishing norms for the geochemical profiles of naturally occurring substances and work with respect to climate change as well as hydrogeology and natural radioactivity and the risks associated with natural dangers, including earthquakes and tsunamis. The Intergovernmental Geoscience Accord, signed in 1996, clarified the role of the Survey with respect to relations with provincial and territorial governments. As the result of a reorganization, the Survey became part of the Earth Sciences division of Natural Resources Canada in the mid-nineties. In recent years, the evolution of digital electronics and the Internet has seen the Survey undertake the development of the Geoscience Knowledge Network with the aim of making geological information available online. The budget of the Survey is now about $60 million a year, and the staff of 550 are located at headquarters in Ottawa and regional offices in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, St. Foy, Quebec, Calgary, Alberta and Sidney and Vancouver, British Columbia.

40|$|Sea-level rise {{is often}} {{identified}} as the principal driver of shoreline recession, but on drift-aligned coasts wave climate variability can be a more important driver of shoreline stability through its control on longshore sand transport between compartments. Significant variability in the mean and storm wave climates along the south-eastern Australian coast, occurs on annual to decadal time scales. Wave climate shifts result in switching of sand transport paths on the shoreface and alongshore via headland bypassing, resulting in shoreline rotation. We use wave climate hindcasting, shoreface bathymetric change, and <b>marine</b> <b>geoscience</b> investigations to illuminate sand supply and transport processes for sections of the eastern Australian coast, over the past 120 years and 2, 000 years. The centennial scale coastal evolution highlights {{the sensitivity of the}} east Australian coast to changes in wave climate and sand supply.

40|$|Fugro-McClelland <b>Marine</b> <b>Geosciences</b> Inc. ’s piezoprobe, a penetrationbased tool used to {{determine}} pore pressure and hydrologic properties within a borehole, was deployed {{for the first time}} in the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) on ODP Leg 204 in July 2002. Analysis of the piezoprobe data suggests that in situ pore pressure is 9. 5 MPa, which is approximately the hydrostatic pressure (9. 53 MPa). The piezoprobe deployment and modeling of the results provides one of the first measurements of in situ permeability made within the borehole. From the piezoprobe dissipation data, we estimate in situ permeability of approximately 1. 5 ´ 10 - 17 m 2 for the hemipelagic clay. This is consistent with laboratory-measured permeability (~ 1 x 10 – 17 m 2) on hemipelagic clay samples from nearby ODP Site 892. The piezoprobe results were compared to a Davis-Villinger Temperature/Pressure Probe (DVTP-P) measurement made at the same depth, and in the same lithology, but in an adjacent borehole. The DVTP- P is also a penetration-based tool, however it has a much wider probe diameter. The DVTP-P generated a higher peak pressure that did not dissipate as much as the piezoprobe pressure, which resulted in a DVTP-P estimate of in situ pressure that nearly equals the overburden stress. The results suggest that a narrow diameter probe like the piezoprobe can be used to rapidly determine in situ pressure and hydrologic properties in sites investigated by the Ocean Drilling Program.

40|$|Significant {{variability}} in the modality of mean and storm wave climates along the south-eastern Australian coast, has been observed on annual to decadal time scales. On longer timescales of interest to marine geologists, wave climate shifts result in switching of sand transport paths on the lower shoreface and alongshore via headland bypassing. Using a novel approach we use wave climate hindcasting and <b>marine</b> <b>geoscience</b> investigations to illuminate sand supply and transport processes for sections of the eastern Australian coast. The problem is approached through the combined analysis of shoreface bathymetric change and related nearshore, shoreline and spit behaviour, over a 119 year period, together with wave climate variability associated with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). A rotation in the seabed bathymetry is interpreted {{as a response to}} multidecadal processes, including: a rotation in the dominant deepwater south-easterly wave power from 120 - 140 to 140 - 160 and changes in modality between La Nina-like to El Nino-like phases of the IPO; and, associated changes in across-shoreface and headland bypassing longshore sand transport. The shift from unimodal mean and storm wave climate in the 1800 's to bimodalilty in the 1900 's is associated with large scale changes in the windfield over the Tasman Sea. Centennial scale processes can delay dynamic equilibrium over the shoreface, and our results can be applied to understanding Late Holocene shoreface evolution. 1 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to unravel}} the {{ecological}} and evolutionary dynamics within the calcareous nannofossil communities at the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) transition and during the Oligocene time when Cenozoic 'icehouse' conditions were established. The main question this study aims to answer is whether {{the changes in the}} nannofossil assemblages were controlled by intrinsic evolutionary trends or if the changes were controlled by environmental factors such as changes in temperature and nutrient availability in the surface water. These questions are addressed with detailed analyses of the taxonomy, biostratigraphy and fluctuations in abundance and diversity of calcareous nannofossil assemblages from a continuous latest Eocene through Oligocene sediment section from the ODP Site 1218 (8 ° 53. 38 ´N, 135 ° 22. 00 ´W), paleo-equatorial Pacific Ocean. An improved nannofossil taxonomy and biostratigraphy has been established. At the E/O transition, changes in the nannofossil preservation mimics changes in calcium carbonate content. A detailed investigation of late Eocene and Oligocene sediments yields age estimates for ten nannofossil bioevents. Morphometric studies of the Reticulofenestra umbilicus-R. hillae show that these cannot be subdivided into two different morphospecies. Based on different morphometry and stratigraphic ranges, the Oligocene Sphenolithus lineage appears {{to be the result of}} a combined anagenetic and cladogenetic evolution. A new nannolith species is described: Triquetrorhabdulus longus. High-resolution nannofossil data indicate changes in the composition, abundance and diversity of the mid-Oligocene assemblages. Intervals of high diversity index coincide with Oi-glaciation events. However, visual examination of the variations in abundance of nannofossil taxa do not appear to correlate with changes in either oxygen or carbon isotopes. This presumably indicates that a dynamic equilibrium did not exist between these Oligocene nannoplankton assemblages and changes in surface water temperature or productivity conditions.  Doctoral Thesis in <b>Marine</b> <b>Geoscience</b> at Stockholm University, Sweden 200...|$|E
