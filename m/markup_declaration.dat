40|$|The {{purpose of}} COVAX (Contemporary Culture Virtual Archives in XML) {{financed by the}} European Commission in IST Programme was to analyse and draw up the {{technical}} solutions required to provide access through the Internet to homogeneously-encoded document descriptions of archive, library and museum collections based on the application of XML. The project demonstrated its feasibility through a prototype containing a meaningful sample of all {{the different types of}} documents to build a global system for search and retrieval. The aim {{of this paper is to}} create in the COVAX system a new presentation of the documents. A system capable of processing <b>markup</b> semantics <b>declarations</b> can act as an interactive environment for testing conjectures and validating hypotheses. Semantics is one of the ways of improving information retrieval performances; we will explore this problem in the COVAX case study. We will investigate the possibility to derive a semantic knowledge from COVAX repositories, in order to improve the site analysis process and the query answering process. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} unique renaming declarations and references in Java programs using source transformation to XML <b>markup.</b> Each entity <b>declaration</b> and reference in the Java program is assigned a globally unique identifier (UID) based on its declaration scope and file. The UID serves as a key by which the entity's original declaration and all references can be found, and more importantly, by which information about the entity can be stored or retrieved from the design database. The resulting uniquely renamed source code makes it convenient and efficient to do further business logic and technical analysis that crosses the boundary between source code and the design database. UIDs are attached to entity references in the source code using XML markup, so that both the UID and the original source text of the declaration or reference {{are available in the}} renamed source program. While it is possible to generate unique names in an ad hoc manner, we show how to generate them using a combination of source transformations and design database inferences. This ensures that the notion of UID is consistent and well defined...|$|R
