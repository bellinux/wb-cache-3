25|$|Prestel was a British information-retrieval {{system based}} on {{teletext}} protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using a modem and the phone system to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's <b>Minitel.</b> The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, {{in contrast to the}} TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} for {{the modern}} home loan banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred {{to the use of}} a terminal, keyboard and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank. Online services started in New York in 1981 when four of the city's major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover) offered home banking services. using the videotex system. Because of the commercial failure of videotex these banking services never became popular except in France where the use of videotex (<b>Minitel)</b> was subsidised by the telecom provider and the UK, where the Prestel system was used.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and <b>Minitel</b> (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 {{changed its name to}} America Online, and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh. Q-Link was {{a modified version of the}} PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.|$|E
40|$|A {{sentinel}} {{health information}} system using telematics {{and a network}} of general practitioners {{was set up in}} Aquitaine in south western France in 1986. Among the health problems under surveillance was acute diarrhoea. Data for each patient who fulfilled the usual case definition for acute diarrhoea were reported by general practitioners using home terminals (<b>Minitels)</b> connected to a central computer by telephone. Over one year 2234 cases of diarrhoea were reported, the incidence varying from 0. 8 to 1. 5 cases per doctor per week. Seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with peaks in the winter and in the summer. Only 379 (17 %) episodes of diarrhoea were classified as severe, and these patients consulted their general practitioners earlier than patients whose diarrhoea was less severe. Foreign travel was rarely found in the patients' histories, but clusters of cases were found in communities (4. 6 %) and in families (22. 3 %). The advantages of this system were easy reporting and immediate feedback, but it was difficult to extrapolate the data, and the system was inadequate for intervening in outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease. Our knowledge of diarrhoeal diseases in south west France improved...|$|R

50|$|In some European countries, and {{especially}} in France, <b>Minitel</b> data transmitting services were popular before the Internet. <b>Minitel</b> had many consumer-level communication services, including chatting, email, railway and broadcast timetables and travel and hotel booking. <b>Minitel</b> used little terminals rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept <b>Minitel</b> transmission protocol speed. Amiga <b>Minitel</b> communication programs were written in France, Germany and Italy (Amiga Videotel).|$|E
50|$|<b>Minitel</b> {{sales in}} the late 1990s {{accounted}} for almost 15% of sales at La Redoute and 3 Suisses, France's biggest mail order companies. In 2005, the most popular <b>Minitel</b> application was Teleroute, the online real-time freight exchange, which accounted for nearly 8% of <b>Minitel</b> usage.|$|E
50|$|Micronet 800 {{was quite}} similar in scope to, and {{compatible}} with, the German Bildschirmtext and French <b>Minitel</b> services, but <b>Minitel</b> achieved volume sales for its terminals {{by the simple}} expedient of replacing paper telephone books with their terminals. Based on its success, <b>Minitel</b> proved resilient against the Internet adoption in France.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Minitel</b> {{used the}} {{existing}} Transpac network for commercial users; its popularity caused problems for its existing commercial users. After a severe disruption in June 1985, France Télécom divided business and <b>Minitel</b> traffic. When connecting, the <b>Minitel</b> integrated modem generally dialed a special number connecting to a PAVI (Point d'Accès VIdéotexte, [...] "videotext access point"). The PAVI transmitted {{information to the}} servers of the appropriate company or administration using Transpac.|$|E
50|$|France Télécom charged <b>Minitel</b> users {{at rates}} {{of up to}} €1 a minute on their monthly {{telephone}} bill. The rates depended on the service called; most services were far cheaper than this maximum. It then paid back part of the sum to the companies operating <b>Minitel</b> servers.|$|E

50|$|The {{extent to}} which <b>Minitel</b> {{enhanced}} or hindered {{the development of the}} Internet in France is widely debated. On the one hand, it included more than a thousand services, some of which predicted common applications on the modern Internet. For example, in 1986, French university students coordinated a national strike using <b>Minitel,</b> demonstrating an early use of digital communication devices for participatory technopolitical ends. Alternatively, the French government's attachment to the natively developed <b>Minitel</b> may have slowed the adoption of the Internet in France; there were still 810,000 terminals in the country in 2012, and in the 1990s there was a peak of nine million terminals.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 France Télécom earned 620 million francs (approximately $70 million) from <b>Minitel.</b> 2,000 private {{companies}} earned 289 million francs (about $35 million) during the year; Libération earned 2.5 million francs (about $300,000) {{from the service}} in September.

5000|$|<b>Minitel</b> used a {{half-duplex}} asymmetric {{data transmission}} via its modem. It downlinked at 1200 bit/s and uplinked at 75 bit/s. This allowed fast downloads, for the time. The system, {{which came to}} be known as [...] "1275" [...] was more correctly known as V.23. This system had been developed for general-purpose data communications, but was most commonly used for <b>Minitel</b> and equivalent services around the world.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the demise of}} the British system, the French equivalent of Prestel, Teletel/Minitel, received substantial public backing when millions of <b>Minitel</b> terminals were handed out free to telephone subscribers (causing Alcatel huge financial problems). As a consequence the Teletel network became very popular in France, and remained well used, with access later also possible over the Internet. After a short postponement, <b>Minitel</b> closed finally on 30 June 2012.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{standards}} were also introduced for special purposes, commonly using a high-speed channel for receiving, and a lower-speed channel for sending. One typical example {{was used in}} the French <b>Minitel</b> system, in which the user's terminals spent the majority of their time receiving information. The modem in the <b>Minitel</b> terminal thus operated at 1,200 bit/s for reception, and 75 bit/s for sending commands back to the servers.|$|E
