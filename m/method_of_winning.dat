The game also introduces the ability for multiple characters to fight one another at once, ranging from a 3-on-3 match to a 4-way brawl. Most noticeably, the game does away with the shop feature, and unlockables are now acquired by simply meeting certain criteria in the game's new Mission mode.

50|$|Armed force, or {{the threat}} thereof, was {{sometimes}} used to gain European sovereignty over Oceanic nations. One {{example of this}} was the 'Bayonet Constitution' of Hawaii. This {{was not the only}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> sovereignty. In some cases a treaty was peacefully agreed to, but even in these cases violence or the fear of it was often still a factor. For example, New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi was presented to Māori partly as a way to prevent a French invasion and partly as a way to stop intertribal warfare; while Tonga became a British protected state {{as a result of an}} attempt to oust the Tongan king. In other parts of the region, such as Australia, European sovereignty was simply proclaimed without any attempt to win the consent of the indigenous peoples. In many cases, including those in which sovereignty had been ceded more or less voluntarily, force and the threat of force were required to maintain European dominance.|$|E

60|$|While {{both the}} verse and the prose of Burns are revelations, his letters reveal {{more than his}} poems the failings and frailties of the man.

His letters, on the other hand, present him to us less frequently on those commanding altitudes.

5000|$|During the Middle Ages {{military}} forces used combined arms as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> battles and furthering a war leader or king’s long term goals. Some historians claim {{that during the}} Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat “as a general military engagement.” [...] In {{the pursuit of a}} leader's goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops.|$|E
