5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and <b>motor</b> <b>fuel.</b> The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. The North Korea Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to completely halt military rail transport. Ammunition and <b>motor</b> <b>fuel,</b> which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and <b>motor</b> <b>fuel,</b> which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>fuel</b> (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel,</b> each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, a Road Board {{was set up}} {{to improve}} roads. It was {{initially}} funded by a tax on <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> and a later a licence duty on cars, the Road Fund.

The Road Board was abolished in 1919 when its functions were transferred to the newly established Ministry of Transport. In 1922, after the foundation of the Irish Free State, the Minister for Local Government took over the functions of the Ministry of Transport. In 2002, the newly renamed Department of Transport took over responsibility for national roads. From 1921-1922 onwards, the partition of Ireland has led to different paths in the evolution of public road networks in Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland. Responsibility for roads in Northern Ireland fell on the Stormont administration from 1921 to 1972. In 1996, the Northern Ireland Roads Service was set up; it became an agency of the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development when devolved government was restored in 1999.|$|E

500|$|A major {{restriction}} hampering {{sales of}} E85 flex vehicles, or fueling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 {{to the public}} with only 2% of the <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> stations offering E85 by March 2014. , there were only 3,218 fueling stations selling E85 {{to the public in}} the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> outlets do not offer any ethanol blend. In addition, there has been a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of [...] for each dedicated ethanol tank. The Obama Administration set the goal of installing 10,000 blender pumps nationwide until 2015, and to support this target the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a rule in May 2011 to include flexible fuel pumps in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP).

500|$|The roads {{maintained}} by DelDOT include Interstate Highways, other freeways, arterial roads, collector roads, and local roads serving both {{urban and rural}} areas. Delaware has a total of [...] of freeway {{considered part of the}} Interstate Highway System. Non-Interstate freeways in the state include the portion of DE 1 between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana, the section of DE 141 between south of Newport and Prices Corner, and the Puncheon Run Connector that links US 13 and DE 1 in Dover. Two toll roads exist in the state. A mainline toll plaza is located along the Delaware Turnpike portion of I-95 near the Maryland border in Newark. Tolls are also collected along the DE 1 freeway, with mainline toll plazas at Dover and Biddles Corner and ramp tolls at North Dover, South Smyrna, and Boyds Corner. Tolls along I-95 and DE 1 may be paid with cash or an electronic toll collection system known as E-ZPass. The DRBA also collects tolls for the Delaware Memorial Bridge for motorists entering Delaware from New Jersey using cash or E-ZPass. Highways and other transportation projects in Delaware are funded through both the Transportation Trust Fund and the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The Transportation Trust Fund receives revenue from tolls along I-95 and DE 1, <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes of 23 cents per gallon on gasoline and 22 cents per gallon on special fuels, motor vehicle document and registration fees, and DMV fees.
