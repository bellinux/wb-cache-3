Bottom-up {{segmentation}} methods merge similar neighboring regions {{according to}} a decision rule and a <b>merging</b> <b>order.</b> In this paper, we propose a contribution {{for each of these}} two points. Firstly, under statistical hypothesis of similarity, we provide an improved decision rule for region merging based on significance tests and the recent statistical inequality of McDiarmid. Secondly, we propose a dynamic <b>merging</b> <b>order</b> based on our merging predicate. This last heuristic is justified by considering an energy minimisation framework.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>merging</b> <b>ordered</b> sets {{in the least}} number of binary {{comparisons}} has been solved completely {{only for a few}} special cases. When the sets to be merged are of size m and n (m ⩽ n ⩽ m + 4) the tape merge algorithm {{has been shown to be}} optimum in the worst case. This paper significantly extends these results by showing that the tape merge algorithm is optimum in the worst case whenever one set is no larger than 1. 5 times the size of the other. This result is obtained by defining an interesting and amusing two-player game isomorphic to the problem of <b>merging</b> <b>ordered</b> sets and analyzing the optimum strategies for each player.

40|$|Abstract—Agent {{technologies}} {{represent a}} promising approach for {{the integration of}} interorganizational capabilities across distributed, networked environments. However, knowledge sharing interoperability problems can arise when agents incorporating differing ontologies try to synchronize their internal information. Moreover, in practice, agents {{may not have a}} common or global consensus ontology that will facilitate knowledge sharing and integration of functional capabilities. We propose a method to enable agents to develop a local consensus ontology during operation time as needed. By identifying similarities in the ontologies of their peer agents, a set of agents can discover new concepts/relations and integrate them into a local consensus ontology on demand. We evaluate this method, both syntactically and semantically, when forming local consensus ontologies with and without the use of a lexical database. We also report on the effects when several factors, such as the similarity measure, the relation search level depth, and the <b>merge</b> <b>order,</b> are varied. Finally, experimenting in the domain of agent-supported Web service composition, we demonstrate how our method allows us to successfully autonomously form service-oriented local consensus ontologies.

40|$|International audienceHyperspectral imaging {{segmentation}} {{has been}} an active research area {{over the past few}} years. Despite the growing interest, some factors such as high spectrum variability are still significant issues. In this work, we propose to deal with segmentation through the use of Binary Partition Trees (BPTs). BPTs are suggested as a new representation of hyperspectral data representation generated by a merging process. Different hyperspectral region models and similarity metrics defining the <b>merging</b> <b>orders</b> are presented and analyzed. The resulting merging sequence is stored in a BPT structure which enables image regions to be represented at different resolution levels. The segmentation is performed through an intelligent pruning of the BPT, that selects regions to form the final partition. Experimental results on two hyperspectral data sets have allowed us to compare different <b>merging</b> <b>orders</b> and pruning strategies demonstrating the encouraging performances of BPT-based representation...|$|R

Introduction Connected operators [5, 2, 4] are becoming popular because they simplify images without corrupting the shape information. It has been shown [8] that they interact with the image by merging the zones of the space where the signal is constant (called flat zones). As a result, they do not introduce new contours. These filters are extensively used in image analysis and segmentation applications [10, 3, 6, 1]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} the current work is to propose, under a {{statistical}} framework, a family of unsupervised region merging techniques providing a set of the most relevant region-based explanations of an image at different levels of analysis. These techniques are characterized by general and nonparametric region models, with neither color nor texture homogeneity assumptions, and a set of innovative merging criteria, based on information theory statistical measures. The scale consistency of the partitions is assured through i) a size regularization term into the merging criteria and a classical <b>merging</b> <b>order,</b> or ii) using a novel scale-based <b>merging</b> <b>order</b> to avoid the region size homogeneity imposed by the use of a size regularization term. Moreover, a partition significance index is defined to automatically determine the subset of most representative partitions from the created hierarchy. Most significant automatically extracted partitions show the ability to represent the semantic content of the image from a human point of view. Finally, a complete and exhaustive evaluation of the proposed techniques is performed, using not only different databases for the two main addressed problems (object-oriented segmentation of generic images and texture image segmentation), but also specific evaluation features in each case: under- and oversegmentation error, and a large set of region-based, pixel-based and error consistency indicators, respectively. Results are promising, outperforming in most indicators both object-oriented and texture state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the automatic image segmentation {{problem in a}} region merging style. With an initially over-segmented image, in which the many regions (or super-pixels) with homogeneous color are detected, image segmentation is performed by iteratively merging the regions according to a statistical test. There are two essential issues in a region <b>merging</b> algorithm: <b>order</b> of <b>merging</b> and the stopping criterion. In the proposed algorithm, these two issues are solved by a novel predicate, which {{is defined by the}} sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and the minimal cost criterion. Starting from an over-segmented image, neighboring regions are progressively merged if there is an evidence for merging according to this predicate. We show that the <b>merging</b> <b>order</b> follows the principle of dynamic programming. This formulates image segmentation as an inference problem, where the final segmentation is established based on the observed image. We also prove that the produced segmentation satisfies certain global properties. In addition, a faster algorithm is developed to accelerate the region merging process, which maintains a nearest neighbor graph (NNG) in each iteration. Experiments on real natural images are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed dynamic region merging algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Standard {{analysis}} on recursive data structures restrict {{their attention to}} shape properties (for instance, a program that manipulates a list returns a list), excluding properties that deal with the actual content of these structures. For instance, these analysis would not establish that the result of <b>merging</b> two <b>ordered</b> lists is an ordered list. Separation logic, one of the prominent framework for these kind of analysis, proposed a heap model that could represent data, but, to our knowledge, no predicate dealing with data has ever been integrated to the logic while preserving decidability. We establish decidability for (rst-order) separation logic with a predicate that allows to compare two successive data in a list. We then consider the extension where two data in arbitrary positions may be compared, and establish the undecidability in general. We de ne a guarded fragment {{that turns out to}} be both decidable and su ciently expressive to prove the preservation of the loop invariant of a standard program <b>merging</b> <b>ordered</b> lists. We nally consider the extension with the magic-wand and prove that, by constrast with the data-free case, even a very restricted use of the magic wand already introduces undecidability. ...|$|R
