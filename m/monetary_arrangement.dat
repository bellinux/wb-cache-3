We see this in long historical data and in panel data for the three episodes – the classical gold-standard period, the interwar period and the varied monetary regimes of the post-WWII era. Low frequency movements of exchange rates and relative price levels are highly correlated and more often than not bear a close to one-to-one relation to one another. Price-level behavior across countries differs in the way that PPP suggests when <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> differ and is highly similar when <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> are themselves similar...|$|R

40|$|Feasibility of a currency board type of <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> in {{transitional}} {{economies of}} Eastern Europe is a function {{of the size}} of the country and the nature of the financial sector in a country. For very small countries where financial services can be provided by subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions the currency board is likely to be an optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, if the need exists for an efficient domestically based financial sector - as is likely in medium and large countries - the currency board type of arrangement appears unfeasible. Major reason is the need to restructure the domestic financial system in these countries. Such restructuring is costly and unlikely to be paid out of fiscal revenues. Hence, the need for Central Bank with its ability to create "net domestic assets" as the restructuring agent. However, once the transition is concluded and East European countries accession to EU becomes a serious possibility, a currency board arrangement appears to be a best intermediate monetary step before joining the Euro area. currency board, transitional economies, <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement,</b> accession to European Union...|$|E

We find that ASEAN today is less suitable for a regional <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> than the euro area was before the Maastricht Treaty, but the differences are not large. On the political front, we analyse the prerequisites for monetary integration in light of 50 years of European experience. We conclude that a firm political commitment would be the key to ensuring that an attempt to form a regional <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not viewed as simply another fixed exchange rate system open to speculative attack. That commitment would have to be strong enough to survive for an extended period and to support difficult decisions such as rendering the central bank independent, adhering to fiscal and exchange rate arrangements even if the policy stance conflicts with that which would be adopted on the basis of purely domestic considerations, and accepting supranational directives. These are very considerable prerequisites for success. ASEAN; Optimum Currency Areas; Single Currency...|$|E

40|$|Former Title : Economic {{development}} & policy seriesFormer No. : EDP 06 - 10 Public debt stabilization {{has been}} considered important in the recent trend of institutional reforms of monetary arrangements in emerging economies. One crucial issue separating emerging from developed economies is that emerging economies often face serious inefficiency associated with tax collection, such as corruption, reducing the capability of controlling the primary budget balance {{as well as the}} entire public debt. This paper studies the relationship between tax-related inefficiency and public debt stabilization under two designs of monetary policies: inflation targeting and discretionary monetary arrangements. The result is that such inefficiency not only induces a higher level of public debt in the steady state but also reduces the adjustment speed for public debt stabilization, irrespective of monetary arrangements. This study also shows that the discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> enhances the adjustment speed for public debt more effectively, but which <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> is more effective in reducing the long-run level of public debt is highly dependent on the degree of tax-related inefficiency. In particular, the discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> could induce a higher level of public debt compared to the inflation targeting arrangement when the degree of tax-related inefficiency is either small or large enough...|$|E

The Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy, by many aspects a forerunner of Euroland, improved trade between member states by a factor of 3. Other arrangements, such as the gold standard and the Scandinavian union also impacted trade favourably. To explain this, we argue that monetary coordination, by fostering the correlation of business cycles compensate the adverse effect that the current account constraint has on trade integration. This is found to vastly compensate the negative consequences that trade integration might have on the symmetry of shocks, of which this Paper finds strong evidence, in contrast with recent empirical work. 19 th century; endogeneity; europe; gravity equations; monetary unions; optimum currency area; trade and business cycles correlation...|$|R
