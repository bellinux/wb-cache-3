40|$|A {{primary source}} of {{spacecraft}} jitter is due to <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> within momentum exchange devices (MEDs) used for fine pointing, such as reaction wheels (RWs) and variable-speed control moment gyroscopes (VSCMGs). Although these effects are often characterized through experimentation in order to validate pointing stability requirements, it is of interest to include jitter in a computer simulation of the spacecraft {{in the early stages}} of spacecraft development. An estimate of jitter amplitude may be found by modeling MED imbalance torques as external disturbance forces and torques on the spacecraft. In this case, MED <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> are lumped into static and dynamic imbalance parameters, allowing jitter force and torque to be simply proportional to wheel speed squared. A physically realistic dynamic model may be obtained by defining <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> in terms of a wheel center of mass location and inertia tensor. The fully-coupled dynamic model allows for momentum and energy validation of the system. This is often critical when modeling additional complex dynamical behavior such as flexible dynamics and fuel slosh. Furthermore, it is necessary to use the fully-coupled model in instances where the relative mass properties of the spacecraft with respect to the RWs cause the simplified jitter model to be inaccurate. This thesis presents a generalized approach to MED imbalance modeling of a rigid spacecraft hub with N RWs or VSCMGs. A discussion is included to convert from manufacturer specifications of RW imbalances to the parameters introduced within each model. Implementations of the fully-coupled RW and VSCMG models derived within this thesis are released open-source as part of the Basilisk astrodynamics software...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of the {{rotating}} shallow water equations, it is shown how initially unbalanced states possessing certain symmetries dynamically evolve to lose those symmetries during nonlinear geostrophic adjustment. Using conservation law methods, it is demonstrated that the adjustment of equal and opposite (circular) <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> results in a balanced end state where cyclones are stronger than anticyclones; the reverse holds true for momentum imbalances. In both cases, the degree of this asymmetry is shown to be directly proportional to the amount of initial imbalance (a measure of the nonlinearity occurring during time-dependent adjustment). On the other hand, the degree of asymmetry is maximal for imbalances of Rossby deformation scale. As for the potential vorticity, it is shown that its final profile can be noticeably different from its initial one; from an Eulerian perspective, this rearrangement is not confined to uniform shifts of potential vorticity fronts. Direct 2 D numerical initial value problems confirm the asymmetry in the predicted final states and establish a relatively fast time scale for adjustment to complete. The robustness of these results is confirmed by studying, in addition, the adjustment of elliptical <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances.</b> The numerical integrations reveal that, during geostrophic adjustment, potential vorticity rearrangement occurs irreversibly on a fast wave time scale...|$|R

A static <b>mass</b> <b>imbalance</b> identification method without using the closed-loop transfer function is proposed in this paper. Then the null displacement control of the magnetically suspended rotor is realized by using the identified static <b>mass</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Because null vibration is the control target for the rotor of a magnetically suspended control moment gyro (MSCMG) with active-passive magnetic bearings, a null vibration control method depending on the displacement stiffness is introduced. However, the displacement stiffness of the passive magnetic bearing is hard to obtain accurately. Therefore, the least mean square method is utilized to adjust the uncertain displacement stiffness adaptively according to the centroid acceleration. Simulation results show that adaptive null vibration control based on the static <b>mass</b> <b>imbalance</b> identification can remove the synchronous magnetic bearing force effectively, thus enabling the rotor of the MSCMG with active-passive magnetic bearings to rotate about its initial axis.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>mass</b> <b>imbalanced</b> Fermi-Fermi mixture within the {{framework}} of a two-dimensional lattice fermion model. Based on the thermodynamic and species dependent quasiparticle behavior we map out the finite temperature phase diagram of this system and show that unlike the balanced Fermi superfluid there are now two different pseudogap regimes as PG-I and PG-II. While within the PG-I regime both the fermionic species are pseudogapped, PG-II corresponds to the regime where pseudogap feature survives only in the light species. We believe that the single particle spectral features that we discuss in this paper are observable through the species resolved radio frequency spectroscopy and momentum resolved photo emission spectroscopy measurements on systems such as, 6 $_{Li}$- 40 $_{K}$ mixture. We further investigate the interplay between the population and <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> and report that at a fixed population imbalance the BCS-BEC crossover in a Fermi-Fermi mixture would require a critical interaction (U$_{c}$), for the realization of the uniform superfluid state. The effect of <b>imbalance</b> in <b>mass</b> on the exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase has been probed in detail in terms of the thermodynamic and quasiparticle behavior of this phase.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop the {{theoretical}} {{study of a}} novel physical system, {{in the context of}} ultracold gases. We investigate the physical behavior of a resonant Bose-Fermi mix- ture, namely, an ultracold gas made of both bosons and fermions, with a strong attractive interaction between these two components. We study homogeneous density and <b>mass</b> <b>imbalanced</b> mixtures from weak- to strong- coupling limit, comparing the results obtained with two different theoretical approaches, a many-body diagrammatic approach (the T- matrix approximation) and Quantum Monte Carlo method. By using many-body diagrammatic methods we first obtain the finite-temperature phase diagram and the thermodynamic properties of the system. We observe the presence of a quantum phase transition from the condensed (superfluid) to the normal (molecular) phase. Developing the zero-temperature limit of the same Green’s function formalism we study the effect of density and <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances</b> for the Bose-Fermi mixture. For a van- ishingly small boson density we derive the asymptotic expressions for the critical coupling in the limits of small and large mass ratios. These expressions are relevant also for the polaron-molecule transition in a strongly-imbalanced Fermi mixture, thus bridging two quite distinct physical systems. The analysis of the momentum distribution functions at sufficiently large density imbalances shows an interesting effect in the bosonic momentum distribution, due to the simultaneous presence of composite fermions and unpaired bosons. By using the corresponding retarded propagators we calculate the spectral weight func- tions and the dispersions of the bosons and of the fermions. We obtain a wide collection of single-particle intensity plots, for several values of the density and <b>mass</b> <b>imbalances,</b> which could be compared in the near future with experimental data, obtained e. g. with radio-frequency spectroscopy.

Two different nodal surfaces are used as trial wave functions in the two regimes.

By fitting the Quantum Monte Carlo data, we can write the expressions for the energy in the superfluid and in the normal phase. A phase diagram in the coupling and boson-fermion concentration variables is then derived and the occurrence of phase separation is discussed.
