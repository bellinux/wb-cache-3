5|$|In 1992, Israeli {{helicopters}} {{attacked a}} <b>motorcade</b> in southern Lebanon, killing the Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi, his wife, son, and four others.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} <b>motorcade</b> {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street {{intersection}} because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the <b>motorcade,</b> Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the <b>motorcade</b> into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian <b>motorcade</b> {{consisting}} of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the <b>motorcade</b> through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the <b>motorcade</b> would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Motorcades</b> {{involving}} the presidential state car are detailed, involved operations. <b>Motorcades</b> under President George W. Bush involved {{up to two}} dozen cars; under President Barack Obama they constituted thirty to forty-five other vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|On the Monday {{before the}} election, {{there was an}} {{incident}} when <b>motorcades</b> for the two main parties collided with each other. No major injuries resulted and rallies for each party were held afterwards. The police then refused either party permission to hold <b>motorcades</b> {{on the day before}} the election.|$|R

5|$|Viktor Ilyin, a disenfranchised Soviet soldier, {{attempted}} to assassinate Brezhnev on 22 January 1969 by firing shots at a <b>motorcade</b> carrying Brezhnev through Moscow. Though Brezhnev was unhurt, the shots killed a driver and lightly injured several celebrated cosmonauts of the Soviet space programme {{who were also}} travelling in the <b>motorcade.</b> Brezhnev's attacker was captured, and interrogated personally by Andropov, then KGB chairman and future Soviet leader. Ilyin was not given the death penalty because his desire to kill Brezhnev was considered so absurd that {{he was sent to}} the Kazan mental asylum instead for treatment.|$|E
5|$|About {{five hours}} after the {{aircraft}} departed Andrews, it touched down at Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, California. The public, including sailors from the USS Ronald Reagan, was there to witness the plane's arrival.

5|$|Grant was on {{assignment}} in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas.

He was named {{as one of}} the five Western Australian Sportspeople of the Year in recognition of his winning performance.

5|$|On 14 February 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was killed, {{along with}} 21 others, when his <b>motorcade</b> {{was struck by}} a {{roadside}} bomb in Beirut. He had been PM during 1992–1998 and 2000–2004. In 2009, the United Nations special tribunal investigating the murder of Hariri reportedly found evidence linking Hezbollah to the murder.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 1940, {{a preview}} of the highway was {{organized}} by commission chairman Jones. It began the previous night with a banquet at The Hotel Hershey and proceeded west along the turnpike, stopping at the Clear Ridge cut before lunch at the Midway service plaza.

25|$|Outside the airport, a few taxis {{attempted}} to blockade the highway, preventing Lien {{from reaching the}} airport, but they were repelled by the <b>motorcade's</b> police escort.

Aaron Pierce eventually saves her from the ambush on the Suvarovs' <b>motorcade.</b> Martha continues to question Logan's motives as her husband attempts to prevent her from finding out {{about his role in}} Palmer's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his <b>motorcade.</b> The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days so that he could see the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large hydroelectricity project in highland Victoria.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the <b>motorcade</b> departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
50|$|An escort {{can range}} widely in size, {{beginning}} with a single vehicle. They almost always assist with <b>motorcades</b> for the transportation of senior public officials, such as heads of state or heads of government, or can be hired by celebrities, professional athletes, or for funerals.|$|R
50|$|Outside the airport, a few taxis {{attempted}} to blockade the highway, preventing Lien {{from reaching the}} airport, but they were repelled by the <b>motorcade's</b> police escort.

5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B. Johnson, {{were close to}} {{securing}} their spots on the Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallas–Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a <b>motorcade</b> through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real <b>motorcade.</b> Police {{had no choice but to}} release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the <b>motorcade</b> that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E
50|$|Bacall {{campaigned for}} Democratic {{candidate}} Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election, accompanying him on <b>motorcades</b> along with Bogart, and flying east {{to help in}} the final laps of Stevenson's campaign in New York and Chicago. She also campaigned for Robert Kennedy in his 1964 run for the U.S. Senate.|$|R
25|$|For {{official}} {{visits to}} Australia, special plates are often put {{over the top}} of normal 'Z' plates, depicting the Australian Coat of Arms and, in red 'Visit to Australia' with a numeral. These are not strictly registration plates, but are useful for police and other officials to identify cars in official <b>motorcades.</b>|$|R
25|$|The APEC meeting {{has been}} widely criticised for having severe {{security}} arrangements, which resulted in closure of roads without sufficient warning as leaders' <b>motorcades</b> travelled around the city. Some Sydneysiders also feared similar disruptions to those experienced during the visit by US Vice President Dick Cheney which caused massive transport disruptions, including {{the closure of the}} Sydney Harbour Bridge.|$|R
