5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any <b>macroscale</b> position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. <b>Macroscale</b> processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves.

[...] While there are sensory advantages present at the <b>macroscale</b> compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; [...] similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. [...] Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.|$|E

2500|$|Nanotechnology ("nanotech") is [...] {{manipulation}} of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology [...] {{referred to the}} particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of <b>macroscale</b> products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the {{manipulation of}} matter {{with at least one}} dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form [...] "nanotechnologies" [...] as well as [...] "nanoscale technologies" [...] to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.
