Specific areas of investigation include outer planet and comet rendezvous mission analysis, NEP stage design for geocentric and interplanetary missions, and technology requirements for NEP stage development. A multimission NEP stage can be developed to perform both multiple geocentric and interplanetary missions for a 1983 launch. Identified pacing NEP technology requirements are the development of 20, 000 full power hour ion thrustors and thermionic reactor and the development of related power conditioning. The resulting NEP stage design provides both inherent reliability and high payload mass capability...|$|R

It is particularly suitable for Aviator’s Night Vision goggles, operations in urban areas or for special operations. ATG is a unique feature that operates constantly, electronically reducing the “duty cycle” of the photocathode voltage by very rapidly switching the voltage on and off. This maintains the optimum performance of the I² tube, continuously revealing <b>mission</b> <b>critical</b> details, safeguarding the I² tube from additional damage and protecting the user from temporary blindness.|$|E
25|$|The WBIL {{program was}} first envisioned in 1996 {{as a means}} to more {{efficiently}} utilize the civilian skills of RC personnel. The program was officially launched in 1997. The primary focus of the program was originally on Individual Ready Reserve personnel of the RC by allowing unit members to work remotely and accrue points towards retirement, while supporting IC and DoD requirements. WBIL participants are not required to have security clearances to perform their collection activities. The IC and the DoD benefit from this because WBIL participants support low-level IC and DoD mission tasking, thus allowing fully cleared personnel to concentrate on high-level, <b>mission</b> <b>critical</b> tasking.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} lose {{a game in}} several ways; by losing all his lives or through an action that makes a mission {{impossible}} to complete. These include destroying a <b>mission</b> <b>critical</b> object, killing someone who was to be captured or rescued, killing too many friendlies, allowing an objective to leave the battlefield, failing to protect a friendly target from being captured or destroyed, destroying your home base or landing zones, or waiting too long to complete a mission objective. After such an occurrence, the player must return to his home base and the level restarts from the beginning. In Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, if a player fails to return they are warned to return to base and after three warnings, STRIKE shuts down the players vehicle and the level will be restarted.|$|E

In 1983, CNES opted to focus its attention on a space plane as the agency had concluded that such a vehicle would deliver greater convenience, comfort, and cost-effectiveness. Opting for a space plane approach was found to simplify recovery due to it possessing the necessary cross-range manoeuvrability to reach a given point on the Earth within {{the space of a}} single day, while also providing for a less challenging re-entry environment for the crew and payload, while being reusable would also serve to reduce the cost of successive <b>missions.</b> <b>Critical</b> technologies identified included thermal protection, environmental controls, life support systems, aerodynamics, and power.|$|R

In order to encourage truthful reports from the squads, we design a token system that works as follows. Each squad keeps a token bank, with tokens deposited at a certain frequency. A squad must spend either 1 or 2 tokens to request the helicopter, while the commander assigns the helicopter to the squad who spends more tokens, or breaks a tie at random. The two selfish squads become players in a two-person non-zero-sum game. We find the Nash Equilibrium of this game, and use numerical examples to illustrate the benefit of the token system.
