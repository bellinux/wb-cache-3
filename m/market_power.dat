Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of <b>market</b> <b>power</b> that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{opened his}} own chemist shop in Brunswick West in 1918. On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in Ascot Vale, Victoria. Their {{marriage}} produced two children, {{a son who}} died in infancy and a daughter, Jean Marjorie. One of the witnesses at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer, Alan Ramsay, who later married Jean's sister Edna. In 1937, Simpson banded together with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd, today better known as Amcal. They invited other pharmacists to join them to compete against the growing <b>market</b> <b>power</b> of major retailers. The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946. Today Amcal is the largest retail pharmacy chain in Australia.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has <b>market</b> <b>power</b> or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
40|$|The {{commonly}} accepted {{assumption of}} {{a need for a}} market orientation for companies to be profitable led many authors to suggest an increase <b>marketing</b> <b>power</b> in strategic decision making. To achieve an enhanced <b>marketing</b> <b>power,</b> they encourage a growing <b>power</b> of Chief <b>Marketing</b> Officers (CMOs). In reality, while companies {{are becoming more and more}} market oriented, CMOs seem not to be increasing their power. This apparently controversial situation has generated a vivid debate in the marketing community aimed at understanding the phenomenon. We try to contribute to the debate by arguing that the correlation between <b>marketing</b> <b>power</b> and CMO power may be problematic in a market-oriented strategic paradigm. To do that we show the evidence of a longitudinal case study in a company shifting from product centricity to market orientation, observing that it has experienced a noticeable increase of <b>marketing</b> <b>power</b> without a significant increase of CMO power. The case suggested implications for practitioners and academicians alike...|$|R

25|$|Galbraith's main ideas focused {{around the}} {{influence}} of the <b>market</b> <b>power</b> of large corporations. He believed that this <b>market</b> <b>power</b> weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest <b>market</b> <b>power</b> to increase the production of their goods beyond an efficient amount. He further believed that <b>market</b> <b>power</b> {{played a major role in}} inflation. He argued that corporations and trade unions could only increase prices to the extent to which that their <b>market</b> <b>power</b> allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive <b>market</b> <b>power,</b> price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith's view of <b>market</b> <b>power</b> was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of U.S. firms played a part in the success of the U.S. economy.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some <b>market</b> <b>power</b> in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer <b>market</b> <b>power</b> is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E

25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to <b>market</b> <b>power</b> concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} view of {{the labor}} market has low-wage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more <b>market</b> <b>power</b> than do sellers (workers). This monopsony could be a result of intentional collusion between employers, or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets, search costs, information costs, imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets. In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.|$|E
