Ten minutes before the end, a cross by Don Roper into Blackpool’s penalty area was headed down by Lawton; the ball reached Lishman who scored again to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Arsenal's win.|$|E
5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his distance vision and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E

25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1613, d'Aragona landed 200 musketeers, 50 arquebusiers and 100 pikemen in Chicheri, {{where they}} stormed and {{demolished}} an Ottoman castle {{resulting in the}} deaths of over 800 Turks. Upon d'Aragona's return, Osuna ordered him to prepare a campaign to face the Ottoman fleet in its own waters. The Viceroy had been warned of the departure of a large fleet from Constantinople, and although his informers did not notice the preparation of any attack against the island, he preferred to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it. D'Aragona's galleys were reinforced, each one with 100 muskets, 50 spontoons, 20 bucklers and 150 chuzos in case it was necessary to arm the rowers to help the galley's soldiers to fight the Ottomans. Osuna's flagship, meanwhile, was reinforced with 160 musketeers and seven cannons. According to the Viceroy's spies, the Ottoman fleet was composed of 12 galleys under Mahomet Pasha, a lieutenant of Nasauf Pasha, who remained in Constantinople to consult with Sultan Ahmed I about issues concerning the war with Persia.|$|E
25|$|Blücher {{realized}} that Napoleon {{was trying to}} reach Laon by the Reims road. He sent Bülow and his wagon trains back to Laon. The Prussian commander began to shift his other forces to the northeast. By 6 March Napoleon had 30,500 men near Berry-au-Bac. He planned to send an advanced guard north toward Festieux, but needed to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Blücher's intentions. During the day of 6 March, Meunier's division encountered Russian forces near Vauclair Abbey (Vauclerc) while two battalions of the Old Guard were needed to flush out Craonne's Russian defenders. At first Blücher directed his army to concentrate near Craonne, but he decided that position was too cramped for his 90,000 men. He also heard that French cavalry were advancing north on the Reims road. Changing plans, Blücher planned to assemble 10,000 cavalry and 60 horse artillery guns under Wintzingerode and send it toward Festieux. Wintzingerode's force consisted of 5,500 of his own horsemen plus all of the reserve cavalry belonging to Langeron and Yorck. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode's infantry, commanded by Vorontsov, to remain behind and directly oppose Napoleon's army.|$|E

2500|$|The {{election}} of Sigismund III {{proved to be}} the greatest possible blow to inflict upon Protestantism in Poland. Brought up by his mother, Catherine Jagiellon, in the strictest Roman Catholic doctrines, he made the promotion of the interests of Rome the guiding motive of all his actions. This zeal for Rome outweighed all considerations of prudence or policy; through it he lost two hereditary thrones and brought innumerable calamities on the country that had elected him: [...] "In order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> heaven he has renounced Earth", said Emperor Ferdinand II of the Holy Roman Empire. The Protestants called him the King of the Jesuits, and Sigismund gloried in the appellation. This feeble imitation of Philip II of Spain possessed all the bigotry and zeal of his model without his abilities or strength of character. Sigismund was heavily influenced by the Jesuits; according to contemporary opinions he bestowed honours only on those whom they favoured, and preferred their advice to that of his wisest counselors.|$|E

2500|$|The Kennedy {{campaign}} {{began to}} focus on Oregon. Its workers repeatedly denied that Morse was a serious candidate, but to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> a win, the campaign sent Rose Kennedy and Ted Kennedy to speak in Oregon and outspent Morse $54,000 to $9,000. [...] Morse often found himself responding to Kennedy’s claim that he was not a “serious candidate”, by proclaiming: “I’m a dead serious candidate.” Quietly, Oregon Democrats began to worry about what a loss for Morse would mean in 1962 against possible Republican challenger Governor Mark Hatfield. Morse would use this to his advantage to help sway undecided Democrats, claiming that if he lost in the primary, it would certainly help Republicans defeat him in 1962. Kennedy brushed off this argument by claiming that regardless of the outcome of the presidential primary, the people of Oregon had a tremendous respect for Wayne Morse and would send him back to the Senate, and that he would even come back to Oregon in 1962 to campaign for him. [...] On Election Day, Morse came up roughly 50,000 votes short of defeating Kennedy. Morse abandoned his presidential race that same week.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday 16 October {{the tournament}} was rounded {{off with the}} Barbados v Guyana final. Barbados were {{inserted}} by the Guyana captain Chanderpaul, and though they lost no wickets in their opening 25 overs, they scored at a rate below four an over as they were 90 for no loss midway through their innings. Guyana spinners Mahendra Nagamootoo then got the first breakthrough, dismissing Kurt Wilkinson for 43, and though Martin Nurse went on to hit 63 and Ryan Hinds and Floyd Reifer also hit scores in excess of 30, Nagamootoo and Neil McGarrell shared six wickets in their 18 overs, and Barbados lost four wickets for 16 to end {{with a total of}} 249 for 8. Chasing, Guyana started with a 92-run opening partnership between Sewnarine Chattergoon and Krishna Arjune before Bradshaw and Collymore broke through for Barbados, dismissing Arjune and their West Indies team partners Sarwan and Chanderpaul, leaving Guyana at 119 for 3. TV replays indicated to Guyana Chronicle writer Allan La Rose that Chanderpaul had not hit the ball when he was given out caught behind, but in the end it mattered little - Chattergoon put on a further 90 with Deonarine, as Guyana reached 209 for 4 with 55 balls remaining, but when Deonarine was dismissed another three Guyanese followed, including Chattergoon, bowled by Fidel Edwards for 119. He later rated the innings the [...] "best of his life". At the end of Edwards' over, the umpires offered the light to the batsmen, but McGarrell and Darwin Christian chose to bat on to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the victory. They lost no further wicket in the next three overs before they were offered the light again, requiring three to win off the final over, which was not bowled; instead, Guyana were declared seven-run winners on the Duckworth-Lewis method.|$|E
