Section 2. 0 defines the primary objectives for this report, Section 3. 0 discusses the scope and assumptions, and Section 4. 0 identifies general characterization needs and analyte-specific characterization needs or potential needs included in program documents and charts. Section 4. 0 also shows the analyses that have been conducted, and the archive samples that are available for additional analyses. Section 5. 0 discusses current plans for obtaining additional samples and analyses to meet readiness-to-proceed requirements. Section 6. 0 summarizes sampling needs based on preliminary requirements and discusses other potential characterization needs. Many requirements documents are preliminary. In many cases, problem-specific DQOs have not been drafted, and only general assumptions about the document contents could be obtained from the authors. As a result, the readiness-to-proceed characterization requirements provided in this document are evolving and may change...|$|E
