50|$|The {{business}} prospered {{under his}} care, and, finding money at his command, Esdaile widened {{the scope of}} his tastes, and began to frequent sales of prints. His earlier purchases were sparing and cheap, but, distrusting his own judgment, he engaged a professional assistant, accompanied by whom he attended all the great auctions in London. Though prints formed {{the bulk of his}} collection, he also largely purchased, as opportunity offered, coins, china, books, and the general miscellanea of the sale-room. Towards the last few years of his life, when his <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up,</b> he abandoned his usual caution, and spent on a large and sometimes reckless scale, greatly to the advantage of his collection, which was {{considered one of the most}} valuable in England. It was sold after his death, the sale extending over sixteen days. The chief attractions were the very complete set of Rembrandt etchings and Claude drawings, which Esdaile had bought on the dispersal of Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection, and a large selection from the best work of the early Italian engravers.|$|R

Shards and shreds of copper cloud split off continually and floated by themselves, {{and for some reason}} the truculent eye of Turnbull was attracted to one of these careering cloudlets, which seemed to him to career in an exaggerated manner. Also it kept its shape, which is unusual with clouds shaken off; also its shape was of an odd sort.|$|R
