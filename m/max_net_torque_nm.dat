40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>net</b> <b>torques</b> {{applied to the}} {{lithosphere}} by ridge and trench forces as implied {{by the absence of}} recent true polar wander is explored. The 'ridge push' and 'trench pull' forces and the potential <b>net</b> <b>torques</b> on the global lithosphere contributed by each of these forces are discussed. It is shown that the relative magnitudes of the <b>net</b> <b>torques</b> contributed by ridge and trench forces are constrained by the absence of true polar wander during the Cenozoic and by the magnitudes of basal shear stresses on the faster moving plates. It is suggested that the lack of recent true polar wander may be due at least in part to the coincidence of a near cancellation of <b>net</b> <b>torques</b> contributed by ridge and trench forces...|$|R

40|$|Two methods, both {{based on}} the concept of {{combustion}} <b>net</b> <b>torque,</b> for estimation of combustion properties using measurements of crankshaft torque data are investigated in this work. The first of the proposed methods estimates entire burned mass fraction traces from corresponding combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> traces. This is done by solving a convex optimization problem that is based on a derived analytical relation between the two quantities. The other proposed estimation method estimates the well established combustion phasing measure referred to as 50 % burned mass fraction directly from combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> using a nonlinear black-box mapping. The methods are assessed using both simulations and experimental data gathered from a 5 -cylinder light-duty diesel engine equipped with a crankshaft torque sensor and cylinder pressure sensors that are used for reference measurements. The results indicate that both methods work well but the method that estimates entire burned mass fraction traces is more sensitive to torque data quality. Based on the experimental crankshaft torque data, the direct combustion phasing estimation method delivers estimates with a bias of less than 1 CAD and a cycle-to-cycle standard deviation of less than 2. 7 CAD for all cylinders...|$|R
