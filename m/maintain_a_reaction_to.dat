50|$|The UK's first {{full-scale}} {{nuclear reactor}} was the Windscale Pile in Sellafield. The pile was {{designed specifically for}} the production of plutonium-239 which was bred in slow reactions taking place in natural uranium fuel. Under normal conditions, natural uranium is not sensitive enough to its own neutrons <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> chain <b>reaction.</b> <b>To</b> improve the fuel's sensitivity to neutrons, a neutron moderator is used, in this case highly purified graphite.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the safety}} {{concerns}} associated with the waste tanks on the Hanford site {{is the presence of}} organics in a highly oxidizing environment that could potentially act as a fuel source <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> propagating <b>reaction.</b> <b>To</b> determine this risk, it is necessary to determine the amount of high enthalpy organics present in the tanks. Currently, the primary ways of obtaining this information are to either rely on tank-fill histories, which are often unreliable and do not account for waste-aging processes, or obtain samples from the tank and speciate the organics present through a series of analytical procedures. While organic speciation has been successful in providing very valuable information about organics present in the tanks and the waste aging processes that are occurring in general, it can be costly and time consuming analyzing a large number of waste tanks. Differential scanning calorimetry has previously been used to obtain heat of reaction measurements of Hanford tank waste samples. However, differential scanning calorimetry is shown here to inadequately measure calculated heats of reaction of simulant tank mixtures. Overall, the preliminary results presented here, suggest that indeed Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy would be useful screening tools for determination of C-H and COO- organic content in tank waste samples analyzed in a hot cell environment. These techniques however, are not truly quantitative for this application and would be primarily used for identifying tanks of potential safety concern that would require further, more detailed confirmatory analysis by organic speciation techniques...|$|R
