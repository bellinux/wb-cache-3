500|$|Filming for {{exterior}} scenes set in {{the country}} began on February 15, 1939 in Sologne and outside the Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin. Renoir later said he chose Sologne because his father Pierre-August Renoir [...] "regretted {{that he had never}} been able to paint [...] How well I understand the sincerity of those regrets before these beautiful landscapes of Sologne, in astonishing colors, of a grace so melancholy yet so gentle." [...] Renoir said Sologne's mist [...] "took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> happy days of my childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Olga {{experienced}} {{her first}} brush with violence at age fifteen, when she witnessed {{the assassination of}} the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. [...] "Olga and Tatiana had followed <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box and saw everything that happened", Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on September 10, 1911. [...] "…It had made a great impression on Tatiana, who cried a lot, and they both slept badly." [...] Three years later, she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a Red Cross nurse. Olga, her sister Tatiana, and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, Paige began {{a weekly}} Sunday {{afternoon}} radio show, Elaine Paige on Sunday, between 1 and 3 PM on BBC Radio2, featuring music from musical theatre and film. The 400th edition was broadcast on Sunday 29 July 2012. In an unfavourable review, {{the show was}} described by Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian as [...] "a chilly, alienating listening experience" [...] and a [...] "rare wrong move" [...] {{on the part of}} Radio2. Lisa Martland of The Stage agreed that [...] "it is by far the music that brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> programme... and not her lightweight presenting style". However, the show regularly attracts 3million listeners, and interviews are also featured each week. Paige also focused on television appearances, playing Dora Bunner in the 2005 ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced in the Marple series, before performing a guest role as a post mistress in Where the Heart Is. The episode of Marple was watched by 7.78million viewers.|$|E

6000|$|... "As for me," [...] {{declared}} Nora, solemnly, [...] "nothing {{shall make}} <b>me</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Islands,--unless Mr. Stanbury should {{tell me to}} do so." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{threw up}} his arms at the last words with a fierce, {{threatening}} gesture, and, turning away from <b>me,</b> strode <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruined hut.|$|R
500|$|At {{the age of}} 17, O'Hara {{was offered}} her first major role at the Abbey Theatre, but was distracted by the attentions of actor-singer Harry Richman. Richman {{arranged}} with {{the manager of the}} Gresham Hotel in Dublin to meet her at the hotel while she was dining with her family. He proposed that she go to Elstree Studios for a screen test and become a film actress. O'Hara arrived in London shortly afterwards with her mother. During the screen test, the studio adorned her in a [...] "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings" [...] and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style, which was deemed to be far from satisfactory. O'Hara detested the audition, during which she had to walk in and pick up a telephone. She recalled thinking to herself, [...] "My God, get <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbey". Charles Laughton later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes. After seeking the approval of his business partner Erich Pommer, they arranged to meet O'Hara through a talent agency run by Connie Chapman and Vere Barker. Laughton was impressed with O'Hara, particularly by her lack of nerves and refusal to read an extract upon his request unprepared, during which she said: [...] "I am very sorry but absolutely no". She was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Though her family were shocked at her being given a contract so young, they accepted, and O'Hara traveled across Ireland in celebration before arriving back in London to commence her film career. O'Hara later stated that [...] "I owe my whole career to Mr. Pommer".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Ponor began {{training}} with Mariana Bitang again. She said: [...] "She's {{the only person}} who can bring <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> form I was in. She's the only coach who can guide me to a world title and another Olympic title." [...] Bitang added, [...] "We saw her very determined, and we were very surprised to see her appetite for competition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walker wrote, [...] "At {{one point}} I learned Transcendental Meditation. This was 30-something years ago. It took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> way that I {{naturally}} {{was as a}} child growing up way in the country, rarely seeing people. I was in that state of oneness with creation {{and it was as if}} I didn't exist except as a part of everything." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{have not}} made this plain enough to any of you, my friends, let <b>me</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> simple, {{practical}} explanation of it which God Himself has given us in those two words--father and child.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood before}} <b>me,</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peasant crowd, {{ignoring}} them as completely {{as if they}} had no existence, supremely master of himself. And meanwhile, the little lady on his arm stole furtive upward glances at me.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} so until Castelroux had withdrawn {{and the door}} had closed again; then, turning suddenly, he confronted <b>me,</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light, so that his face was in a shadow that heightened its gloom and wonted weariness.|$|R
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in a Scots Pine forest {{situated}} in the Guadarrama mountain range, Central Spain. Guillermo Navarro, the director of photography, said that [...] "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story".|$|E
2500|$|The second {{reference}} was excised {{from the}} final version but is of interest {{in that it is}} a rare reference to his father; Beckett’s writing is generally matricentric. The writing breaks down following this sentimental passage where C recalls a fishing trip with his father: “Bring <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hot summer evening out in the Bay with my father in the little rowboat, fishing for mackerel with a spinner. To the time when it was all still time. ‘Do you remember what they look like?’ ‘Yes, father, all blue and silver.’” When Beckett discussed this with James Knowlson in 1989 he used the exact turn of phrase, “‘fishing for mackerel with a spinner’ … that he had used over thirty years before in his rejected play fragment.” Even accounting for Beckett’s astounding memory this was an exceptionally clear and vivid recollection. In more typical Beckett fashion the image resurfaced in Texts for Nothing: “Yes, I’m here forever, with the spinners and the dead flies, dancing to the tremor of their meshed wings…” ...|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why----" [...] Claire was {{obviously}} {{shocked by the}} impropriety of the suggestion. She looked at Mrs. Gilson, who was breathing {{as though she was}} just going under the ether. Claire said doubtfully, [...] "Well---- If you can get <b>me</b> right <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house----" ...|$|R
6000|$|The latter {{reflection}} took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sergeant, with {{a polite}} intimation that I {{could not find}} it in my heart to leave him by himself. [...] "Is there anything you don't understand up there?" [...] I added, pointing to Miss Rachel's window.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never," [...] he answered, passionately {{clasping}} at her hand. [...] "Call {{yourself by}} what name you will, I love you. If {{you are in}} trouble, let me help.

6000|$|... "It matters not," [...] said Richard; [...] "be it {{greater or}} smaller, bestow {{it all on}} this learned leech, who hath, I trust, given <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service of the Crusade. If it be less than a {{thousand}} byzants, let him have jewels to make it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle!" [...] I called softly. The {{sound of}} my own voice seemed to {{invigorate}} me, to strip me of my awkwardness and self-consciousness. It broke the spell {{that for a moment}} had been over me, and brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> myself--to <b>the</b> vain, self-confident, flamboyant Bardelys that perhaps you have pictured from my writings.|$|R
60|$|This brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{point at}} which I diverged--the Great Fish River, which takes its rise in the Sneewberg range.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after making}} contact, Torre and Maysles (David {{had died in}} 1984) {{reconnected}} and conversed for hours, with the documentarian filming the entire time. Maysles recalled, [...] "Seeing Jerry again brought <b>me</b> right <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time when {{we were all in}} the same little bedroom together and he was eating corn cooked by Mrs. Beale." ...|$|R
60|$|And he sobbed {{again and}} said: 'Mother, my {{suffering}} {{is greater than}} I can bear. Give me thy forgiveness, and let <b>me</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest.'
