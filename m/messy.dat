5|$|Double Dare is an American {{television}} {{game show}} on which two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing <b>messy</b> stunts known as physical challenges. Hosted by Marc Summers, the program premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986, {{as its first}} game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{the festival}} {{was once again}} struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers {{departed}} early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur. Tony Bennett, however, overcame the <b>messy</b> environment in an immaculate white suit and tie. 1998 {{was also the first}} year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and <b>messy.</b> According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} are <b>Messier</b> 49 (elliptical), <b>Messier</b> 58 (spiral), <b>Messier</b> 59 (elliptical), <b>Messier</b> 60 (elliptical), <b>Messier</b> 61 (spiral), <b>Messier</b> 84 (lenticular), <b>Messier</b> 86 (lenticular), <b>Messier</b> 87 (elliptical and a famous radio source), <b>Messier</b> 89 (elliptical) and <b>Messier</b> 90 (spiral). A noted galaxy {{that is not}} part of the cluster is the Sombrero Galaxy (M104), an unusual spiral galaxy. It is located about 10° due west of Spica.|$|R
50|$|Leo {{contains}} many bright galaxies; <b>Messier</b> 65, <b>Messier</b> 66, <b>Messier</b> 95, <b>Messier</b> 96, <b>Messier</b> 105, and NGC 3628 {{are the most}} famous, the first two {{being part of the}} Leo Triplet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Messier</b> 91 was {{discovered}} {{on the night}} of March 18, 1781, Charles <b>Messier</b> described it as Nebula without stars, fainter than M90. <b>Messier</b> mistakenly logged its position from <b>Messier</b> 58, where in fact it should have been <b>Messier</b> 89. William Herschel observed the same galaxy on April 8, 1784.|$|R
5|$|Wish Bear {{tells them}} that wishes {{are not an}} {{effective}} solution any more, and everyone works together to make their home beautiful again ("It Takes You and Me"). At the end, Me Bear, <b>Messy</b> Bear, and Too Loud Bear, having seen the error of their ways, apologize and ask if they can still live in Care-a-lot. The rest of the bears agree and decide {{to go on a}} road trip.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{challenges}} {{were often}} <b>messy</b> stunts that a team had {{to perform in}} a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on Double Dare 2000 were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team won money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control passed to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including <b>messy</b> footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs {{may come to}} vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price of}} goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Messier</b> 105 was {{discovered}} by Pierre Méchain on 24 March 1781, {{just a few days}} after he discovered the nearby galaxies <b>Messier</b> 95 and <b>Messier</b> 96. [...] This galaxy is one of several that were not originally included in the original <b>Messier</b> Catalogue compiled by Charles <b>Messier.</b> <b>Messier</b> 105 was included in the catalog only when Helen S. Hogg found a letter by Méchain describing <b>Messier</b> 105 and when the object described by Méchain was identified as a galaxy previously named NGC 3379.|$|R
25|$|Due to its {{location}} on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects such as the open clusters <b>Messier</b> 6 (the Butterfly Cluster) and <b>Messier</b> 7 (the Ptolemy Cluster), NGC 6231 (by ζ² Sco), and the globular clusters <b>Messier</b> 4 and <b>Messier</b> 80.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Messier</b> 60 and {{the nearby}} galaxy <b>Messier</b> 59 were both {{discovered}} by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 during observations of a comet in the same part of the sky. [...] Charles <b>Messier</b> listed both in the <b>Messier</b> Catalogue about three days after Koehler's discovery.|$|R
5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a <b>messy</b> {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the <b>messy</b> part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and <b>messy</b> colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
50|$|<b>Messier</b> came {{up against}} {{opposition}} from Navy astronomer Joseph Nicholas Delisle, who had employed <b>Messier</b> from October 1751, because Delisle would not publish the discovery <b>Messier</b> had made. This was {{a continuation of}} the mistrust that had developed between <b>Messier</b> and Delisle because Delisle had been slow to publish work done by <b>Messier</b> in 1759; <b>Messier</b> had independently rediscovered Halley's Comet on 21 January 1759 but because <b>Messier</b> had doubted the correctness of Delisle's path, Delisle instructed <b>Messier</b> to continue observing the comet and refused to announce his discovery. Delisle apparently later changed his mind and announced the discovery on 1 April 1759, but other French astronomers discredited Delisle's claim, labelling the discovery an April Fools' joke. Delisle retired in 1760.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Messier</b> 59 and {{the nearby}} {{elliptical}} galaxy <b>Messier</b> 60 were both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 during observations of a comet in the same part of the sky. [...] Charles <b>Messier</b> listed both in the <b>Messier</b> Catalogue about three days after Koehler's discovery.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Messier</b> {{marathon}} is an attempt, usually {{organized by}} amateur astronomers, to find as many <b>Messier</b> objects as possible during one night. The <b>Messier</b> catalogue was compiled by French astronomer Charles <b>Messier</b> {{during the late}} 18th century and consists of 110 relatively bright deep sky objects (galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters).|$|R
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets in Chicago for their third {{straight}} victory. The matchup was a <b>messy</b> one, marked by turnovers and rough play by both sides. The teams combined for eight fumbles and four interceptions, and play was stopped {{several times to}} break up fights. Chicago was penalized 30 yards for unnecessary roughness, while Cleveland was penalized 15 yards. Despite the interruptions and frequent turnovers, Cleveland quarterback Otto Graham had his best game of the season, throwing three touchdowns and rushing for a fourth. Bob Cowan caught two of the touchdowns. Chicago, meanwhile, scored just one touchdown – a short pass to Elroy Hirsch from quarterback Angelo Bertelli in the second quarter. Chicago successfully contained Marion Motley, Cleveland's most productive back, who finished the game with 49 yards on 14 carries. The final score was 28–7.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{try to kill}} {{themselves}} five times, failing each time. Eventually, they make a pact to end their lives on 31 December 2009. With 20 days left before their deadline, they decide to fulfill their unrealised wishes and begin a journey together. Kiara helps Akash find a date and shares with him how Kunal cheated on her. The next day, Akash cleans Kiara's <b>messy</b> apartment. Though he cannot swim, Akash is forced to fulfil Kiara's wish to swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean. However, at sea Kiara falls overboard and Akash rescues her. Their yacht drifts away, stranding them. As the two slowly succumb to hypothermia, Kiara continues telling her story to Akash. They are rescued again by the Coast Guard officer who intervened on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so <b>messy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially <b>messy</b> business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Messier</b> Catalog - The <b>Messier</b> {{objects are}} {{a set of}} astronomical objects first listed by French {{astronomer}} Charles <b>Messier</b> in 1771. Nebulae and Star Clusters was published in 1781, with objects M1 - M110.|$|R

25|$|Another non-prescription {{treatment}} of candidia is gentian violet. It usually works, and relief is rapid. It is <b>messy,</b> and will stain clothing. The baby's lips will turn purple, but the purple will disappear {{after a few}} days.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>Messier</b> {{compiled}} his catalog from {{a northern}} latitude, {{not all of}} the <b>Messier</b> objects are visible from the southern hemisphere. In particular, M81, M82, M52, and M103 make southern-hemisphere <b>Messier</b> marathons difficult, because they are all located at a declination of 60° north or greater. Although a <b>Messier</b> marathon can be attempted from any northern latitude, low northern latitudes are best. In particular, a latitude of around 25° north lends the best possibility to complete a <b>Messier</b> marathon at the right time of year.|$|R
50|$|<b>Messier</b> 99 was {{discovered}} by Pierre Méchain on March 17, 1781. The discovery was then reported to Charles <b>Messier,</b> who included the object in the <b>Messier</b> Catalogue, {{which was the first}} astronomical catalogue of star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies.|$|R
