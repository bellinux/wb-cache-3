5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> and digestible than other grains.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{results for}} the LGIT {{indicate}} that at one month {{approximately half of the}} patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> meals.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, <b>more</b> <b>palatable,</b> less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
50|$|After {{the rise}} to power of the Nazis in 1933, all sports {{associations}} with left-leaning or faith-based affiliations were disbanded. The memberships of these clubs were dispersed or forced into mergers with sides <b>more</b> ideologically <b>palatable</b> to the regime and the clubs' assets were expropriated. The KG was broken up in February 1933, followed by the ATSB in May.|$|R

Will he back the Fair Work Commission 2 ̆ 7 s non-binding recommendations that give much of what the militant united firefighters union want and is desperately opposed by the Country Fire Authority - as his approving comments from New York seem to indicate? Or will he negotiate a <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> deal?  ...|$|R
5|$|The {{mushrooms}} of Russula brevipes often develop under {{masses of}} conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and fruit from summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band {{at the top}} of the stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior. Although edible, Russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. They become <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> once parasitized by the ascomycete fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum, a bright orange mold that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E
25|$|Many radical Northerners withdrew {{their support}} for land reform in the years {{following}} the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.|$|R

5|$|Although predators of phoronids are {{not well}} known, they include fish, {{gastropods}} (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). Phoronopsis viridis, which reaches densities of 26,500 per square meter on tidal flats in California (USA), is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators, including fish and crabs. The unpalatability is strongest in the top section, including the lophophore, which is exposed to predators when phoronids feed. When the lophophores were removed in an experiment, the phoronids were <b>more</b> <b>palatable,</b> but this effect reduced over 12 days as the lophophores regenerated. These broadly effective defenses, which appear unusual among invertebrates inhabiting soft sediment, may be important in allowing Phoronopsis viridis to reach high densities. Some parasites infest phoronids: progenetic metacercariae and cysts of trematodes in phoronids' coelomic cavities; unidentified gregarines in phoronids' digestive tract; and an ancistrocomid ciliate parasite, Heterocineta, in the tentacles.|$|E
5|$|Like other Jacobin novels, The Wrongs of Woman {{relies on}} a web of suggestive {{character}} names to convey its message: Jemima is named for Job's daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of Henry Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer George, Prince of Wales. Wollstonecraft added {{to the reality of}} her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as Shakespeare, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. The Wrongs of Woman comments on the state of women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the club begins with the 1906 {{establishment}} of Concordia Babelsberg. The club was lost in 1933 when left-leaning worker's sports clubs were disbanded under the Third Reich. A side <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> to the regime was formed in 1934 as VfL Eintracht 06 Babelsberg. This club was also in its turn lost {{in the aftermath of}} World War II when organizations across Germany, including sports and football associations, were dissolved by occupying Allied authorities.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a [...] "moderniser" [...] faction emerged within the party, favouring a <b>more</b> electorally <b>palatable</b> {{strategy}} and {{an emphasis on}} building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by the electoral gains made {{by a number of}} extreme-right parties in continental Europe—such as Jörg Haider's Austrian Freedom Party and Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front—which had been achieved by both switching focus from biological racism to the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups and by replacing anti-democratic platforms with populist ones.|$|R
50|$|As a workers club, {{the team}} {{played in the}} Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund (ATSB). With the rise to power of the Nazis this league was {{dissolved}} and many workers clubs disappeared or became part of associations that were <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> to the regime. FT slipped to lower tier play {{until the end of}} World War II when all organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, were ordered dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-established on 20 January 1946 as ASV Bergedorf 1885.|$|R
5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed Bradley in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, Bradley {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{marriage}} to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots' most trusted northern lords, and the lord's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll, may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander's approval against Rögnvaldr. In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye, the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two—with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions. In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority into what is today the western coast Scotland, making several expeditions into Argyll. A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander, installing Domnall mac Ragnaill, a <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> member of Clann Somairle, in his place. Óláfr's control of Lewis and Skye, bordering the domains of Clann Somairle, may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander's eyes, who wished {{to rein in the}} more dangerous members of Clann Somairle.|$|E

5000|$|First, by {{measure of}} {{creating}} and/or maintaining an affordable housing {{stock in the}} United States, mixed income housing {{can be considered a}} success. Mixed income housing developments are a <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> option to housing lower income members of society, particularly in communities with deep resistance to building affordable housing or having public housing relocated through a scattered sites policy. Therefore, mixed income housing as a policy strategy has taken hold in the United States not because it is expected to alleviate poverty, but rather because of many ancillary benefits that accrue to the neighborhood, city, and all residents.|$|R
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line <b>more</b> <b>palatable</b> to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

5000|$|In 1975 at Detroit’s United Sound Studios with {{engineer}} Jim Vitti, they recorded seven songs {{written by}} David and Bobby. According to the Hackney family, Columbia Records president Clive Davis funded the recording sessions, but implored the band {{to change its}} name to something <b>more</b> commercially <b>palatable</b> than Death. When the Hackneys refused, Davis ceased his support. The band only recorded seven songs instead of the planned dozen. The following year they self-released (on their label Tryangle) a single taken from the sessions: [...] "Politicians in My Eyes" [...] b/w [...] "Keep on Knocking," [...] in a run of just 500 copies.|$|R

It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients <b>more</b> <b>palatable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{military}} {{historians have}} pointed out that Westmoreland became chief of staff at the worst time in history with regard to the Army.

However, many hard-liners scorned these as too liberal. Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of South Carolina in 1974.|$|E
50|$|The Mirage IIIV was a {{competitor}} with Hawker Siddeley's P.1154 VTOL fighter, {{a cousin of}} the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Both aircraft competed to be selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement. While the Mirage IIIV is commonly viewed as being <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable</b> due to an emphasis having been placed upon multinational development and manufacturing plans, the design of P.1154 (which only used a single engine) was seen as more straightforward and practical. Ultimately the P.1154 was selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement {{to the detriment of}} the Mirage IIIV. One of the two prototypes constructed was destroyed in an accident; shortly following its loss, the whole project was abandoned; the surviving aircraft has since been placed on public display.|$|R

40|$|Coping {{with aging}} populations is a {{challenge}} for most developed countries. The support of non-working adults can create an unsustainable burden on those working. One {{way of dealing with}} this is to raise the normal pension age, but this has proven to be unpopular. A complementary approach is to raise the average labor force participation rate. These policies are generally <b>more</b> politically <b>palatable.</b> We conceptualized and estimated, for the first time, the tradeoff between pension age and labor force participation rate policies and show that, in most European countries, a difference in policies that results in an increase in labor force participation rates by an additional one to two percentage points by 2050 can substitute for a one year increase in the normal pension age...|$|R
