Proper operation and control of these devices allows maintaining proper electricity parameters and the continuous supply to end consumers. In the group of electricity transforming devices transformers can be distinguished by {{the ability to control}} both the magnitude and phase angle of voltage. In this way transmission system state parameters are adjusted, which enable selecting the reactive and active power. On the one hand, these are devices of a complex structure, resulting in difficult operating conditions, while on the other hand they provide a potential opportunity to influence the power flow (including active power) in power grids.

40|$|Transformer {{stations}} in North America remain a crucially overlooked asset within the energy infrastructure. The {{low levels of}} protection applied, and susceptibility to fire and explosives in North America’s energy transformer stations represent a weakness, and individually, a {{single point of failure}} in the North American energy infrastructure.

40|$|The issue {{involved}} in the simultaneous matching of H+ and H- beams between an RFQ and DTL {{lies in the fact}} that both beams experience the same electric-field forces at a given position in the RFQ. Hence, the two beams are focused to the same correlation. However, matching to a DTL requires correlation of the opposite sign. The Brown-Servranckx [1] quarter-wave (λ / 4) <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> system, which requires four quadrupoles, provides a method to simultaneously match H+ and H − beams between an RFQ and a DTL. The method requires the use of a special RFQ section to obtain the Twiss parameter conditions βx = β y and α x = αy = 0 at the exit of the RFQ [2]. This matching between the RFQ and DTL is described below. O/ 4 <b>Matching</b> <b>Transformer</b> Figure 1 shows the two-quadrupole-λ 4 <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> with an additional quadrupole placed at each end to produce the appropriate Twiss parameters to match to the FODO lattice of the downstream DTL. This 4 -quadrupole transport section will transform a beam with Twiss parameters βx 1 = β y 1 and α x 1 = −αy 1 to a beam having Twiss parameters βx 2 = β y 2 and α x 2 = −αy 2. The middle two focusing elements plus the three drift lengths comprise the λ 4 - (quarter wave) transport. Quadrupole Q 1, placed where βx = β y and α x = −αy, adjusts α while preserving the condition α x = −αy and is used to adjust the beam size at Q 2 while the quarter wave transformer preserves the condition βx = β y and α x = −αy. Quadrupole Q 2 is used to obtain the final desired α while again preserving the condition α x = −αy. Because of the time varying nature of the RFQ, the H+ and H − beams have the relationship α x (H+) = α x(H −), and α y(H +) = αy (H −) at the exit of the RFQ; but, in a dc quadrupole channel, the matched beam satisfies α x (H+) = α y(H −) and α y(H +) = αx (H −). By setting α x = αy = 0, for both H and H − at the end of the RFQ, the Brown-Servranckx [1] <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> can be used for matching...|$|R

50|$|The {{very high}} output {{impedance}} of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires <b>matching</b> <b>transformers</b> to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or cutting lathe heads. The transformer {{is used as}} the load, {{in place of the}} resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps, <b>matching</b> output <b>transformers</b> are required for public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.|$|R
