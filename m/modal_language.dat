Serial music {{is represented by}} choral works by Arnold Schoenberg, including the anthem Dreimal Tausend Jahre, while the composer's signature use of sprechstimme is evident in his setting of Psalm 130 De Profundis. Paul Hindemith's distinctive <b>modal</b> <b>language</b> is represented by both his a cappella Mass and his Six Chansons (to texts by Rilke), while a more contrapuntally dissonant style comes through in his secular requiem, When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd. Olivier Messiaen also demonstrates dissonant counterpoint in his Cinq Rechants, which tell the Tristan and Isolde story. Charles Ives' psalm settings exemplify the composer's incomparably radical harmonic language. Tone clusters and aleatory elements play {{a prominent role in}} the choral music of Krzysztof Penderecki, who wrote the St. Luke Passio, and György Ligeti, who wrote both a Requiem and a separate Lux Aeterna. Milton Babbitt incorporated integral serialism into works for children's chorus, while Daniel Pinkham wrote for choir and electronic tape. Meredith Monk's Panda Chant and Astronaut Anthem explore overtones in an unconventional text setting.

This paper motivates {{the development of}} hybrid languages, sketches their history, and examines the expressive power of three hybrid binders.

In the case of L(#), we can combine these ideas relatively straightforwardly with the aid of analogs of the Barcan axioms coupled with a modal theory of labeling.

40|$|We {{investigate}} hybridization of Arrow Logic. Hybridization is {{a general}} technique for increasing the power of modal logics. A hybrid extension of a given modal logic can be obtained in two stages: first adding a new sort of variables considered as formulas whose intended meaning is to denote points in the domains of the frames then introducing mechanisms for handling the now available information (e. g. the satisfiability operator @ and the down-arrow binder ↓).

Thus it extends strictly the language Lµ of the modal µ-calculus. The basic <b>modal</b> <b>language</b> is known to be closed for relativisation [Pla 89] and for product update [BMS 99, Ger 99]. Lµ has also been shown to be closed for both relativisation and for product update [BI 08].

We obtain as a corollary the result in [BI 08] that Lµ is closed for product update. We also show how the technique we use, of using ‘action nominals’, can be applied to obtain more closure results in hybrid logic. Closures Assuming familiarity with modal logic, we will define in this Section what we mean by ‘closure for relativisation ’ and ‘closure for product update’.
