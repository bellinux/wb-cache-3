500|$|In medicine, silver is {{incorporated}} into wound dressings {{and used as}} an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as they can to antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial {{in a variety of}} industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry.

This subject started to attract me for the reasons of an untraditional view of nurses everyday work because they get in contact with preparing and administering <b>medicaments</b> several times a day. It was also interesting to compare the theoretical part with the practical aspects of the matter. In the theoretical part I outlined the entire knowledge nurses are to have not to endanger themselves or the patients {{in the course of}} handling <b>medicaments.</b> Nurses have to know the terminology related to <b>medicaments,</b> further what forms of <b>medicaments</b> there are, what effects may be expected, they are also supposed to know the manner of the application of <b>medicaments,</b> the manner of preparing and administering <b>medicaments,</b> what mistakes nurses may meet with when working with <b>medicaments</b> and what roles nurses have when administering <b>medicaments.</b> I am focusing especially on administering <b>medicaments</b> orally. The objectives of my thesis was to survey in what way nurses conduct hand hygiene before preparing and administering <b>medicaments,</b> whether they use aids intended for handling <b>medicaments,</b> in what way <b>medicaments</b> are prepared and administered to patients. To obtain results, I used the qualitative research. In total, 2 techniques were used. The first technique was hidden observation based on an observation list prepared beforehand, with activities connected with the subject in question. This observation was completed with a second technique [...] a structured conversation with open questions. Both the observation and the structured conversation were conducted in the intern section of the České Budějovice Hospital, a. s.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Endodontic {{regeneration}} (ERP) {{has been}} successfully used {{in the treatment of}} traumatized immature teeth. The procedure has three essential steps: disinfecting the root canal (i. e. triple antibiotic paste (TAP) or double antibiotic paste (DAP)), provoking bleeding inside the canal to form a scaffold upon which pulp stem cells will be deposited and continue root growth, and creating a good coronal seal. Previous research has reported that antibiotic pastes (TAP and DAP) are cytotoxic to stem cells in the concentrations commonly used in endodontic regeneration (1000 mg/mL). To decrease the adverse effects on stem cells and increase the rate of success of the regeneration, defining appropriate antibiotic concentrations for ERP is critical. In this project, five in-vitro experiments were conducted to determine the breakpoint dilutions of both TAP and DAP <b>medicaments,</b> and to prepare a suitable novel pastes containing diluted TAP or DAP <b>medicaments</b> for ERP. In the first experiment, we compared the antibacterial effect of TAP, and DAP against early biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria. In the second study, we investigated the antibacterial effect of various dilutions of TAP and DAP antibiotic <b>medicaments</b> against established E. faecalis biofilm. In the third experiment, we investigated longitudinally the residual antibacterial activity of human radicular dentin treated with 1000, 1 or 0. 5 mg/ml of TAP and DAP. In the fourth study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of various dilutions of TAP and DAP antibiotic <b>medicaments</b> on the survival of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSC). And in the fifth experiment, we investigated the antibacterial and cytotoxic effect of novel intracanal <b>medicaments</b> consisting of methylcellulose (MC) and/or propylene glycol (PG) mixed with 1 mg/ml of TAP or DAP. 1 mg/ml of DAP or TAP <b>medicaments</b> had a significant antibacterial effect against early bacterial biofilm formation, and established bacterial biofilm. Furthermore, 1 mg/ml had a residual antibacterial activity comparable to 1000 mg/ml. The novel intracanal <b>medicaments</b> had comparable antibacterial effect to currently used <b>medicaments</b> (1000 mg/ml). Additionally, the novel intracanal <b>medicaments</b> significantly enhanced DPSC metabolic activity, compared to currently used <b>medicaments</b> in endodontic regeneration procedures...|$|R

Let the subject of inquiry be, the conditions of health and disease in the human body; or (for greater simplicity) the conditions of recovery from a given disease; and in order to narrow the question still more, let it be limited, in the first instance, to this one inquiry: Is, or is not, some particular <b>medicament</b> (mercury, for instance) a remedy for the given disease.|$|E

6000|$|It {{follows that}} in order to deal {{intelligently}} with the criminal impulse in our afflicted fellow-citizens we must discover the bacillus of crime. To that end I think that the bodies of hanged assassins and such persons of low degree as have been gathered to their fathers by the cares of public office or consumed by the rust of inactivity in prison should be handed over to the microscopists for examination. The bore, too, offers a fine field for research, and might justly enough be examined alive. Whether there is one general--or as the ancient and honorable orders prefer to say, [...] "grand"--bacillus, producing a general (or grand) criminal impulse covering a multitude of sins, or an infinite number of well defined and several bacilli, each inciting to a particular crime, is a question to the determination of which the most distinguished microscopist might be proud to devote the powers of his eye. If the latter is the case it will somewhat complicate the treatment, for clearly the patient afflicted with chronic robbery will require medicines different from those that might be efficacious in a gentleman suffering from constitutional theft or the desire to represent his District in the Assembly.

The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the clinical features and common allergens of contact dermatitis to topical <b>medicaments</b> in Taiwan. MethodsFrom 1978 to 2005, a total of 3717 patients had been patch tested in our Contact Dermatitis Clinic. Any case with suspected contact allergy to topical <b>medicaments</b> receiving patch testing was included in this study. ResultsDuring this period, a total of 608 patients were included and 603 of them completed the patch tests. Of the 603 patch-tested patients, 397 (66 %) were positive for at least one antigen, and all patch tests were negative in 206 (34 %). Patients with positive patch testing were characterized by younger age and location on the limbs and skin folds, while sex and atopy were not different among the two groups. A total of 1076 positive reactions to identifiable <b>medicaments</b> or main ingredients were recorded in 397 patients with positive patch testing.

So he sighed and spoke no more. The medicine, whatever it might be, had the merit, rare in doctor's stuff, of being pleasant to take, assuasive of thirst, and imbued with a hardly perceptible fragrance, that was so ethereal that it also seemed to enter into his dream and modify it.

60|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).--This whale, {{among the}} English of old vaguely {{known as the}} Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest {{inhabitant}} of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, {{by far the most}} valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and <b>medicament.</b> It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.|$|E
