5000|$|Losers is a {{play about}} middle aged lovers, Hanna and Andy, {{who are trying to}} make a {{relationship}} while having Hanna's mother, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Wilson,</b> and Cissy, next door neighbour, watching them constantly. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Cissy are very Catholic and do not think it is appropriate for Hanna's and Andy's relationship to continue. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Wilson</b> tries to break up their relationship by constantly ringing her bell, and wanting prayers. Towards {{the end of the play}} Andy comes home drunk and taunts <b>Mrs</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Andy that they're [...] "Heads a marly" [...] - a reference to the Saint Philomena whom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Wilson</b> is devout to. With this action Hanna proclaims [...] "you'll regret this day Andy Tracey, you'll regret this day as long as you live". In the end Andy and Hanna are still together, however, they are stuck in a loveless marriage - divorce was frowned upon at the time - making them the Losers of the play.|$|R

Meanwhile, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> storms off as she finds out the Brigitte is actually Michel's new wife. As the women leave, Michel's office calls back and he realizes it was just a ruse that the Prince called, and he knows Brigitte is lying.|$|R

25|$|Dennis the Menace {{has been}} the subject of a number of adaptations. The first one {{produced}} is a CBS sitcom that aired from 1959 to 1963 starring Jay North as Dennis, Herbert Anderson as Henry Mitchell and father to Dennis; Joseph Kearns as George Wilson, and subsequently Gale Gordon as his brother, John Wilson. North also appeared as Dennis on an episode of The Donna Reed Show and in the theatrical film Pepe (both 1960). In 1987, a Dennis the Menace live-action television film was released; it was later re-released on video under the title Dennis the Menace: Dinosaur Hunter. Another live-action Dennis the Menace film, starring Walter Matthau as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Mason Gamble as Dennis, was released to theaters in 1993. It was originally titled The Real Dennis the Menace before the final name was approved. This was followed with the direct-to-video Dennis the Menace Strikes Again in 1998, starring Don Rickles as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson.</b> The most recent film adaptation, A Dennis the Menace Christmas was released to DVD on November 6, 2007. The Warner Bros. production starred Robert Wagner as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson,</b> Louise Fletcher as Mrs. Wilson, and Maxwell Perry Cotton, a six-year-old actor, as Dennis.|$|E

25|$|Petitioners {{allege that}} Novak's July 14, 2003 column {{publicly}} disclosed Ms. Wilson's covert CIA employment {{and that that}} disclosure 'destroyed her cover as a classified CIA employee'. Petitioners, however, allege that Novak's source was Armitage, and do not allege {{that any of the}} three defendants against whom <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> presses his First Amendment claim-Cheney, Rove, and Libby-caused that column to be published. In the absence of factual allegations that Mr. Wilson's alleged injury from the public disclosure of his wife's CIA employment is 'fairly traceable' to alleged conduct by Cheney, Rove, or Libby, petitioners have failed to establish Article III jurisdiction over Mr. Wilson's First Amendment claim.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} plaintiffs' claims pose {{important}} questions {{relating to the}} propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials. Defendants' motions, however, raise issues that the Court is obliged to address before it can consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims. As it turns out, the Court will not reach, and therefore expresses no views on, {{the merits of the}} constitutional and other tort claims asserted by plaintiffs based on defendants' alleged disclosures because the motions to dismiss will be granted...The alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson's comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory. But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged tortious conduct, namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental to the kind of conduct that defendants were employed to perform.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the voyage}} to the United States, the ship (reputedly called the Wolf) was {{overtaken}} over by pirates who threatened to loot {{the ship and}} sink it with all on board. When the pirate captain heard the cry of an infant, he went below to discover <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> holding her newborn daughter. The pirate captain told <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> that if she would do him the honor of naming the baby after his own mother Mary, he would spare the ship and depart peacefully. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> agreed, and the pirates departed, but not before the pirate captain briefly returned to the Wolf with a bolt of green brocade silk, which he presented to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson,</b> stating that it was for little Mary's wedding gown. While Mary did in fact wear the brocade on her wedding day, she {{may not have been}} the first to do so, as when her mother remarried the cloth may have been used on that occasion as well.|$|R
60|$|The {{substance}} of the foregoing narrative was related by Mrs. Fitzgerald to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson,</b> who repeated it to Emily in their ride home. The compassion of both ladies was strongly moved in behalf of the young widow; yet <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> did not fail {{to point out to}} her niece the consequences of deception, and chiefly the misery which had followed from an abandonment of some of the primary duties of life--obedience and respect to her parent Emily, though keenly alive to all the principles inculcated by her aunt, found so much to be pitied in the fate of her friend, that her failings lost their proper appearance in her eyes, and for a while she could think of nothing but Julia and her misfortunes. Previously to their leaving the cottage, Mrs. Fitzgerald, with glowing cheeks and some hesitation, informed <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> she had yet another important communication to make, but would postpone it until her next visit, which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wilson</b> promised should be on the succeeding day.|$|R

25|$|Series 8 and 9 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{running a}} Bed & Breakfast {{hotel in the}} fictional seaside town of Puddleford (location filming for series 8 and 9 took place around Brighton). Various guests stayed at the hotel {{over the course of}} the two series and again Bodger kept Badger's presence a secret from all of them. Guests included two Spanish flamenco dancers, Miss Peake (a bad-tempered school teacher), Mr Tucknott (a dim-witted bank manager), the bubbly Mrs Bobbins, Miss Piper (a mad old woman) and <b>Mr</b> <b>Wilson</b> (a pathetic trainee bank manager). In Series 8 the characters of Millie the Milkwoman and China the dog were introduced, who featured in the show until the very end. Millie was friends with Bodger and knew about Badger, as he was friends with her dog, China. Series 8 also featured the return of Mr Smart, as he ran the B next door to Bodger's. Smart never seemed to have any guests staying at his hotel and was always trying to steal Bodger's. This was the first series to utilise the 1997 BBC logo and the last series to use the pink background for its title card and end credits.|$|E
500|$|Barry X. Miller {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Library Journal, and wrote [...] "Wilson's text is a surfeit of saccharine Goobers and gooey Ju Ju Bees, empty calories but fun to eat." [...] Miller compared to the book to Golden Turkey Awards and The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Miller commented that Wilson provides [...] "a wonderfully droll review" [...] for each film entry in the book. Ben Steelman of the Wilmington Star-News called the book a [...] "handy volume", and commented [...] "in loving detail, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> describes his 100favorites among the Worst Movies Ever Made", David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that Wilson discusses [...] "his take on the 100 most awful—yet perversely fun—movies to watch".

500|$|The Parliamentary {{leader of}} the {{opposition}} Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new Prime Minister as [...] "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families.

After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!" [...] Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, [...] "I suppose <b>Mr</b> <b>Wilson,</b> when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson." [...] He called Wilson [...] "this slick salesman of synthetic science" [...] and the Labour party [...] "the only relic of class consciousness in the country". The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that [...] "The Labour Party is not interested {{in the fact that the}} new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1809 {{historian}} John Eliot called Wilson affable in speech, but condescending in his deportment. [...] An early mentor of his, Dr. William Ames, wrote, [...] "that if {{he might}} have his option of the best condition this side of heaven, it would be [...] the teacher of a congregational church of which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> was pastor." [...] Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton called him [...] "eminent for love and zeal" [...] and M'Clure wrote that his unfeigning modesty was excessive. [...] In this vein, M'Clure wrote that Wilson refused to ever sit for a portrait and his response to those who suggested he do so was [...] "What! Such a poor vile creature as I am! [...] Shall my picture be drawn? [...] I say No; it never shall." [...] M'Clure then suggested that the line drawing of Wilson in the Massachusetts Historical Society was made after his death. [...] Cotton Mather, the noted Puritan who was a grandson of both Richard Mather and John Cotton wrote of Wilson, [...] "If the picture of this good, and therein great man, were to be exactly given, great zeal, with great love, would be the two principal strokes that, joined with orthodoxy, should make up his portraiture." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Everett Wilson, Sr. — Dennis's cranky, cantankerous, middle-aged next-door neighbor; {{a retired}} postal carrier and (at {{least as far}} as Dennis is concerned) his best adult friend. Dennis likes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> but unintentionally annoys him, as he {{regularly}} disrupts Mr. Wilson's attempts at a serene, quiet life. Dennis often interrupts Mr. Wilson's hobbies such as gardening, as well as coin and stamp collecting, at times accidentally damaging his property. As a result, the gruff old retiree displays a less than cordial attitude towards the young boy, though Dennis continues his well-meaning intrusions unabated. Actually, as many readers suspected, he is secretly fond of Dennis and misses him when he's away — although he'd never openly admit it. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> is named after a teacher Hank Ketcham knew. Dennis will often (especially in the TV series) refer to him as [...] "Good Ol' Mr. Wilson". Although a running gag is that Dennis's pranks drive <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> crazy, there are times when Dennis tries to do something nice for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson,</b> such as the time Dennis left Ruff the dog and Hot Dog the cat with <b>Mr</b> <b>Wilson</b> so he wouldn't be lonely on Father's Day, while Dennis and his father went to a baseball game, or the time Dennis tries to cheer <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wilson</b> up on April Fool's day by placing a fake [...] "Mitchell House for sale" [...] sign up.
