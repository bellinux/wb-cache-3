The <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> {{is an important component}} of hard disk drive which is used for reading and writing data in to the media. Thin film of metal alloys and metal oxides are fabricated on ceramic substrate called wafer to create the recording heads. In order to control surface properties of the recording head, the precise chemical mechanical nano grinding process is used. In this process the recording heads are treated to archive the designed surface properties by using lubricants to control the selectivity of material removal. This research studied the effect of additives in ethylene glycol based lubricant on the selectivity of material removal. Two additives were added in ethylene glycol to create the lubricant and their pHs were measured. The material removal rate can be predicted by measuring wettability of lubricant on surface of material. Nickel iron alloy (NiFe) was used to represent the surface material of magnetic shield of the recording head. The wettability of lubricants were measured on NiFe surface by contact angle measurement technique to show the selectivity on each NiFe. The results were compared with the atomic force micrograph of material after lapping process and show that the selective removal of material can be occurred by this method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Exchange coupled {{composite}} (ECC) {{media has}} been shown to possess several major advantages relative to conventional perpendicular media, including a reduction in the switching field of approximately a factor two for the same thermal stability and greater insensitivity to easy axis distribution. In this paper, full magnetostatic interactions are included: this allows comparison between the behavior of multigrain thin films and that of isolated grains as presented earlier. Significant results include hysteresis loops for thin films under various conditions including inadequate and excessive intra granular exchange between the hard and soft materials. An important distinction is made between the coercivity and remnant coercivity as a function of angle between applied field and easy axis.
