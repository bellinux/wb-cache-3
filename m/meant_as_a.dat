5|$|One dodo was {{reportedly}} sent {{as far as}} Nagasaki, Japan in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|The joke in {{the episode}} about Fox Mulder's {{predicted}} death being by autoerotic asphyxiation {{was inspired by}} previous jokes in the series about Mulder's interest in pornography. It was also inspired by a book Morgan had read on homicide investigations. While Morgan noted that he hypothesized {{that might be a}} way that Mulder would die, the line was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> joke.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E

5|$|The role of Mahmud {{was filled}} when Balink {{was out with}} coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome– as he {{expected}} for the role– driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which {{he and his family}} had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to draw a higher-class audience.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E
5000|$|Domenico Guerri {{researched}} medieval glossaries thoroughly in 1908, {{and interpreted}} it as [...] "Oh Satan, oh Satan, God", {{which he wrote}} was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> invocation against travellers.|$|R

25|$|In May 2014, Wyatt {{released}} her first EP titled Ke'Ke', through The NorthStar Group {{and her own}} imprint Aratek Entertainment. The imprint is her birth name backwards, and is also <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stand-in for the word erotic.|$|E
25|$|Around 1985, Hudson Soft {{released}} the credit card-sized Bee Card, which was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cheaper and more convenient alternative to ROM cartridges. But {{it was a}} commercial failure, and very few titles were released on the format.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Iacocca co-authored (with Sonny Kleinfeld) Talking Straight, a book <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{counterbalance}} to Akio Morita's Made in Japan, a non-fiction book praising Japan's post-war hard-working culture.

25|$|Some filmed {{scenes were}} cut during editing. One such {{involved}} the character Burt Gervasi telling Silvio Dante {{that he has}} begun cooperating with the Lupertazzi family, a scene that was <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> setup for the murder that ended up as the episode's opening.|$|E
25|$|On May Day 2015, an art {{installation}} by Italian Davide Dormino titled Anything to Say? {{was placed}} in Berlin's Alexanderplatz.

25|$|The {{school has}} a ceiling of 195 {{enrolments}} in 2007 as compared to numbers close to 70 in 1994. With this expansion has come the need to install demountables.

25|$|Quebec City {{was founded}} in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. Some other towns were founded before, most famously Tadoussac in 1604 which still exists today, but Quebec {{was the first to}} be <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} settlement and not a simple trading post. Over time, it became the capital of Canada and all of New France.|$|E
25|$|Will Wright {{has also}} stated that The Sims was {{actually}} <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> satire of U.S. consumer culture.
