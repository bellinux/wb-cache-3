40|$|A new {{nanocomposite}} magnet containing exchange-coupled SmFe 3 and alpha-Fe phases {{has been}} successfully fabricated via melt spinning followed by <b>magnetic</b> <b>annealing</b> at 450 - 470 degrees C for 10 min. These SmFe 3 /alpha-Fe magnets show remarkably high remanent ratio, M-r/M-s, up to 0. 93 and display a smooth single-phase-like loop with excellent rectangularity. In comparison, the non-field treated ones exhibit much lower M-r/M-s values and show a distinctive kink in the demagnetization curve due to the decoupling of the nanograins.
