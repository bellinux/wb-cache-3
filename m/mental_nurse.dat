40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{present the}} {{findings}} of a systematic review on (1) the attitudes of undergraduate <b>nursing</b> students towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> and (2) the influence of undergraduate nursing education on the attitudes of undergraduate <b>nursing</b> students towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing.</b> Background. Recruitment and retention of <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> is challenging. Undergraduate nursing students’ attitudes towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> may influence whether they choose to practice in this specialty upon graduation. Design. A systematic review. Method. Searches of the CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycINFO electronic databases returned 1400 records, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria for this review. A further four papers were obtained through scanning the reference lists of those articles included from the initial literature search. Results. Research on the attitudes of undergraduate <b>nursing</b> students towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> has consistently shown that mental health is one of the least preferred areas of nursing for a potential career. With respect to the influence of undergraduate nursing education on the attitudes of students towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing,</b> quasi-experimental studies have generally demonstrated that students tended to have more favourable attitudes towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> when they had received more hours of theoretical preparation and undertaken longer clinical placements. Conclusion. Many <b>nursing</b> students regard <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> as the least preferred career option. Education, via classroom teaching and clinical placements, seems to engender more positive attitudes towards <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing.</b> There is no evidence, however, that changing student attitudes results in more graduates beginning careers in <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing.</b> Reference to clinical practice. The constancy of negative attitudes to <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> over time suggests the focus of research should shift.

40|$|Examining the {{relations}} between the rise of scientific psychiatry and the emergence of mental health nursing in Dutch asylums, this study analyses the social relationships of class, gender and religion that structured asylum care in the Netherlands around 1900. Drawing on archival collections of four Dutch asylums, the book highlights the gendered nature of mental health nursing politics. Seeking to model the asylum after the forceful example of the general hospital, psychiatrists introduced new somatic treatments and designed <b>mental</b> <b>nurse</b> training which aimed at creating a nursing staff skilled in somatic care. The training system, based on the projected image of the civilized, middle-class female nurse, bringing competence and compassion to the care of the mentally ill, created new opportunities for women, {{while at the same time}} restricting the role of men in nursing. Capturing the contradictory realities of hospital-oriented asylum care, the book illustrates the social complexity of the care of the mentally ill and forms an important addition to the historiography on European psychiatry...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the emergence of}} mental health nursing in late-nineteenth-century Dutch society as a medical and a social change. The manuscript collections of four psychiatric hospitals form the primary source material. Mental health nursing evolved {{within the context of}} the rise of scientific psychiatry, which emphasized organic origins of mental illness. Psychiatrists modeled the asylum after the successful example of the general hospital. They introduced new somatic treatments and designed a <b>mental</b> <b>nurse</b> training system which aimed at creating a nursing staff skilled in somatic care. This created new opportunities for women, while at the same time restricting the role of men in nursing. The projected image of the civilized, bourgeois female nurse was in stark contrast with the actual make-up of the hospital staff, which largely consisted of inexperienced pupil-nurses of modest background. Organic explanations for mental illness and somatic care turned out to be a weak foundation and a poor match for the day-to-day reality of asylum care. The work of mental health nurses remained predominantly custodial while the rudimentary training which nurses received left them largely unprepared for their work. In fact, these problems contributed to the therapeutic failure of hospital-oriented asylum care. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} form of an {{investigation}} into the lack of progress towards the professionalisation of <b>mental</b> <b>nurses</b> during the period 1850 to 1950 and concentrates on their failure to become a professional sub-group within nursing. The proposal is put forward that their relative failure to advance was {{due to the fact that}} <b>mental</b> <b>nurses</b> were controlled and dominated by other more powerful health care groups with their own agendas. These were the asylum doctors in the (Royal) Medico-Psychological Association ((R) MPA), and the doctors and general trained nurses in the General Nursing Council (GNC). During the 1850 s the (R) MPA's main concern was to raise the status of asylum doctors. The association aimed to achieve this by developing the care and treatment of the insane into another recognised speciality of medicine. To do this they needed to hospitalise the asylums, a process which would include transforming asylum attendants into qualified <b>mental</b> <b>nurses.</b> To this end a <b>mental</b> <b>nursing</b> textbook was published by the (R) MPA in 1885. This was followed by the inauguration of a national training scheme with certification for successful candidates. In order to advance the goal of hospitalisation, female nurses were introduced into male wards in many asylums. It was also asserted that the care of insane male patients was improved, a claim which led to conflicts with the trade unions, which were totally opposed to female nurses on male wards. The impact of unionisation of <b>mental</b> <b>nurses</b> will also be discussed in relationship to the struggle for professionalisation. Even when the Nurses' Registration Act 1919 was passed, <b>mental</b> <b>nurses</b> were caught in the middle of an internecine conflict over who controlled them: on one side was the GNC with its new supplementary register for mental nurses; on the other stood the (R) MPA, reluctant to give up their training and examination scheme under the conditions offered by the GNC. So a dual system of registration continued to exist until the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948. Even then <b>mental</b> <b>nursing</b> was still controlled by the general trained dominated GNC...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{enhance the}} {{understanding}} of the skills and attitudes of <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> working in the Australian <b>Mental</b> Health <b>Nurse</b> Incentive Program. Background. The <b>Mental</b> Health <b>Nurse</b> Incentive Program places qualified <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> alongside community-based general practitioners, private psychiatric practices and other appropriate organisations to provide clients with mental health conditions with a more integrated treatment plan. Design. An exploratory, qualitative approach was undertaken, given the paucity of relevant research in this area. Methods. Exploratory individual interviews were conducted with ten <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> working in this scheme. Data analysis was organised and managed using QSR NVivo qualitative analysis software. Results. Respondents identified specific skills and attitudes required for practice under the <b>Mental</b> Health <b>Nurse</b> Incentive Program. Eight areas of skill and attitude were identified as essential for <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> working in this field. This study highlights that many of these skills and attitudes are specific to the setting where <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> are working.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{grew out}} of my experiences {{while working as a}} <b>mental</b> <b>nurse</b> with people deemed to be insane. The behaviours which they presented and the medical and legal control exercised over them became of concern to me because I felt their rights were not being respected. A primary issue {{is the extent to which}} adherence to the medical-somatic view of insanity held by psychiatrists, lawyers and politicians has led to the exclusion of viable custody and treatment alternatives. The purpose of this research is to question the role and functions of mental nurses. It suggests that 'caretakers' might be a more suitable title for such workers with the insane. The hypothesis underlying the research links the work of 'caretakers' of the insane to changes in government policies and legislation; the thesis examines this hypothesis in the light of changes in the roles and functions of 'caretakers' over the period from 1890 to 1990. Research activities included the examination of primary sources, Hansard, newspapers, and professional journals. Interviews were also carried out with nine contemporary caretakers who have worked with the 1959 and the 1983 Mental Health Acts. These research methods provided an historical background to the debates in the Houses of Parliament when mental health legislation was discussed; information from the writings of the professionals who worked with the insane at the times of new mental health legislation; data on the public and media debate of these issues; and information on the perceptions and duties of caretakers working with the insane at the times of new mental health legislation. The research findings show that both those who cared for the insane and the insane themselves have been subjected to changes brought about by mental health legislation since 1890. These changes affected the working conditions of the caretakers and the social control and rights of the insane. The changes in the work of caretakers led to new directions in their education. Workers with the insane became a part of nursing by adopting the somatic approach to care. When this occurred, many of the care activities of keepers, attendants and mental nurses became redundant. Over time, there has been a move to, and then away from, the clinical-somatic model of nursing towards caretaking skills such as group work, therapeutic community skills, counselling skills and psychotherapy skills. These caretaking skills are seen by contemporary caretakers as going beyond their custodial and social control functions, towards providing a space in which people can be respected, encouraged, supported and be open to new insights...|$|E

40|$|Background & Aim: It seems {{cost-effective}} {{to provide}} {{mental health care}} to patient with mild mental problems in general practices instead of in specialized care, but general practitioners (GPs) often lack time or expertise. Since 2008, Dutch GPs have been collaborating with <b>nurses</b> with <b>mental</b> health expertise. <b>Mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> perform diagnostic tests and provide short term care. It is not clear yet if <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> replace GP care, or if they provide additional care. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate a possible transition of care from GPs to <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses.</b> Method: in an observational study, we analyzed consultation data routinely recorded in Dutch general practices participating in NIVEL Primary Care Database (NIVEL-PCD) between 2010 and 2014. We used multilevel regression models to analyze consultations for mental problems at GPs and <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses.</b> We compared consultations for mental problems between general practices with and without <b>mental</b> health <b>nurse.</b> Results: Increasing numbers of Dutch general practices collaborate with a mental health nurse; from 20 % in 2010 to 83 % in 2014. Increasing numbers of patients have at least one consultation for mental problems in general practice. <b>Mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> most often provide care to adult, female patients with common psychological symptoms, during on average three long consultations. GPs working in practices with a <b>mental</b> health <b>nurse</b> treat slightly more patients with mental problems than GPs without a <b>mental</b> health <b>nurse</b> (OR= 1. 05; 95 %CI= 1. 02 - 1. 08), but they use comparable numbers of consultations per patient. Conclusions: <b>Mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> do not seem to replace GP care, but mainly provide additional consultations to patients with mental problems. Collaboration with a <b>mental</b> health <b>nurse</b> may increase GPs’ skills to recognize mental problems.

40|$|Identity {{studies are}} well {{established}} across {{the social science}} literature with <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> beginning to offer evidenced insights into what may, or may not, constitute key identity performances. For <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> these performances remain contested, both from within the profession and from international contexts that favour generic constructions of mental health. This paper offers findings from a qualitative study that focused upon the process of how <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> identity development is influenced, rather than what that identity {{may or may not}} be. These findings highlight that <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> (MHNs) not only form their identity around service user centred education and training, but that many also use the education as a means to leave the profession. Through highlighting the impact of informal education (i. e., through work), formal education, and training upon the formation of <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> identity, nurses are potentially alerted to the importance of clinically focussed mental health being prominent within curricula, rewarding <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> skills specialisation, and the importance {{of the role of the}} service user in <b>mental</b> health <b>nurse</b> education and, hence, identity formation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although mental {{disorders}} {{is of great}} public health concern among Kenyan populations, mental health services remain poor. Some of the reasons attributed to delivery of poor mental health services are unfavourable work environment and lack of policy guidelines including a conceptual model of <b>nursing.</b> Quality of <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> care significantly impacts on general mental health services in Kenya since they are predominantly provided by nurses. Lack of a model to guide care and improve mental health services created {{the need to develop}} the Kenyan Human Interaction Model for <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> practice. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover and develop a Kenyan model for <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> guided by two research questions, namely: What are the views of Kenyan <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> with regards to human being, environment, <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> and <b>mental</b> health: What is the appropriate model for <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> practice in Kenya? Methodology: Straussian Grounded Theory method was used in the study. Data were collected for 6 months through in-depth interviews with 33 registered <b>mental</b> health <b>nurses</b> selected by open, purposive and theoretical sampling methods. Inductive and deductive data analysis of the nurses' description of their views and recommendations on the nursing metaparadigms were done Findings: A substantive theory of the Kenyan Human Interaction Model for <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> practice was developed. The four metaparadigm concepts of the discovered theory are: 1. Human being as a unique biopsychosocio-spiritual being and causal condition 2. Environment consisting of homely and hostile dimensions 3. <b>Mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> as a holistic care founded on human interaction 4. Mental health (consequence of holistic care) with optimum and illness dimensions. <b>Mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> was discovered as the central phenomena interacting with its causal, contexts and intervening conditions to determine the mental health dimension of the human being. The quality of <b>mental</b> health <b>nursing</b> determines the <b>mental</b> health dimensions and is influenced by the environment and nurses' characteristics as contexts and intervening conditions respectively. These interactions lead to consequences discovered as optimum mental health.
