5000|$|K-PAX {{is seated}} {{far from the}} two stars it orbits: K-MON and K-RIL. Thus, K-PAXians {{experience}} an eternal dusk as K-PAX orbits in a helix around the two celestial bodies. These stars are also not like the Sun {{because they are not}} main sequence stars. From the descriptions in the novel it is assumed that they are protostars nearing their inevitable collapse. The constant phase shift of light on K-PAX and the lack of light made it necessary to evolve the ability to detect shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., ultraviolet. This explains prot's need to wear his sunglasses in all but very dim conditions. In the book, when Prot is questioned as to why a K-PAXian appears human on Earth, he responds, [...] "Why is a soap bubble round?" [...] He explains that K-PAXians appear human because the humanoid form is the most efficient shape to explore the planet. The method of reproduction of the dremers (prot's species, a term used in the book), unlike human sexual intercourse, is considered extremely unpleasant, due to intense feelings of pain and horrible smells, among other unpleasant sensations. Prot is completely uninterested in flirtation. Prot can age to a thousand years, like his parents, who are in their late six-hundreds. Prot's age contributes to his knowledge base, and on Earth, prot is considered a savant, although it is never specified whether dremer intelligence is inherent or a result of K-PAXian society. Prot makes it clear that dremers <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> to improve and disseminate their understanding of truth. Prot ultimately communicates that sentient beings on K-PAX have such a universal awareness of life that it would seem a majority of human endeavor is benign, but he is excited for us because our race has a bright future if only we disregard our primitive misconceptions of our surroundings.|$|E

30|$|This {{means that}} {{learning}} will always proceed as learners {{as well as}} their teachers, peers, and parents continuously assess what has already been learned, what can be learned, and what will have to wait to be learned. Therefore, in a learner-centered classroom, assessment is a constant process. The teacher <b>makes</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> to move beyond summative assessment, which only focuses on learners’ achievement after experiencing some instruction. The focus is shifted to the process of learning whereby assessment occurs continuously and formatively while the learner is still learning (Stiggins 2002).

Admittedly assessment of learning will always remain an essential component of learning as it can show whether the learning objectives have been achieved. However, it should not be the only form of assessment that is practiced.|$|R
50|$|The film YMCA Baseball takes places {{after these}} events have {{occurred}} and Japan has occupied Korea as a protectorate state of Japan. The Japanese have a highly invested interest in maintaining control of Korea and <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> to prohibit any inkling of resistance or possibility of uprising by the Korean people as portrayed {{by the film}} although somewhat overly exuberant. Korea’s future lay uncertain and coincided with national sentiment of oppression towards the Japanese. With the Chosun dynasty ending and large western and other foreign influence there were two sentiments shared among the Korea people. Korea could either modernize or {{go back to the}} traditional ways of its historic past. Westerners and Japanese had made settlements in Korea; Missionary schools and military outposts respectively, and took full advantage of the fact Korea {{was in the midst of}} the twilight of its greatest dynasty, the Chosen. With the West to traveling and settling Asia, western culture and customs spread in turn. As the film’s title states, YMCA baseball was a part of this divergence. George Williams founded the YMCA on June 6, 1844, in London, England; YMCA is an acronym for Young Men’s Christian Association that began among evangelists. Known for its promotion of sports, it was actually also a missionary organization in conjunction with the Church and run locally and this would most likely have been encouraged even as far away as Korea. Baseball was first introduced in Korea in 1905 by Phillip L. Gillett, a missionary who introduced the sport to members of a YMCA in Seoul. Western missionaries of the YMCA colluded with the Japanese to abolish traditional Korean values and indoctrinate Korean youths to Japanese values and customs. This led many Koreans to study in Tokyo and this is represented by a few characters in the film. Indoctrination of the youth would steer Korea in the direction of modernization; Japan had been undergoing a surge of industrial production and western adoption and the West had already gone through several phases of industrialization. By subverting the youth of Korea to fall in line with more modern and foreign sentiments, in a way ensured the future relations with Korea and the inevitable outcome of this is a struggle between traditional Korean culture and values, and that of new influence. The remark about the Japanese first encountering baseball some thirty years earlier however, was accurate (1872).|$|E

Factors such as product characteristics, product pricing, and compatibility protection strategies must interact properly for green innovation to be sustainable. <br /...|$|E

It is done by {{establishing}} two objectives: the first is analyzing the movie based on its structural elements {{and the second is}} analyzing the movie based on the Individual Psychological Perspective. This research is qualitative research. Type of data of the study is text and image taken from two data sources: primary and secondary.

While the secondary data sources are other materials taken from books, journals, and internet related to the study. Both data are collected through library research and analyzed by descriptive analysis. The study comes to the following conclusions. Firstly, based on the structural analysis, it is apparent that in this movie, Nick Cassavetes as the director conveys a moral message that “A mother tends to do anything {{to save the life of}} her child”. It shows that the characters and characterization, plot, setting, point of view, theme, mise en scene, cinematography, sound, editing and casting are related to each other and form the unity into a good quality of movie.
