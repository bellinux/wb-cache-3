25|$|A chimera is an {{ordinary}} person or animal except {{that some of}} their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother.

The number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another, and often leads to characteristic mosaicism skin coloration in human chimeras. A chimera may be intersex, composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin. In one case DNA tests determined that a woman, mystifyingly, was not the mother of two of her three children; she was found to be a chimera, and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin.|$|E

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{study of}} <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> is a {{valuable}} method for distinguishing the genetic and environmental etiologic factors. The {{purpose of this study}} was comparison between occlusal indices and dental arch dimensions in <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins.</b> Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was preformed on 40 <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> that their permanent teeth were fully erupted. The variables that were evaluated in this study included: overjet, overbite, molar relationship, canine relationship, anterior circumference of dental arch, total circumference of dental arch, inter canine width, inter molar width. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (the pair t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient). Results: According to pair t-test all the variables had P value more than 0. 05. The amount of correlation coefficient of overbite (r= 0. 907) was greater than the other variables and overjet (r= 0. 408) was minimum. Conclusion: The occlusal indices and dental arch dimensions in <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> were compared and mostly influenced by genetics factors.

50|$|In {{the case}} of twins, dichorionic placentation refers to the {{presence}} of two placentas (in all dizygotic and some <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins).</b> Monochorionic placentation occurs when <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> develop with only one placenta and bears a higher risk of complications during pregnancy. Abnormal placentation can lead to an early termination of pregnancy, for example in pre-eclampsia.|$|R
5000|$|Monochorionic {{twins are}} {{monozygotic}} (identical) twins that {{share the same}} placenta. If the placenta is shared by more than two twins (see multiple birth), these are monochorionic multiples. Monochorionic twins occur in 0.3% of all pregnancies. 75% of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pregnancies are monochorionic; the remaining 25% are dichorionic diamniotic.

50|$|In normal <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> development, one egg is fertilized by {{a single}} sperm. The egg will then {{completely}} split into two, normally at the two-cell stage. If the egg splits in the early blastocyst stage, two inner cell masses will be present, eventually leading to the twins sharing the same chorion and placenta, but with separate amnions. However, the egg can split into two, but still have one blastocyst. This will lead to one inner cell mass and one blastocyst. Then, as the twins develop, they will share the same placenta, chorion, and amnion.

50|$|Another {{study in}} 2007 {{investigated}} {{the differences in}} brain structure between two adult, <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> females. One underwent chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, while the other did not have cancer and was not treated with chemotherapy. MRI scans were taken of both twins' brain while {{taking part in a}} working memory task. Results found that twin A (exposed to chemotherapy) experienced a broader spatial extent of activation in her brain than twin B (not exposed to chemotherapy). Twin A also reported a greater difficulty than twin B in completing the memory activity. The authors of this study declare that commonly chemotherapy patients will self-report cognitive complaints, although they perform within normal limits on neuropsychological tasks. MRI scans may provide evidence for this occurrence. Chemotherapy patients may require greater volume of neural circuitry to complete neuropsychological tasks compared to others.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the clear {{phenotypic}} variability is a <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> study conducted by Jobling et al. (2010). Two monozygotic female twins had the same IRF6 mutation; however Twin A {{was born with a}} bilateral cleft lip, whereas Twin B had bilateral lip pits and no orofacial clefting. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. The twins' father had lip pits alone and a family history of CLP, CP, CL, and/or lip pits. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was done for all exons of IRF6, and a missense mutation was discovered in exon 4. The tyrosine in the normal protein at this position is conserved across mammals, frogs, and chickens, so {{despite the fact that it}} was a previously unreported mutation, it was expected to be deleterious. This study is not the first case of different phenotypes occurring between monozygotic twins. Possible causes of phenotypic variability include variations in the intrauterine environment, epigenetic differences, or chance effects.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{issue is}} the recent finding that even <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> can be {{different}} {{and there is a}} mechanism which might account for <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> being discordant for homosexuality. Gringas and Chen (2001) describe a number of mechanisms which can lead to differences between <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins,</b> the most relevant here being chorionicity and amniocity. Dichorionic twins potentially have different hormonal environments because they receive maternal blood from separate placenta, and this could result in different levels of brain masculinisation.
