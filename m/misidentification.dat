5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to be mistaken for other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional <b>misidentification</b> occurred when the M.nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|P. labiata {{is one of}} 17 {{species in}} the genus Portia as of May 2011. This species has been named Sinis fimbriatus (Hasselt, 1882; <b>misidentification),</b> Linus labiatus (Thorell, 1887), Linus dentipalpis (Thorell, 1890), Erasinus dentipalpis (Thorell, 1892), Erasinus labiatus (Simon, 1903) and Portia labiata (Wanless, 1978), and the last name has been used since then.|$|E
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a <b>misidentification</b> of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} assigned Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 9, but on 1 August {{it was given}} the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and it had its Victor number changed to 89 to avoid <b>misidentification</b> with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. Its nose art was painted after the Nagasaki mission. The name purportedly referred to the talents of the bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, with both the Norden bombsight and with women.|$|E
5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is a vulnerable species whereas C. herbacea is much more common. This has previously led to the <b>misidentification</b> of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis. There is a smooth lip running only half {{the length of the}} ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on C. graminis.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on it after the mission, was a pun on {{the name of the}} aircraft commander. It left Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid <b>misidentification</b> with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In botany, {{although}} a synonym {{must be a}} formally accepted scientific name (a validly published name): a listing of [...] "synonyms", a [...] "synonymy", often contains designations that for some reason {{did not make it}} as a formal name, such as manuscript names, or even <b>misidentifications</b> (although it is now the usual practice to list <b>misidentifications</b> separately).|$|R
40|$|Background: Due to {{considerable}} {{differences in}} pathogenicity, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. haemolyticus {{have to be}} reliably discriminated in routine diagnostics. Retrospective analyses suggest frequent <b>misidentifications</b> of commensal H. haemolyticus as H. influenzae. In a multi-center approach, we assessed the suitability of {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the identification of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. haemolyticus to species level. Methodology: A strain collection of 84 Haemophilus spp. comprising 50 H. influenzae, 25 H. parainfluenzae, 7 H. haemolyticus, and 2 H. parahaemolyticus including 77 clinical isolates was analyzed by FISH with newly designed DNA probes, and two different MALDI-TOF-MS systems (Bruker, Shimadzu) with and without prior formic acid extraction. Principal Findings: Among the 84 Haemophilus strains analyzed, FISH led to 71 correct results (85 %), 13 uninterpretable results (15 %), and no <b>misidentifications.</b> Shimadzu MALDI-TOF-MS resulted in 59 correct identifications (70 %), 19 uninterpretable results (23 %), and 6 <b>misidentifications</b> (7 %), using colony material applied directly. Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS with prior formic acid extraction led to 74 correct results (88 %), 4 uninterpretable results (5 %) and 6 <b>misidentifications</b> (7 %). The Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS <b>misidentifications</b> could be resolved by the addition of a suitable H. haemolyticus referenc...|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a <b>misidentification.</b>|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} <b>misidentification</b> by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} <b>misidentification</b> with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has {{vanished}} from {{much of its}} historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from <b>misidentification</b> of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is broadly but discontinuously {{distributed in the}} coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Georges Bank off New England southward to Florida, the Bahamas, and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico; there are also scattered reports from Venezuela to Argentina and on the Barrier reef in Belize. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. A single record from Quilon, India was likely a <b>misidentification.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like many boletes, Imperator torosus causes {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, diarrhoea {{and vomiting}} when eaten raw. These reactions can also happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse-like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, tingling in arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a <b>misidentification</b> of I.torosus with Suillellus luridus, though they could {{not rule out the}} latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for I.torosus.|$|E

5|$|Luminosity {{has been}} {{reported}} in the past and is probably due to <b>misidentification</b> of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.|$|E
5|$|One fighter {{regiment}} of the 1st Czechoslovak Composite Aviation Division {{was later}} {{equipped with the}} La-7 after participating in the Slovak National Uprising of August–October 1944 with La-5FN. A total of 56 aircraft were delivered and equipped the 1st and 2nd Fighter Regiments. The bulk of the aircraft, however, were delivered in 1945 and saw no combat during the war. It remained in service with the Czechoslovaks until 1950 and was designated postwar by them as the S-97. One of these aircraft survives in the Prague Aviation Museum, Kbely. Despite reports to the contrary, no La-7s were ever sold or transferred to the People's Republic of China or North Korea. Such reports arose from <b>misidentification</b> by Western pilots of the La-9s or La-11s that were given to those countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and <b>misidentification.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} Titania and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four spurious satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel's four satellites were spurious, probably arising from the <b>misidentification</b> of faint stars {{in the vicinity of}} Uranus as satellites, and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.|$|E
5|$|The bell frog's current {{distribution}} now ranges from Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria; populations mostly occur along the coast. In New South Wales, it has declined severely in range and abundance since the 1960s, although no similar declines {{have been reported}} in Victoria. In New South Wales, it has disappeared from highland areas above , except for a population in Captains Flat. A study of populations along coastal New South Wales indicated many populations were very small, usually of fewer than 20 adults. According to a 1996 study, six populations of more than 300 frogs are known: two in the Sydney metropolitan area, two in the Shoalhaven, and two in the New South Wales mid-north coast. There are now approximately only 40 sites in total where it is found, most of which are in the Sydney area. The green and golden bell frog has disappeared from an estimated 90% of its former range. Some specimens were apparently found in Armidale, {{but it turned out to}} be a <b>misidentification</b> of L. castanea. The declines in Victoria have been more modest and mostly in at inland areas where habitats have disappeared.|$|E
