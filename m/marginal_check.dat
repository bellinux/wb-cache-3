40|$|When {{inspection}} robot surmounts the obstacles, one arm is on {{the overhead}} ground wires (OGWs), the other arm is off OGWs. After surmounting the obstacles, the arm, which had been off, demands to be on OGWs again. Now {{the problem is that}} the pose of OGWs is unknown, and how to ensure the arm had been off comes back to OGWs again, and implements autonomous obstacles negotiating. Two laser sensors are adopted for <b>checking</b> two <b>marginal</b> points on OGWs, and the pose of OGWs is determined by the <b>checking</b> <b>marginal</b> points. According to the kinematics model of inspection robot, the rotary angles can be programmed by the algorithm proposed, and the arm can realizes autonomously to be on OGWs reliably. Finally, the simulation test shows that the algorithm presented is feasible.

40|$|Model {{selection}} for marginal regression analysis of longitudinal data is challeng-ing {{due to the}} presence of correlation and the difficulty of specifying the full like-lihood, particularly for correlated categorical data. This paper introduces a novel BIC-type model selection criterion based on the quadratic inference function (Qu, Lindsay and Li, 2000), which does not require the full likelihood or quasilikelihood. With probability approaching one, the criterion selects the most parsimonious cor-rect model. Although a working correlation matrix is assumed, {{there is no need to}} estimate the nuisance parameters in the working correlation matrix; moreover, the model selection procedure is robust against the misspecification of the working correlation matrix. The BIC-type criterion can also be used to construct a data-driven Neyman smooth test for checking the goodness-of-fit of a postulated model. This test is especially useful and often yields much higher power in situations where the classical directional test behaves poorly. The finite sample performance of the model selection and model checking procedures is demonstrated through Monte Carlo studies and analysis of a clinical trial data set.

40|$|SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging plays {{a central}} role in Remote Sensing due to, among other {{important}} features, its ability to provide high-resolution, day-and-night and almost weather-independent images. SAR images are affected from a granular contamination, speckle, that can be described by a multiplicative model. Many despeckling techniques have been proposed in the literature, as well as measures {{of the quality of the}} results they provide. Assuming the multiplicative model, the observed image Z is the product of two independent fields: the backscatter X and the speckle Y. The result of any speckle filter is X, an estimator of the backscatter X, based solely on the observed data Z. An ideal estimator would be the one for which the ratio of the observed image to the filtered one I=Z/ X is only speckle: a collection of independent identically distributed samples from Gamma variates. We, then, assess the quality of a filter by the closeness of I to the hypothesis that it is adherent to the statistical properties of pure speckle. We analyze filters through the ratio image they produce with regards to first- and second-order statistics: the former <b>check</b> <b>marginal</b> properties, while the latter verifies lack of structure. A new quantitative image-quality index is then defined, and applied to state-of-the-art despeckling filters. This new measure provides consistent results with commonly used quality measures (equivalent number of looks, PSNR, MSSIM, β edge correlation, and preservation of the mean), and ranks the filters results also in agreement with their visual analysis. We conclude our study showing that the proposed measure can be successfully used to optimize the (often many) parameters that define a speckle filter.

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} study (GWAS) is {{a popular}} strategy in studying complex diseases. GWAS genotypes 105 ∼ 106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from thousands of individuals. Compared to traditional “candidate gene” studies, in which {{a limited number of}} genetic variants are assayed, GWAS provides a much wider coverage across the human genome and enables us to identify more genetic variants associated with diseases. By October 2010, there are about 700 publications that have reported around 3000 SNPs associated with 150 diseases or complex traits. Despite of the success of GWAS, most of these findings only explain a small portion of genetic contributions to complex diseases. For example, all of 18 SNPs identified in type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) only account for about 6 % of the inherited risk. There is still a large portion of disease/trait heritability which remains unexplained. Recent GWAS publications name this unexplained heritability as missing heritability. Possible reasons for the missing heritability have been discussed recently, e. g., detecting gene-gene interactions and SNPs with relatively small effects is not fruitful. We address the issue of finding the missing heritability in the thesis as follows: First, we consider the issue of detecting gene-gene interactions which are believed as ubiquitous components of the biological pathways that underlie complex diseases. Gene-Gene interactions happen when their joint effects deviate from the simple summation of their individual effects. Before we investigate this topic, there is a stepwise way to detect gene-gene interactions based on SNP data, which is computationally feasible. It first analyzes one SNP at a time to evaluate the single SNP effect (i. e., the marginal effect of a single SNP) and then selects those SNPs with large <b>marginal</b> effects to <b>check</b> their interaction effects. Because a single SNP with weak effect on the disease risk may show a large joint effect with some other SNPs due to their interaction, this stepwise approach will miss a lot of genetic information. In order to guarantee that no strong interactions are missed, examination of all SNP pairs across the whole genome is needed, which would be computationally intensive. For example, we need to evaluate 1. 25 × 1011 SNP pairs for 500, 000 SNPs. We have developed a fast computational method named “BOolean Operation based Screening and Testing” (BOOST) to address this issue. BOOST can finish all tests within 60 hours on a single desktop. It is about 60 times faster than the state-of-art method PLINK. It has enabled us to efficiently identify the interaction patterns in GWAS. We have carried out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). The interaction patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, although both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. Second, we extend BOOST to detect “two-locus associations allowing for interactions” in GWAS. This type of associations involves SNPs which influence diseases via the combination of marginal effects and interaction effects. We also demonstrate the applicability of our method on nine real GWAS data sets, including the aged-related macular degeneration data set, the Parkinson’s disease data set, seven data sets from WTCCC. Our method has discovered some associations that were not identified before, which may contribute to finding the missing heritability. Third, we observe that some SNP pairs have significant associations, showing neither significant marginal effects nor interaction effects. The reason is that the marginal effects of correlated variables do not express their significant joint effects faithfully due to the correlation cancelation. This phenomenon is referred as “unfaithfulness”. We have developed a computational method to detect them. Our results show that the associations masked by unfaithfulness commonly exist in GWAS, but they are not identified by either marginal analysis or interaction analysis. Finally, we propose a method to detect disease-associated SNPs with small effects, which may be an important reason for the missing heritability. The chance is less than 8 % that a causal SNP will be directly genotyped. Due to the imperfect linkage disequilibrium, the observed effects of its neighboring SNPs decay largely such that the causal effect remains undiscovered. Even when a causal SNP has been directly genotyped, it is still challenging to detect the causal SNP with a small effect. Since the disease-associated SNPs account for {{only a small fraction of}} the entire SNP set, we formulate this problem as Contiguous Outlier DEtection (CODE). In our formulation, we cast the disease-associated SNPs as outliers and further impose a spatial continuity constraint for outlier detection. It turns out that our formulation can be exactly solved by graph cuts. We have shown that this method is more powerful than existing methods in detecting signals with small or moderate effective size by using two independent data sets of the Crohn’s disease...|$|R
