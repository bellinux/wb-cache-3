40|$|The {{key issue}} of {{continuous}} improvement (CI) {{seems to be}} the problem of combining extensive employee involvement with market orientation and continuation of CI. In this article we review some existing organisational designs for CI on these three essential characteristics of CI. As an alternative to the shortcomings of current organisational designs for CI we present the <b>mini-company</b> concept, related to the sociotechnical concept of the self-managing team. The <b>mini-company</b> concept incorporates the three key issues: it has a self-propelling capacity for CI, involving everyone on the shop floor. A constant and market-oriented source for improvement is found in the clients and suppliers of the <b>mini-company.</b> Results of an in-depth case-study are presented, showing some strong effects of the <b>mini-company</b> concept. ...|$|E
30|$|This study {{offers a}} {{longitudinal}} perspective on how learners {{who participated in}} <b>mini-companies</b> in Swiss higher secondary schools viewed the experience. Designed {{as a form of}} project-based learning in business education, <b>mini-companies</b> require real investments and active marketing on a small scale. During the school year 2012 / 13, students were questioned both in an early stage {{and at the end of}} the project on their business ideas, team cooperation, their views on entrepreneurship, learning motivation, and the development of skills and competencies. The paper analyzes their self-assessment regarding entrepreneurial skills and the impact of the project on personal development.|$|R
30|$|Evaluation {{studies on}} <b>mini-companies</b> confirm the {{importance}} of these skills, and indicate that these companies can contribute significantly to the clarification of career interests (Athayde & Hart, 2000; Hekman, 2007; Johansen, Schanke & Clausen, 2012). Participation in <b>mini-companies</b> does not, however, necessarily strengthen entrepreneurial intentions (Josten & van Elkan 2010), and can even result in disillusionment regarding prospective self-employment (Oosterbeek, van Praag & Ijsselstein, 2008). A comparison between non-participating youth and three cohorts from the Swedish Junior Achievement Company Program shows that participation increases the long-term probability of starting a firm, but concludes that participation has no effect on the survival of firms (Elert, Andersson & Wennberg, 2015).|$|R
30|$|Entrepreneurship {{education}} largely {{takes the}} normative approach that praises venturing {{as an act}} of self-actualization. Thus, <b>mini-companies</b> are promoted as opportunities for the development of competencies and skills that are considered important for success in the twenty-first century.|$|R
30|$|The {{confirmatory factor}} {{analysis}} and the structural equation modelling are based on two scales: agency and outcome. Regarding economic competencies, agency defines the self-perceived skill to present, argue and negotiate convincingly in a commercial context. The scale outcome includes items concerning {{the success of the}} <b>mini-company</b> in relation to the collaborative marketing of a product or service as well as the impact of participation in the <b>mini-company</b> on academic and work skills, employability and personality development. The model includes a distinction between high and low achievers using a variable that measures the selection of mini-companies for the national fair and thus for the final round of the national competition.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gain more {{in-depth}} knowledge into what Swedish upper secondary school students perceive they learn, and the factors that students perceive affect learning, when they start and run mini-companies within the Junior Achievement Company Program.   The data is comprised of interviews with eleven students each of whom ran a <b>mini-company</b> with other students. Situated learning theory, experiential learning theory and theoretical concepts on reflection in learning were used to analyze and further understand the data. The results reveal that the students talk about, and appear to convey, equal importance upon learning general skills as learning business skills when doing their mini-companies. Students describe using general skills they improved while running their mini-companies in other school activities and non-school activities leading to better performance in these activities. Doing business activities triggers learning and provides students with an opportunity to further develop, and learn multiple aspects, of skills. Students identify many factors, such as time, autonomy, assessment, and deadlines, which they associate with their mini-companies. On the whole, they say these factors have a positive effect on learning both business and general skills, however some factors can also inhibit learning. An analysis of all the factors students identified reveals that they originate, or are influenced by, multiple contexts such as school, the Swedish Junior Achievement organization, and the business environment. Together these factors can be said to create a special school community of practice for their <b>mini-company</b> project. Students point out significant differences between their <b>mini-company</b> project, and other school projects they have previously done, thus providing valuable insight into the importance of project design in relation to learning skills and possible pedagogical implications regarding learning general skills in other school projects. This thesis strives to gain further knowledge and understanding into what Swedish upper secondary students perceive they learn, and how they learn, when starting and running Junior Achievement mini-companies. The data is comprised of interviews with eleven students each of whom ran a <b>mini-company</b> with other students. Situated learning theory, experiential learning theory and theoretical concepts on reflection on learning were used to analyze and further understand the data. The results reveal that students talk about, and appear to convey, equal importance upon learning general and business skills. General skills students improved when doing mini-companies can benefit other school and non-school activities. Students perceive that learning is not only triggered by the business tasks they do, but is also influenced by a multitude of factors such as time, autonomy, assessment, and deadlines that affect what, and how they learn. Overall, students perceive factors that they associate with the <b>mini-company</b> project have a positive effect on learning skills, however some can also inhibit learning. Students point out many differences between the <b>mini-company</b> project and other school projects providing valuable insight into the importance of project design in relation to learning skills...|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} round, data were {{gathered}} between October and November 2012 with an online EvaSys 5.0 survey. At {{that point in}} time, the <b>mini-company</b> teams had defined their business ideas and were about to draft the business plan. In the second round, data were collected between April and May 2013. At {{this point in time}} it was clear which companies had been selected to participate in the national fair and the final competition.|$|E
30|$|The {{structural}} equation modelling {{shows that the}} constructs agency and outcome remain stable over time, which confirms hypotheses 1 and 2 and indicates that students’ competence-related expectations {{at the beginning of}} the projects are good predictors for their self-assessment at the final stage of the projects. On the one hand, students see the development of their <b>mini-companies</b> as a validation of potential business skills. On the other hand, the anticipated learning progress as related to future careers is confirmed in retrospect. This is in accordance with the expectancy-value theory of motivation (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000), which suggests that the expectation of success and the value that students place on a goal determine the project-related development of self-images. In the case of the <b>mini-companies,</b> students’ self-images are corroborated both on the level of skills and on the level of future perspectives, wherein higher expectations ex ante lead to a higher level of self-attributed success ex post.|$|R
30|$|The paper {{comprises}} six sections. The {{first section}} includes theoretical considerations and empirical insights regarding {{the concept of}} entrepreneurship. The second section lays out the concept of entrepreneurship education through <b>mini-companies,</b> while the third discusses existing findings on project-based learning and self-regulated learning. The fourth section presents the research design, while the fifth includes the findings. The results {{will be discussed in}} the sixth section, followed by a short conclusion.|$|R
30|$|The paper investigates how Swiss {{students}} on the higher secondary level evaluate their participation in <b>mini-companies.</b> Theoretically, the study draws {{on the concept of}} project-based learning (PBL). Data was collected in the first and the last stages of the projects and are analyzed by structural equation modelling (SEM). The analysis shows that the students display relatively stable attitudes regarding the development of specific business skills and regarding the impact of participation on the general development of competencies.|$|R
30|$|The {{expert report}} {{emphasizes}} {{that the success of}} mini-companies cannot only be deduced from the balance sheet, but must also be evaluated in light of the educational objectives. The importance of personal attributes like creativity, assertiveness, critical thinking or self-confidence is stressed with regard to the development of students’ business competencies. In this perspective, leadership and the taking of calculated risks are personal attributes, while basic economics and entrepreneurial thinking belong to the business skills required for the successful management of a <b>mini-company</b> (European Commission 2006, pp. 17 – 18).|$|E
40|$|Sociotechnical {{systems theory}} (STS) {{does not address}} in full the {{implications}} of the team-context relations, despite its open systems character. There is a need to open STS into a sociotechnical business systems (STBS) theory and practice. We observe three interrelated aspects that are important for STBS. First, the design of the production structure is a traditional STS aspect. Second, the design of the control structure on the team level needs an elaboration compared with STS. The third aspect is the social-dynamic alignment. We describe the <b>mini-company</b> concept and argue that this concept is a specification of STBS covering the three aspects. The case of the implementation of mini-companies in a Dutch manufacturing plant illustrates the strengths of the concept. ...|$|E
40|$|Both the European Community, {{its member}} {{countries}} and the United States have stimulated schools to implement entrepreneurship programs into schooling curricula on a large scale, {{based on the idea}} that entrepreneurial competencies and mindsets must be developed at school. The leading and acclaimed worldwide program is the Junior Achievement Student <b>Mini-Company</b> Program. Nevertheless, so far, its effects on students 9 ̆ 2 entrepreneurship competencies and attitudes have not been evaluated. This paper analyzes the impact of the program in a Dutch college using an instrumental variables approach in a difference-in-differences framework. The results show that the program does not have the intended effects: students 9 ̆ 2 self-assessed entrepreneurial skills remain unaffected and students 9 ̆ 2 intentions to become an entrepreneur even decrease significantly...|$|E
30|$|In similar vein, Junior Achievement Worldwide {{emphasizes}} that learning in <b>mini-companies</b> {{is marked by}} “a strong ‘hands on – learn by doing’ underpinning” (JA Worldwide, 2015 a, p. 6), which is not only beneficial for commercial activities, but also “helps to nurture the talent and energy of young people, building confidence, improving decision-making and fostering self-reliance” (JA Worldwide, 2015 b, p. 9). Entrepreneurial learning is considered a general asset, because the students “improve essential competencies such as creativity, initiative, tenacity, teamwork, understanding of risk {{and a sense of}} responsibility” (JA Europe, 2015, p. 6).|$|R
30|$|School {{projects}} can {{differ with}} regard to the significance of both service provision and competition. A strong emphasis on collaborative learning or helping efforts may lead to the misperception of school-related projects as essentially non-competitive. However, <b>mini-companies</b> in the context of YES combine collaboration amongst learners with competition for both market and academic success. Since entrepreneurship education requires solutions that are both practical and competitive, this study focuses on the relation between, on the one side, the perception of competence development and, on the other side, success on the level of trade fairs.|$|R
30|$|The {{study is}} based on two online {{questionnaires}} sent to all participating students {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the program. The first questionnaire focused on motivation, self-attributed economic competencies, expected learning outcomes, entrepreneurial intent, general views on the function of entrepreneurship in modern society, and expectations regarding the project. In the second wave, four scales from the first wave were repeated, namely questions concerning motivation, self-attributed competencies, entrepreneurial intent, and the function of entrepreneurship. These were supplemented by questions regarding the formation, development, and success of the <b>mini-companies,</b> and by questions concerning the project outcomes.|$|R
30|$|In {{considering}} the explanatory {{power of the}} results, different caveats {{must be taken into}} account. These caveats include the fact that the projects were limited to a period of one academic year and that the actual study from t 1 to t 2 was limited to 8  months, and the fact that student self-attributions cannot be related to career choices after graduation from senior high school. Accordingly, future research should consider students’ development after the end of their projects and analyze the choice of vocational fields and university subjects. Furthermore, the analysis should also take traits like self-efficacy and the general academic success of students into account. Lastly, in order {{to address the problem of}} self-selection bias, it is desirable to make comparisons with students who do not participate in such <b>mini-company</b> projects.|$|E
30|$|Within {{the scope}} of the YES program, {{students}} establish a <b>mini-company</b> to develop, implement and market either a product or a service. Mentored by teachers and supported by former participants as well as honorary business consultants, the teams organize themselves in order to realize their business ideas {{over the course of the}} school year. They write a business plan, raise funds, set up the business, and submit a financial account at the end of the cycle. During the project they participate in workshops and trade fairs organized by YES. While exhibiting their goods at trade fairs, they compete with other mini-companies, first on the regional level, and if successful, nationally. Comparing data of students elected for the national trade fair with data of students participating only on the regional level, the study investigates how the level of success influences the perception of entrepreneurial competence and personal development.|$|E
30|$|Project-based {{learning}} and entrepreneurship education chime well and {{can therefore be}} meaningfully combined. To begin with, since entrepreneurship is essentially project oriented, {{it makes sense that}} entrepreneurship education should be project-based too (Damon, Bronk & Porter, 2015; Geldhof et al., 2014). In addition, in both school-related projects and in “real life” market economy activities, opportunities have to be identified, evaluated and explored, and this despite the differences between the levels of risk-based decision-making in school projects compared to entrepreneurial projects in “real life”. Furthermore, even though learning outcomes cannot be equated with commercial profit, in both cases time, intelligence and other resources are invested under contingent conditions to achieve a goal. While there is an entrepreneurial trait in every school project, this is especially strong when this project is a <b>mini-company.</b> Because they mix learning outcomes and commercial profit, mini-companies therefore constitute a special case of school-related projects.|$|E
30|$|It must {{be taken}} into account though that {{measuring}} achievement by means of selection for the national fair is a considerable simplification. Student participation in <b>mini-companies</b> provides learning opportunities over almost a whole academic year, and there may be achievements that cannot be calculated on the level of collective effects. This includes the selection of project teams by a jury when considering the business plans, the balance sheets, as well as marketing activities on the internet and at regional fairs. Therefore, the insignificant effect that selection for the national fair has on the perceived validation of business skills implies that students’ self-image is partly independent of external feedback. In this sense, learning progress cannot be reduced to competitive success.|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of the moderator concerning the selection of <b>mini-companies</b> for the national fair supports this view. Specific anticipations concerning the growth of business skills focus on individual performance within the project team. The individual fulfillment of tasks within the team does not guarantee successful cooperation; thus, {{the focus on the}} self does not imply collective success. While the items of the scale “agency” talk about “me”, the perspective of the scale “outcome” is different: the items are formulated as universal statements concerning the entire group of students. Thus, the expectations are more team-related than the personal stance taken concerning the growth of business skills. Consequently, the expressed views on project outcomes have stronger implications regarding collective efforts and collective success.|$|R
30|$|While one {{strand of}} school-related {{projects}} focuses on self-directed research, a second strand focuses on community engagement and civic responsibility. Based {{on the principle}} that student activities should be linked to the common good, the latter approach combines learning goals with a range of community services (Youniss et al., 2002; Youniss, 2007). <b>Mini-companies,</b> in turn, represent a third strand of school-related projects. In this third strand, while inquiry does constitute an important component of student activities, it is subordinated to the commercial goals of the project: students have to engage in market research in order to define lucrative opportunities. Although the activities provide services, these services are not supposed to be altruistic. Rather, students have to pursue profitable services according to the liberal principle that prudent egoistic market behavior will promote public benefit.|$|R
30|$|The expert EU report {{argues that}} <b>mini-companies</b> {{should not be}} “directly focused on the {{creation}} of new businesses” (European Commission, 2006, p. 11). Rather, they should contribute to a new “entrepreneurial culture” and should diffuse the “entrepreneurial mindset” within the whole of society: “In fact, learning about entrepreneurship will include developing personal qualities such as creativity, taking initiative, responsibility, which will prove generally useful in life and in any working activity” (European Commission, 2013, p. 3). Proclaiming entrepreneurship as a “key competence for life”, an evaluation report of the European Commission stresses that citizens can take advantage of entrepreneurial thinking “in both their professional and private lives” (European Commission, 2015, p. 13). In a comparison of different strategies to develop such thinking, the evaluation concludes that entrepreneurship is “best taught through methods that include real-life conditions” (European Commission, 2015, p. 89).|$|R
