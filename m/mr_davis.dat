25|$|After {{the last}} Confederate cabinet meeting {{was held on}} April 26, 1865, at Charlotte, North Carolina, Jefferson Davis was {{captured}} at Irwinville, Georgia, and placed under arrest. He was briefly confined in an unheated, open casemate until the Union Surgeon John J. Craven recommended more humane care for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis.</b> General Nelson A. Miles approved changes and even moved <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis</b> to more hospitable quarters. He was held at Fort Monroe for two years. Some historians have speculated that his treatment in captivity {{was intended to be}} lethal. In poor health, Davis was released in May, 1867, on bail, which was posted by prominent citizens of both Northern and Southern states, including Horace Greeley and Cornelius Vanderbilt, who had become convinced he was being treated unfairly. The federal government proceeded no further in its prosecution due to the constitutional concerns of U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase.|$|E

500|$|The school {{underwent}} major {{demographic changes}} following the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in the May 1954 decision [...] "Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas" [...] case {{that called for}} an end to racial segregation. African Americans joined City College for the first time at the end of that summer, in September 1954 and became a significant proportion of the student population by the 1960s, with over half black by 1966, reflecting similar trends in the city itself. Mr. Pierre H. Davis, also later became the first [...] "Negro"/"Colored" [...] teacher to join the B.C.C. faculty the following year of 1955 for only one year in the Business Education Department, along with Eugene Parker in the Physical Education Department, who went on becoming head basketball coach for three decades. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis,</b> coincidentally returned 15 years later to become the first Afro-American principal of the City College in September 1970. The school saw further changes in the student population with the admission of women in 1978.|$|E

500|$|The flow of {{travelers}} and settlers intensified {{with the end}} of the Black Hawk War in 1832. In 1833 the hotel housed election of the first town trustees of the newly formed Town of Chicago. Beaubien kept the Hotel until 1834 and during his ownership he regularly entertained guests with his violin. On August 18, 1835, two years after the Potawatomi natives signed the treaty agreeing to be moved to a reservation beyond the Mississippi River in northwestern Missouri, they selected 800 braves to perform their last war dance parade on a path that passed in front of the hotel. In 1835, a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis</b> assumed control of the hotel, which subsequently had a series of proprietors. [...] The building briefly served as Chicago's first theater, and hosted the first Chicago Theatre company in November 1837 in an abandoned dining room. By 1839, it returned to service as a hotel, but was destroyed by fire in 1851, and subsequently torn down. The Wigwam was built in its place nine years later.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Longstreet and {{his family}} settled in New Orleans, a {{location}} popular {{with a number of}} former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created and prominent insurance company. He actively sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans around the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico south across the Rio Grande river and American-Mexican border to Monterrey, Mexico, (In 1870, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad). He applied for a pardon from 17th President Andrew Johnson, endorsed by his old friend and Union Army General-in-Chief, [...] Ulysses S. Grant. Johnson refused, however, telling Longstreet in a meeting: [...] "There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis,</b> General Lee, and yourself. You have given the Union cause too much trouble." [...] Regardless of such opposition the Radical Republican controlled United States Congress restored his rights of American citizenship in June 1868.|$|E

2500|$|The Powers that Be at KFJC {{were given}} a rather rude wake up call in early 1985. The station was granted host status for the 1985 Convention, yet it's legendary Music Director had {{vanished}} from the scene. [...] For what ever the reason, Mr. Stapelton, for months, had simply {{failed to show up}} for work. [...] He had left a big hole in the operations of not only a major college radio station, but The College Radio Station that was the Host of the 1985 I.B.S. Convention. [...] Meetings were hastily called to order.

2500|$|Lincoln and Stephens {{had been}} {{political}} allies {{before the war}} and the meeting began on friendly terms. Stephens discussed the topic of a military alliance against France in Mexico, but Lincoln cut him off and asked directly about the question of sovereignty.

Campbell wrote: [...] "We learned in five minutes that the assurances to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis</b> were a delusion, and that union was the condition of peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|He duped <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis</b> {{with the}} belief that President Lincoln {{regarded}} the condition of Mexico with more concern than the war; that {{he would be willing to}} make a suspension of hostilities under some sort of collusive contract, and to unite Southern and Northern troops on the Rio Grande for the invasion of Mexico, and that after matters were assured in Mexico affairs might be adjusted here. This was the business at Hampton Roads. I was incredulous, Mr. Hunter did not have faith. Mr. Stephens supposed Blair to be [...] "the mentor of the Administration and Republican party." ...|$|E

Following a series of acts deemed prejudicial to the defense, Workman's attorneys asked Judge Colton to remove himself from the case, but this was denied and the hearing proceeded with Judge Colton presiding. [...] Observers contend that the subsequent trial was conducted in a manner biased against Workman, citing in particular the failure of Judge Colton to protect <b>Mr.</b> <b>Davis</b> and Dr. Wecht from abusive questioning by the District Attorney. Judge Colton also disallowed Wardie Parks, a member of the 1982 jury who has since renounced his verdict, to speak as a witness of new evidence.|$|E

A year later, Beecham invited him to collaborate with him in preparing The Magic Flute at Glyndebourne. Beecham was taken ill, and Davis conducted the opera. After the Don Giovanni, The Times wrote, [...] "A superb conductor of Mozart declared himself {{last night at the}} Festival Hallâ¦. <b>Mr</b> <b>Davis</b> emerged as a conductor ripe for greatness." [...] Neville Cardus in The Guardian was less enthusiastic but nevertheless considered that he [...] "had his triumphs" [...] in the performance. After The Magic Flute, The Times called Davis [...] "master of Mozart's idiom, style and significance", although Heyworth in The Observer was disappointed by his tempi, judging them to be too slow.|$|E

When they heard nothing about an explosion during the next few days, they assumed that their bomb had failed to explode. But they had mistakenly set the bomb on an inactive level, and it did not go off until some time later, when the superintendent and the shift boss got off to inspect the 600-foot level, and set off the dynamite.|$|E

[...] Of the seven papers described as recantations by the defense, Moore found that only one was wholly credible and two were partly credible. He did not consider Coles' alleged confessions because {{of the failure of}} Davis's lawyers to subpoena Coles, and suggested that Davis should appeal directly to the Supreme Court. In November 2010, the federal appeals panel dismissed an appeal on the case, without ruling on its merits. They stated that Davis should appeal the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court [...] "because he had exhausted his other avenues of relief."
