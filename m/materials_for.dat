5|$|As cubic {{boron nitride}} {{consists}} of light atoms {{and is very}} robust chemically and mechanically, {{it is one of}} the popular <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de Secours (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> at least 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) {{served as a}} channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture.

Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant <b>materials.</b> <b>For</b> example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
