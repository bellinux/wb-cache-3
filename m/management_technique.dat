5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. They maintained cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land <b>management</b> <b>technique</b> enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how the forests rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, {{at least as far}} as Mole Creek, and lived in villages of bark huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|E

40|$|According to NPM, more {{effective}} and efficient public services can be delivered if public sector organizations are granted more managerial autonomy and if they use various (private sector) <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> To date, only very limited {{attention has been paid}} to the link between managerial autonomy and the use of <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> With this study, we seek to fill this gap in the extensive NPM literature by examining the extent to which managerial autonomy has an effect on the use of <b>management</b> <b>techniques,</b> thereby focusing on quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> In general, we try to shed light on the determinants of the use of quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> Therefore, besides managerial autonomy we also look at other factors that might affect the use of quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> e. g. result control, legal statute, organizational size, organizational culture. 	The results of two surveys – being conducted in 124 Flemish public sector organizations – indicated that managerial autonomy is positively related to the use of quality management techniques: the higher the level of managerial autonomy, the larger the extent to which quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> are used. Also result control is positively associated with the use of quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> No significant differences were found in the extent to which quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> were used among small and large organizations. The relationship between managerial autonomy, result control and the use of quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> was not as clear-cut as expected: the organization’s legal statute and some organizational cultural aspects (emphasis on innovation, valuing customers) act as mediators in this relationship. Overall, the results of this study imply that one should be careful in stating that managerial autonomy, result control directly lead to a better service delivery (by e. g. using quality <b>management</b> <b>techniques)</b> as other factors seem to intervene in the autonomy – performance link. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area were the Pallittorre Clan of the Northern Nation of Aboriginal Tasmanians. The North Midlands Nation name for Quamby Bluff was lartitickitheker (lar.tit.ick.it.he.ker).There are caves south of Meander, in the Great Western Tiers, with deposits showing aboriginal habitation, though these have not been dated. The deposits were either left by the Pallittorre, or their neighbours the Luggermairrernerpairre {{who were part of}} the neighbouring Big River tribe. The Pallittorre probably inhabited the area for thousands of years; aborigines are believed to have lived in Tasmania for more than 30,000 years. They maintained cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land <b>management</b> <b>technique</b> enabled easier hunting and food gathering.|$|E
25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective <b>management</b> <b>technique.</b> Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{perceptions}} of elementary school teachers in public schools in Southern California regarding their use of classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques,</b> specifically examining physical and psychological practices to maintain classroom discipline. The research design involved a survey that was used to collect data on teacher perceptions, use, and observed use of specific classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> by other teachers.; Four research questions were developed to guide the study: (1) Which classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> are teachers self-reporting to engage in most frequently? (2) Which positive and negative classroom management practices are prevalent in K- 8 classrooms today? (3) Which classroom management practices do elementary school teachers regard as effective in changing student behavior? (4) What is the relationship between what classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> that teachers say are the most effective and what they self-report they engage in?; This study surveyed 285 teachers in various Title 1 elementary schools servicing Kindergarten through Grade 8 students in Southern California. Descriptive statistics were calculated to examine the prevalence of positive and negative classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques,</b> teachers' perceptions of their effectiveness, and the relationship between teachers' perceptions and actual practice in K- 8 classrooms today.; Due to the design of this study, causation could not be determined. This study found that teachers reported to engage in positive classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> more often than negative classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques.</b> Although positive technique use was reported to be more prevalent, proportion of teachers using negative techniques was evident. Further, data suggested that various variables, such as gender, grade level taught, years of teaching experience, and level of education, may have influenced teacher perception and use of positive and negative classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> as effective. Conversely, they perceivednegative classroom <b>management</b> <b>techniques</b> as ineffective. The examination of the relationship between teacher perception and practice yielded correlations that demonstrated statistical significance between perceived level of effectiveness and practice...|$|R

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{argument is}} that the way to [...] "save the environment" [...] and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the Push–pull agricultural pest <b>management</b> <b>technique</b> which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. [...] "The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{management}} {{of a cultural}} heritage object serves to identify the staff members responsible for care and maintenance of the collection, and establish proper <b>management</b> <b>technique</b> guidelines. Records management should take place when an object enters a collection, when it is moved or shipped, during regular collection inventories, and throughout any conservation treatment as per established collection management policy standards. Records {{management of}} a cultural heritage object often {{takes place in the}} form of photographic documentation combined with written reports designed to provide a visual reference for future professionals, revealing the original condition and any successive states of the condition. [...] These records are sometimes digitized and stored in computer databases using collection cataloging software. One aspect of records management designed specifically for sustaining these digitized records and documenting digital collection materials is known as digital preservation. This technique is used to reformat or duplicate an original object so as to preserve a piece of digital material for as long as possible. Combining strategic planning with conservation actions, digital preservation aims to maintain continued access to digital objects that would otherwise become obsolete.|$|E
