50|$|Easy Cheese is an oil-in-water emulsion. Oil {{droplets}} {{typically have}} {{a diameter of}} no more than one micrometer. Emulsions with large droplets like this tend to have a low-medium viscosity in comparison to smaller droplets whose emulsions have a higher viscosity. Heating the cheese mixture causes separation of the fats and protein of the cheese emulsion from destabilization. Emulsifying agents are made up of amphiphilic molecules that act as an interface to reduce the surface tension between hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules of the product to result in a uniform cheese spread that does not separate during storage. Cheese proteins that have denatured during processing are reestablished using <b>melting</b> <b>salts.</b> Sodium citrate and sodium phosphate are the main emulsifiers used in Easy Cheese to sequester calcium in cheddar cheese. This occurrence hydrates and solubilizes the casein, causing it to swell with water. The addition of these salts contributes to the uniformly creamy consistency of Easy Cheese.|$|E

In this way, anion hydrophobicity parameters are derived, as well as an equation to estimate water solubilities for cation-anion combinations for which the water solubility has not been measured.

40|$|The cycle {{performance}} of refrigeration cycles depends {{not only on}} their configuration, but also on thermodynamic properties of working pairs regularly composed of refrigerant and absorbent. The commonly used working pairs in absorption cycles are aqueous solutions of either lithium bromide water or ammonia water. However, corrosion, crystallization, high working pressure, and toxicity are their major disadvantages in industrial applications. Therefore, seeking more advantageous working pairs with good thermal stability, with minimum corrosion, and without crystallization has become the research focus {{in the past two}} decades. Ionic liquids (ILs) are room-temperature <b>melting</b> <b>salts</b> that can remain in the liquid state at near or below room temperature. ILs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, nonflammability, thermal stability, good solubility, low melting points, and staying in the liquid state over a wide temperature range from room temperature to about 300 °C.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{ability of}} cholinium-([Ch](+)) -based salts, including ionic liquids (ILs), to form biocompatible aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) with polyethylene glycols (PEGs) was deeply scrutinized in this work. Aqueous solutions of {{low molecular weight}} PEG polymers (400, 600, and 1000 g mol(- 1)) and [Ch](+) salts of chloride, acetate, bicarbonate, glycolate, lactate, dihydrogenphosphate, dihydrogencitrate, and bitartrate can undergo liquid-liquid demixing at certain concentrations of the phase-forming components and at several temperatures. Cholinium butanoate and propanoate were also studied; however, these long alkyl side chain ILs {{are not able to}} promote an immiscibility region with PEG aqueous solutions. The ternary liquid-liquid phase diagrams, binary water activities, PEG-salt and salt-H 2 O solubility data, and binary and ternary excess enthalpies estimated by COSMO-RS (COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Realistic Solvation) were used to obtain new insights into the molecular-level mechanisms responsible for phase separation. Instead of the expected and commonly reported salting-out phenomenon induced by the [Ch](+) salts over the polymer, the formation of PEG-[Ch](+) salt ABS was revealed to be an end result of a more intricate molecular scenario. The multifaceted approach employed here reveals that the ability to promote an ABS is quite different for the higher <b>melting</b> <b>salts</b> vs. the lower melting or liquid ILs. In the latter systems, the ABS formation seems to be controlled by the interplay of the relative strengths of the ion-ion, ion-water, ion-PEG, and water-PEG interactions, with a significant contribution from specific hydrogen-bonding between the IL anion and the PEG hydroxyl groups...|$|E

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to examine the changes in the secondary structure of BSA on varying concentration of a particular ionic liquid from 0 M to 1. 0 M. It is observed that on increasing the concentrations of particular ionic liquid, structured regions are transformed to unstructured regions and thereby, assisting protein unfolding. Similarly, a gradual disruption of the native structure of BSA is observed with increase in the alkyl chain length of ionic liquids...|$|E

Continual hourly monitoring of the raw sewage, between June 1992 and May 1993. yielded average monthly fluoride concentrations between 0. 072 mg/L and 1. 984 mg/L, with an annual mean of 0. 45 mg/L. Daily variations and frequency distributions showed a wider range of fluoride levels, with the maximum values possibly reaching as high as 4 -fold the mean and well over 2 orders of magnitude higher than the minimum values. This suggests that significant massive point discharges occur in the sewer network. Daily monitoring of the precipitation showed that the mean fluoride concentration in liquid precipitation generally fluctuates between 0. 030 mg/L and 0. 741 mg/L, whereas the average fluoride specific mass in dry precipitation ranges between 0. 096 kg/km$ sp 2 $ and 2. 775 kg/km$ sp 2 $.

Mass balance analyses have shown that the mass of fluoride resulting from infiltration and non-fluoridated waters, as well as that due to the domestic habits of the population constitute, among the identified sources, the major input of fluoride mass into the wastewater.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce our fossil based energy {{consumption}} there is an urge for new energy storage and conversion devices such as lithium batteries and fuel cells for more efficient energy use. The heart of these devices is an ion conducting electrolyte which needs to provide high performance at low cost. This thesis focuses on new electrolyte materials; the first part concerns lithium salts with prospects to increase the performance and safety of lithium batteries, {{and the second part}} deals with protic ionic liquids (pILs), a new electrolyte material for low temperature fuel cells. By combining high accuracy quantum mechanical calculations with vibrational spectroscopy, an increased understanding of the properties of these new materials was obtained. This knowledge is important in the development of improved materials. Two promising types of binary lithium salts were investigated; lithium salts incorporating one (azole type) and two (orthoborate type) ring structures with pending electron drawing groups for charge delocalisation. The calculated lithium binding energies of both these types of salts are 10 - 15 % lower than for the lithium salt used in batteries today. From the calculated and characterised salt structures new improved salts have been proposed for synthesis at collaborating laboratories, completing our feedback cycle.

This research examined the solubility and secondary structure of the hydrophobic corn protein zein in seven ionic liquids and three conventional solvents as a function of temperature and solvent properties. Zein’s solubility in the solvents was measured gravimetrically from 30 to 60 degrees Celsius. Solubility was then related to solvent properties to gain an understanding of what solvent properties are important, and how to design an ionic liquid to dissolve zein. It was found that a good solvent for zein has a small molecular volume, a low polarity, and is a weak hydrogen bond acceptor. 	Infrared spectroscopy with curve fitting was used to examine the secondary structure of zein as a function of both solvent and temperature from 25 to 95 degrees Celsius. It was found that most of the ionic liquids change zein’s secondary structure, but those secondary structure changes were not affected by temperature. Aprotic ionic liquids increase the amount of β-turn secondary structure through non-polar interactions between the mixed aromatic-alkyl imidazolium cations and the non-polar portions of the zein. Strong hydrogen bond accepting molecules were found to increase the amount of β-turn secondary structure. 	It is hypothesized from this research that suitable solvents for zein will have a small molar volume, low polarity, and be poor hydrogen bond acceptors.

40|$|Scientists have a {{key role}} to play in the {{development}} of a more sustainable society. Ionic liquids, low <b>melting</b> <b>salts,</b> are an unusual class of compounds which offer a large potential for technological advancements in many sectors. Examples are found in energy storage, biopolymer valorization and product separations. Ionic liquids are excellent solvents for cellulose and have been known to catalyze a whole range of reactions. Therefore, the focus in this work is on the physicochemical and catalytic effect of ionic liquids on different polymers. In the first part, thedehydrochlorination of chlorinated polymers such as poly(vinyl chloride) is explored. The end-of-life treatment of PVC is complicated by its large chlorine content. Different phosphonium ionic liquids dissolve PVC and catalyze the dehydrochlorination reaction, the removal of HCl from the polymer chain. Dissolution facilitates the reaction due to the better contact between the polymer and the catalyst. Ionic liquids containing anions with a high hydrogen-bond basicity are the best catalysts for the reaction. In tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, [P 4444][Cl], this results in a dehydrochlorination degree of 98  %. Stabilized PVC is dehydrochlorinated more slowely, but still a high conversion of over 96  % is reached. Chemical recycling of dehydrochlorinated polymers can be achieved via reverse acyclic diene metathesis, allowing the design of a process with a high carbon efficiency, producing valuable chemicals fromwaste. In the second part, the remarkable interaction between cellulose and ionic liquids is studied. Cellulose is known to dissolve in a range of ionic liquids. Dissolution occurs through breaking of the extensive hydrogen bond network, generating less crystalline cellulose. Reduction in crystallinity is an essential step in cellulose valorization. Regeneration of dissolved cellulose however requires the addition of an anti-solvent, such as water, which afterwards has to be removed from the ionic liquid. As this removal is very energy-intensive, an alternative treatment is proposed in this work: cellulose amorphization can also be achieved via soaking in ionic liquid/water mixtures. The optimal water concentration in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate, [EMIM][CH 3 COO], is 20 wt %. At this concentration the reduction in crystallinity is maximized and the loss of cellulose due to dissolution is minimized. Furthermore, the addition of water to the ionic liquid significantly decreases the viscosity of the mixture. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used as a structure-sensitive technique to monitor the changes in crystallinity in situ, confirming the results of thebatch experiments. Soaking of cellulose in ionic liquid/water mixtures provides a single step method to obtain less crystalline cellulose, available for further enzymatic or chemical processing. In the last part,the dissolution and valorization of lignin, one of the three major biomass constituents, is studied. The different ether and C-C linkages between the aromatic building blocks of this polymer complicate the design ofdepolymerization methods. Dissolution is a first step in the valorization of lignin. Ionic liquids are prime candidates for lignin dissolution. Their low volatility and flammability allow the design of safer and cleaner chemical processes. In this work, we explored lignin dissolution innon-imidazolium ionic liquids, which are more stable in harsher reaction conditions. N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide, [BMPyr][N(CN) 2], combines a high lignin dissolution capacity and a low viscosity with a very low cellulose dissolution capacity, allowing separation of the biomass fractions prior to lignin valorization. Valorization of lignincan be achieved via mild oxidative and acidic depolymerization. Bismuth-promoted platinum on acidic carbon was tested as a catalyst system on different lignin model compounds. The selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols allows the acidic cleavage of the typical β-O-aryl etherbond in lignin. During this process, phenol groups are retained, allowing the production of functionalized aromatics from lignin. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquid forming {{compounds}} often display {{low melting}} points (a lack of crystallisation {{at ambient temperature}} and pressure) due to decreased lattice energies in the crystalline state. The degree of anion-cation contact {{with respect to the}} type, strength and number of interactions is a major factor determining the lattice energies, melting point and general behaviour of ionic liquid forming salts. Intermolecular interactions between the anion and cation and the conformational states of each component of the salt are of interest since distinctive properties ascribed to ionic liquids are determined to a significant extent by these interactions. The direct insight into the spatial relationship between cation and anion provided by the analysis of crystal structures provides a basis from which features of the ionic liquid can be generally understood, since the short range order and interactions of related, non-crystalline compounds may be {{similar to those of the}} crystalline form. However, it is difficult to predict whether a particular ionic pair will produce a liquid at room temperature, due to numerous possible combinations of cations and anions and the subtleties of their interactions. Crystal engineering is the ability to assemble molecular or ionic components into the desired crystalline architecture by engineering a target network of supramolecular interactions known as synthons. In this investigation the problem of ionic liquid design is addressed using the concepts of crystal engineering in an inverse sense, the so-called anti crystal-engineering approach. A topical area in which the anti crystal-engineering concept may be of some value is that of Ionic Liquid Phases of Pharmaceutically Active Ions (Active Ionic Liquids). Thus, by using the knowledge gained of the intermolecular interactions, packing and ionic conformation which occur within ‘traditional’ ionic liquids, combined with the knowledge of which functional group combinations yield supramolecular synthons resulting in crystalline subjects, and the subsequent prevention thereof (anti crystal-engineering), appropriate ions shall be selected which may result in ionic liquid formation. The intermolecular interactions of a series of: • crystallised bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide (NTf 2) and bis(methanesulfonyl) amide (NMes 2) ionic liquids, • low melting N-alkyl- 2 -methyl- 3 -benzylimidazolium iodide salts with a range of alkyl chain lengths, from n= 1 to 6 and including both n-butyl and s-butyl chains, • 1 -methyl- 1 -propylpyrrolidinium chloride and, • a number of low <b>melting</b> <b>salts</b> containing trihalide and monohalide ions, in combination with typical IL organic cations namely, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium, 1 -ethyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium and 1 -propyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium, were qualitatively investigated and/or compared using a combination of crystallographic, Hirshfeld surface and thermal analysis techniques. The NMes 2 salts are known to exhibit higher glass transitions and higher viscosities than those of the NTf 2 salts. The origins of these differences were analysed in terms of the importance of factors such as the C-H•••O hydrogen bond, fluorination, presence of an aromatic moiety and length of alkyl chain, using the Hirshfeld surfaces and their associated fingerprint plots. Additionally, the existence of C-F•••π and C-H•••π interactions were elucidated and the significance of anion-anion interactions was recognised. Thermal analysis of the N-alkyl- 2 -methyl- 3 -benzylimidazolium iodide salts revealed that the methyl- and (s-) butyl substituted salts have a significantly higher melting point than the rest of the series. Analysis of these crystal structures allowed examination of the influence of the substitutions on the different cation-anion and cation-cation interactions and thus the physical properties of the salts. Thermal analysis of the monohalide and trihalide salts revealed that the tribromide salts are lower melting than their monohalide analogues. Analysis of these crystal structures revealed the influence of the anions and the crystal packing on the physical properties of the salts. A series of crystalline and liquid salts were prepared from cations and anions drawn from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) materials. The solid-state structures of the crystalline salts were used as a basis for the anti-crystal engineering approach in the preparation of several “Active Ionic Liquids” (AILs). However, a side product also resulted during the synthetic route namely, methyl 9 H-xanthene- 9 -carboxylate, a side product resulting from the API, propantheline.

The resulting copper or silver d eposits, made at high current densities, have a smooth appearance, did n ot show cracks and were free from entrapped organic compounds. Lower cur rent densities result in nodular deposits. The use of thiourea or 1 H-ben zotriazole as additive resulted in smooth morphologies at 1 A dm&# 8722; 2. It is believed that excellent mass transport in this system is due to the high metal concentration and to the favorable electrostatic interact ions between the cationic electroactive species and the cathode. This ma kes the use of liquid metal salts with electrochemically active cationic complexes interesting for electrochemical applications where mass trans port is important. The fact that comparable results are obtained for two metals, indicates that the complexes with a metal center, surrounded by acetonitrile, lead to ionic liquids {{that can be used for}} high current d ensity electroplating. A second interesting property of liquid metal sal ts is that high overpotentials can be applied during electrodeposition. This leads to a small critical size for nucleation, which is advantageou s during the plating of copper on barrier materials such as tantalum. By using [Cu(MeCN) 2][Tf 2 N] as medium for copper electrodeposition on a tantalum substrate, a nucleation density of 8 e 14 m&# 8722; 2 is reached. The resulting deposits contain very few pinholes and have thicknesses o f 19 nm. Electrochemical vacuum deposition is a technique which exploits the low vapor pressure of ionic liquids. In contrast with aqueous solutions or o rganic solvents, ionic liquids can be placed in a high vacuum environmen t, without noticeable loss of ionic liquid, to strongly decrease the amo unt of oxygen gas and water. Possible applications are the deposition of copper on tantalum, but results indicate that even at the low pressure of a high vacuum environment, the oxidation of tantalum cannot be avoide d. A finite element model of the electrodeposition of aluminium from chloro aluminate ionic liquids was made to study the influence of the rate cons tants kb and kf on the electrodeposition rate of aluminium. These rate c onstants determine the equilibrium between Al 2 Cl 7 &# 8722;, AlCl 4 &# 8722;, and Cl&# 8722;. It was found that thermodynamics and kinetics change in o pposite directions for variations in kb or kf and these opposing effects lead to a minimum in the calculated current density as a function of kb. A comparison of the calculated data and the experimental limiting curr ent densities indicates that the value of kb lies between 1 e&# 8722; 7. 5 a nd 1 e&# 8722; 6. 7 m 3 mol&# 8722; 1 s&# 8722; 1. Electrochemical oscillations are a phenomenon in which a constant applie d potential leads to an oscillating current or that a constant applied c urrent gives rise to an oscillating potential. A former type of electroc hemical oscillator was found in a mixture of monovalent with divalent co pper ions in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride. The oscillator is an N-NDR-type because the low frequency-end of the impedance spectrum has n egative real impedances and the steep decrease in current in the potenti al-current curve. The presence of chloride is also a necessary, yet not a sufficient condition for the occurrence of current oscillations and th e imidazolium cation also plays a role in the reactions leading to the o scillatory behavior. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquids (IL) {{represent}} fascinating {{new class}} of solvents with unusual physical and chemical properties; low <b>melting</b> <b>salts</b> (up to 1000 C). The main driving force for {{research in this area}} is the need to find replacement for environmentally damaging solvents {{in a wide range of}} chemical processes. To date, most chemical reactions have been carried out in molecular solvents. For the past twenty years, most of our understanding of our chemistry has been based upon the behavior of molecules in the solution phase in molecular solvents. Recently a {{new class of}} solvents has emerged called as Ionic liquids. An ionic liquid is an organic salt in which the ions are poorly coordinated, which results in these solvents being liquid below 100 °C, or even at room temperature (room temperature ionic liquids, RTIL's). At least one ion has a delocalized charge and one component is organic, which prevents the formation of a stable crystal lattice. Ionic liquids are composed entirely of ions. For example, molten sodium chloride is an ionic liquid; in contrast, a solution of sodium chloride in water (a molecular solvent) is an ionic solution. The term “ionic liquids” has replaced the older phrase “molten salts” (or “melts”), which suggests that they are high-temperature, corrosive, viscous media (like molten minerals). The reality is that ionic liquids can be liquid at temperatures as low as – 96 °C. Furthermore, room-temperature ionic liquids are frequently colourless, fluid, and easy to handle. In the patent and academic literature, the term “ionic liquids” now refers to liquids composed entirely of ions that are fluid around or below 100 °C 1. Properties, such as melting point, viscosity, and solubility of starting materials and other solvents, are determined by the substituents on the organic component and by the counter ion. Many ionic liquids have even been developed for specific synthetic problems. For this reason, ionic liquids have been termed "designer solvents”. This means that their properties can be adjusted to suit the requirements of a particular process. Properties such as melting point, viscosity, density, and hydrophobicity can be varied by simple changes to the structure of the ions. For example, the melting points of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborates and hexafluorophosphates are a function of the length of the 1 -alkyl group, and form liquid crystalline phases for alkyl chain lengths over 12 carbon atoms. Another important property that changes with structure is the miscibility of water in these ionic liquids. For example, 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate salts are miscible with water at 25 °C where the alkyl chain length is less than 6, but at or above 6 carbon atoms, they form a separate phase when mixed with water. This behaviour can be of substantial benefit when carrying out solvent extractions or product separations, as the relative solubility’s of the ionic and extraction phase can be adjusted to make the separation as easy as possible. In addition, ionic liquids have practically no vapour pressure which facilitates product separation by distillation. There are also indications that switching from a normal organic solvent to an ionic liquid can lead to novel and unusual chemical reactivity. This opens up a wide field for future investigations into this new class of solvents in catalytic applications. Research into ionic liquids is booming. The first industrial process involving ionic liquids was announced in March 2003, and the potential of ionic liquids for new chemical technologies is beginning to be recognized. One of the primary driving forces behind research into ionic liquids is the perceived benefit of substituting traditional industrial solvents, most of which are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with non-volatile ionic liquids. Replacement of conventional solvents by ionic liquids would prevent the emission of VOCs, a major source of environmental pollution. Ionic liquids are not intrinsically “green”—some are extremely toxic—but they can be designed to be environmentally benign, with large potential benefits for sustainable chemistry. There are four principal strategies to avoid using conventional organic solvents: No solvent (heterogeneous catalysis), water, supercritical fluids, and ionic liquids. The solventless option is the best established, and is central to the petrochemical industry, the least polluting chemical sector. The use of water can also be advantageous, but many organic compounds are difficult to dissolve in water, and disposing of contaminated aqueous streams is expensive 2. Supercritical fluids, which have both gas- and liquid-like properties, are highly versatile solvents for chemical synthesis. This technology was recently commercialized by Thomas Swan & Co., Ltd., in a chemical plant designed for multipurpose synthesis. Together with ionic liquids, these alternative solvent strategies (sometimes referred to as alternative reaction media or green solvents) provide a range of options to industrialists looking to minimize the environmental impact of their chemical processes. What are the advantages of using a room-temperature ionic liquid in an industrially relevant catalytic process? As noted above, ionic liquids have no detectable vapour pressure, and therefore contribute no VOCs to the atmosphere. But this is not the only reason for using ionic liquids. Another is that at least a million binary ionic liquids, and 1018 ternary ionic liquids, are potentially possible 3. (For comparison, about 600 molecular solvents are in use today.) The next decade should see ionic liquids being used in many applications where conventional organic solvents are used today. Furthermore, ionic liquids will enable new applications that are not possible with conventional solvents. In the future, solvents will be designed to control chemistry, rather than the chemistry being dictated by the more limited range of molecular solvents currently used 4. As discussed above, Ionic liquids are salts consisting of cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, quarternary ammonium and quarternaryphosphonium, and anions such as halogen, triflate, trifluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate, which exists in the liquid state at relatively low temperatures. Their characteristic features include almost no vapour pressure, non-inflammability, non-combustibility, high thermal stability, relatively low viscosity, wide temperature ranges for being liquids and ionic liquid conductivity...|$|E
40|$|This review {{presents}} the latest results of studies directed at photocatalyst coatings of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) prepared by mechanical coating technique (MCT) and its application. Compared with traditional coating techniques, MCT is a simple, low cost and useful coating formation process, which is proposed and developed based on mechanical frictional wear and impacts between substrate materials and metal powder {{particles in the}} bowl of planetary ball mill. The formation process of the metal coatings in MCT includes four stages: The nucleation by adhesion, the formation and coalescence of discrete islands, formation and thickening of continuous coatings, exfoliation of continuous coatings. Further, two-step MCT was developed based on the MCT concept for preparing composite coatings on alumina (Al 2 O 3) balls. This review also discusses the influence on the fabrication of photocatalyst coatings after MCT and improvement of its photocatalytic activity: oxidation conditions, coating materials, <b>melt</b> <b>salt</b> treatment. In this review, the oxidation conditions had been studied on the oxidation temperature of 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K, 973 K, 1173 K and 1273 K, the oxidation time of 0. 5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 10 h, 15 h, 20 h, 30 h, 40 h, and 50 h. The photocatalyst coatings showed the highest photocatalytic activity with the oxidation condition of 1073 K for 15 h. The metal powder of Ti, Ni and Cr had been used as the coating materials. The composite metal powder could affect the surface structure and photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the <b>melt</b> <b>salt</b> treatment with KNO 3 is an effective method to form the nano-size structure and enhance photocatalytic activity, especially under visible light...|$|R
