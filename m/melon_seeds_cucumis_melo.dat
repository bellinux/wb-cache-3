Leaves and seeds were used to produce extracts for each species at concentrations of a) 1 %, b) 0. 5 % c) 0. 25 %, d) 0. 125 % and e) 0 % (control). The experiment was conducted with each extract type and its respective concentrations in a completely randomized design, with four replicates, each of 20 seeds. The percentage emergence and rate index, percentage of abnormal seedlings, seedling dry matter and seedling shoot and root length were assessed. Seed extracts of A. cearensis prevented melon germination, whereas the other extracts had no effect on this variable. Leaf extracts of A. cearensis and leaf and seed extracts of Z. joazeiro, C. ferrea and E. velutina resulted in abnormal melon seedlings. The percentage of abnormal melon seedlings exceeded 30 % when treated with C. ferrea seed extract at the highest concentration. Most extracts did not affect seedling dry matter, but E. velutina leaf and seed extract increased the dry matter accumulation of melon seedlings and Z. joazeiro seed extract decreased dry matter accumulation at a concentration of 0. 25 %. The highest concentrations of mulungu and jucá leaf extracts promoted the shoot growth of melon seedlings. The extract from E. velutina seeds negatively affected root length compared to the control, similar to the effect of C. ferrea and E. velutina leaf extracts at the highest concentrations. Extracts of different organs of Caatinga plants can affect the emergence and characteristics related to seedling growth, depending on the concentration.

40|$|The use of food {{processing}} residues {{is a strategy}} to contribute to reducing waste and adding value to new products. Melon is a fruit consumed worldwide and its high consumption accompanies large amounts of residues, such as peel and seeds. The objective of this thesis was to add value to <b>melon</b> peel and <b>seeds</b> (<b>Cucumis</b> <b>melo</b> var. reticulatus), evidencing its nutritional properties, antioxidant capacity, anti-tumor effect, prebiotic potential and its capacity for enzyme production. Flours of <b>melon</b> peel and <b>seed</b> were elaborated using experimental design 22 to evaluate the factors of drying time and temperature, and the responses moisture, water activity and flour yield. Flour characterization was carried out using centesimal composition (moisture, ash, proteins, lipids, dietary fiber), fibrous fractions of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Flours were evaluated for their in vitro prebiotic properties using Bifidobacterium lactis in submerged fermentation and bile salt tolerance. The potential of the flours {{in the production of}} cellulases in semi-solid fermentation using Aspergillus oryzae fungus was also evaluated. For the accomplishment of the analyzes of antioxidant and antiproliferative power, aqueous extracts, hydrometanolic and hydroethanolic of the flours were prepared, characterized as monosaccharide composition, analysis of total sugars and proteins. For antioxidant evaluation, the total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, total carotenoids and tannins were determined. Phytochemical evaluation of the extracts was carried out by Thin Layer Chromatography. The antioxidant capacity evaluation was verified by the following in vitro tests: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, iron and copper metal chelation, sequestration of DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, and evaluation of the oxygenated radicals absorption capacity. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated using the tumor cell lines (SiHa, HeLa, 786 - 0 and HT 29) by colorimetric test of cell viability evaluation. The results for the drying experimental design showed that the temperature factor significantly influenced the yield response of the flours, being the test of 80 ºC for 24 h which presented better yield. Data showed that the melon residues had important nutritional characteristics for human consumption, with emphasis on dietary fiber content (51. 75 % for seed, 40. 57 % for peel), proteins (22 % for seed; 18 % for peel) and lipids (24 % for seed). The residues can be characterized as cellulosic material, with values of 35 % cellulose for <b>melon</b> <b>seed</b> and 19 % for peel. Satisfactory percentages of pectin were detected, being 28. 96 % for seed and 32. 65 % for melon peel. As for the prebiotic potential of the flour, it was observed that the fructo-oligosaccharide standard showed a growth of bifidobacteria of 12 LogUFCmL- 1, after 12 hours of fermentation, and the <b>melon</b> <b>seed</b> flour promoted bifidobacterial growth reaching 9. 9 LogUFCmL- 1, after 8 hours of culture, indicating prebiotic properties, with tolerance to the action of bile salts for up to 8 hours of fermentation. The melon peel did not provide growth of bifidobacteria. <b>Melon</b> peel and <b>seed</b> proved to be a good substrate for enzyme production. The best CMCase activity (1. 045 U / g) was verified on six days of fermentation and FPase (0. 190 U / g) after 96 h of fermentation with medium containing the peel and seed flours. In the evaluation of the extracts obtained from the melon residues, phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of compounds characteristic of phenolics, terpenes and saponins. Total phenolic compounds in aqueous, hydrometanolic, and hydroethanolic extracts of melon residue were quantified and expressed as gallic equivalents, highlighting peel extracts (1. 016 mg 100 g- 1). Total carotenoids, total flavonoids and tannins were also detected in extracts of melon residues, with emphasis on 96 μg of total carotenoids per gram of melon peel, 491 μg of catechin equivalents and 309 μg of catechin equivalents in 100 g extract dried of melon peel. The tests to evaluate the antioxidant activity revealed that all extracts presented antioxidant capacity. In the test of total antioxidant capacity (expressed as equivalent in ascorbic acid), hydroethanolic and methanolic extracts for peel and seed presented values of 89. 74 and 83 mg / g, respectively; 50. 56 % and methanolic 67. 7 % for melon peel. Reducing power and chelating abilities of copper and iron metals presented relevant data for both <b>melon</b> peel and <b>seed,</b> demonstrating an excellent antioxidant potential. The aqueous extract of the peel showed the ability of in vitro of copper ions chelation (84 %) and iron ions chelation (61 %). Scavenging activity of the DPPH radical was significant only for extracts of melon peel (29. 5 %). The cell viability test allowed us to observe that the extracts were able to extract the organic extracts, to significantly decrease the viability of the HeLa, SiHa and 786 - 0 cancer cells. Aqueous seed extracts at the 1. 0 mg / mL concentration inhibited the proliferation of SiHa cells by 80 % and the peel hydroethanolic extract (0. 25 mg / mL) inhibited by 80 % the viability of HeLa cells. For human renal tumor cells (786 - 0) all extracts at the concentration of 1. 0 mg / ml inhibited cell proliferation by more than 50 %. The extracts evaluated did not present significant inhibition activity of HT 29 cells. All <b>melon</b> peel and <b>seed</b> extracts weakly inhibited the proliferation of normal 3 t 3 fibroblasts (25 % inhibition). It is concluded that <b>melon</b> peels and <b>seeds</b> have antioxidant potential in vitro and antiproliferative effects in tumor cells. Flours of <b>melon</b> peel and <b>seed</b> may be substrates for the production of cellulolytic enzymes, in addition the seed flour showed in vitro prebiotic indication. Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) A utilização de resíduos do processamento de alimentos é uma estratégia para contribuir com a redução de desperdício e agregar valor a novos produtos. O melão é uma fruta consumida no mundo inteiro, destacando o Brasil, especialmente a região Nordeste. Seu elevado consumo acompanha grandes quantidades de resíduos, como cascas e sementes, provenientes do seu processamento. O objetivo desta tese foi agregar valor a cascas e sementes de melão (<b>Cucumis</b> <b>melo</b> var. reticulatus) evidenciando suas propriedades nutricionais, capacidade antioxidante, efeito anti-tumoral, propriedades prebióticas e seu potencial para produção de enzimas. Inicialmente foram elaboradas farinhas da casca e semente de melão utilizando planejamento experimental 22 avaliando os efeitos da temperatura e do tempo de secagem, e posterior caracterização química por análises de composição centesimal e de frações fibrosas. As farinhas foram avaliadas quanto as suas propriedades prebióticas in vitro utilizando Bifidobacterium lactis Bl 04 em fermentação submersa. Quanto ao potencial das farinhas na produção de enzimas celulolíticas utilizando os resíduos como substrato em fermentação semi-sólida do fungo Aspergillus oryzae ATCC 9362. Para realização das análises de poder antioxidante e antiproliferativo, foram preparados extratos aquosos, hidrometanólico e hidroetanólico das farinhas, caracterizados quanto à composição de monossacarídeos, análise de açúcares totais, proteínas, fenólicos totais, flavonóides totais, carotenóides totais e taninos; além de uma avaliação fitoquímica. A avaliação da capacidade antioxidante foi verificada por meio dos seguintes testes in vitro: capacidade antioxidante total (CAT), poder redutor, quelação de metais ferro e cobre, seqüestro dos radicais DPPH, hidroxila e superóxido, e avaliação da capacidade de absorção dos radicais oxigenados (teste ORAC). A atividade antiproliferativa foi avaliada utilizando as linhagens de células tumorais de carcinoma (SiHa) e adenocarcinoma de cólo de útero (HeLa), adenocarcinoma renal humano (786 - 0) e adenocarcinoma coloretal humano (HT- 29) por meio do ensaio do MTT. Um planejamento experimental para secagem dos resíduos para elaboração das farinhas demonstrou que o fator temperatura influenciou significativamente na resposta rendimento das farinhas de casca e semente de melão, sendo o ensaio de 80 ºC por 24 h o que apresentou melhor rendimento. Dados apontaram que as farinhas da casca e semente de melão possuem características nutricionais importantes à alimentação humana, com destaque para o conteúdo de fibra alimentar (51, 75 % para semente; 40, 57 % para casca), proteínas (22 % para semente; 18 % para casca) e lipídios (24 % para semente). Os resíduos podem ser caracterizados como material celulósico, com valores de 35 % de celulose para semente de melão e 19 % para casca. Foram detectados satisfatórios percentuais de pectina, sendo 28, 96 % para semente e 32, 65 % para casca de melão. Quanto ao potencial prebiótico das farinhas, observou-se que a farinha da semente de melão promoveu o crescimento bifidobacteriano alcançando 9, 9 Log UFCmL- 1, após 8 horas de cultivo, indicando propriedades prebióticas, com tolerância à ação de sais biliares por até 8 horas de fermentação. A farinha da casca de melão não proporcionou crescimento de bifidobactéria. As farinhas de casca e semente de melão demonstraram ser um bom substrato para produção de enzimas. A melhor atividade de CMCase (1, 045 U / g) foi verificada em seis dias de fermentação e FPase (0, 190 U / g) após 96 h de cultivo com meio contendo as farinhas de casca e semente. Na avaliação dos extratos obtidos a partir da casca e semente de melão, detectaram-se baixos teores de glicose, frutose e sacarose, com média de 0, 8 % de açúcares totais para extratos da casca e 0, 7 % para extratos da semente. Os extratos hidrometanólicos da casca e da semente obtiveram maiores percentuais de proteínas, 11, 9 % e 18 %, respectivamente. A análise fitoquímica indicou a presença de compostos fenólicos, terpenos e saponinas. Compostos fenólicos totais em extratos aquosos, hidrometanólicos, e hidroetanólicos da farinha do resíduo de melão foram quantificados e expressos em equivalentes de ácido gálico, destacando os extratos da casca (1, 016 mg 100 g- 1). Carotenóides totais, flavonóides totais e taninos também foram detectados nos extratos dos resíduos de melão, com destaque para 96 μg de carotenóides totais por grama de casca de melão, 491 μg de equivalentes de catequinas e 309 μg de equivalentes de catequinas em 100 g de extrato seco da casca de melão. Os testes para avaliação da atividade antioxidante revelaram que todos os extratos de casca e semente de melão apresentam capacidade antioxidante. No CAT expresso como equivalente em ácido ascórbico, os extratos hidroetanólico e metanólico para casca e semente apresentaram valores de 89, 74 e 83 mg /g, respectivamente. Foi verificada capacidade de seqüestro de radical hidroxila para extratos hidroetanólico (50, 56 %) e metanólico (67, 7 %) para casca de melão. Ensaios de poder redutor e habilidade de quelação dos metais cobre e ferro apresentaram, tanto para casca quanto para semente de melão, um excelente potencial antioxidante. O extrato aquoso da casca demonstrou habilidade de quelação in vitro de íons cobre (84 %) e quelação de íons ferro (61 %). Atividade de seqüestro do radical DPPH foi significativa somente para os extratos da casca de melão (29, 5 %). Valores de ORAC foram importantes principalmente para os extratos etanólico e metanólico dos resíduos, com destaque para o extrato hidroetanólico da semente (22 mmol de Trolox em 100 g de extrato seco). O teste de viabilidade celular, possibilitou observar que os extratos foram capazes de diminuir significativamente a viabilidade das células cancerígenas HeLa, SiHa e 786 - 0. O extratos aquoso da semente na concentração 1, 0 mg/mL inibiu a proliferação de células SiHa em 80 % e o extrato hidroetanólico da casca (0, 25 mg/ mL) inibiu em 80 % a viabilidade de células HeLa. Para as células 786 - 0 todos os extratos na concentração de 1, 0 mg/mL inibiram a proliferação celular em mais de 50 %. Os extratos avaliados não apresentaram atividade significativa de inibição da viabilidade de células HT 29. Todos os extratos da casca e semente de melão inibiram fracamente a proliferação de fibroblastos normais 3 t 3 (25 % de inibição). Conclui-se que cascas e sementes de melão possuem potencial antioxidante in vitro e efeitos antiproliferativos em células tumorais. Farinhas de casca e semente de melão podem ser substratos para produção de enzimas celulolíticas, além de que a farinha da semente apresentou indicação prebiótica in vitro...|$|R

Acid value (AV), Iodine value (IV), Peroxide value, Reichert-Meissl value (RMV), Thiocyanogen value (TV), Titre value etc. were determined and found that lightly changed due to variation of storage time. Acid value and Peroxide value were increased with the increasing of storage time but RMV, TV, IV, and Titre value were decreased, which indicates that the quality of the oil deteriorates with increasing time of storage. Fatty acid composition of the oil was determined by Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC) and identified the presence of palmitic acid, stearic acid, linolenic acid and oleic acid in the oil. The low acid value of oil indicates that it can be used in edible purpose.
