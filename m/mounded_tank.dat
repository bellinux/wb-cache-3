60|$|Soon after daylight, the nabob's troops {{moved out}} from their intrenchments, and {{it was evident that}} he was aware of the {{position}} of the English. The French, with their four field guns, took up their post on the <b>mound</b> of the <b>tank</b> nearest to the grove, and about half a mile distant from it; and in the narrow space between them and the river two heavy guns, under a native officer, were placed.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} annual variations of temperature and the corresponding saturation pressure of saturated liquid propane in a <b>mounded</b> cylindrical <b>tank</b> used for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage. A mathematical model has been established based on a finite volume method. Boundary and initial conditions have been assumed for the Croatian climate. Simulations have been performed using the commercial CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) code on the representative numerical example. Analysis results have been presented through diagrams. It has been {{pointed out that the}} present regulation and practice for such tanks defines too high a design pressure of 1. 64 MPa for the Croatian climate and that pressure of 1. 2 MPa is sufficient to ensure proper design of such vessels. Significant simplifications and savings in production process can be achieved by changing the unnecessarily high design pressure...|$|R
40|$|High level waste tanks 18 F and 19 F have {{residual}} {{mounds of}} waste which may require removal before the tanks can be closed. Conventional slurry pump technology, previously used for waste removal and tank cleaning, has been incapable of removing theses <b>mounds</b> from <b>tanks</b> 18 F and 19 F. A mechanical cleaning method {{has been identified}} that is potentially capable of removing and transferring the <b>mound</b> material to <b>tank</b> 7 F for incorporation in a sludge batch for eventual disposal in high level waste glass by the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The Savannah River National Laboratory has been requested to evaluate whether the material transferred from tanks 18 F/ 19 F by the mechanical cleaning technology can later be suspended in Tank 7 F by conventional slurry pumps after mixing with high level waste sludge. The proposed mechanical cleaning process for removing the waste <b>mounds</b> from <b>tanks</b> 18 and 19 may utilize a high pressure water jet-eductor that creates a vacuum to mobilize solids. The high pressure jet {{is also used to}} transport the suspended solids. The jet-eductor system will be mounted on a mechanical crawler for movement around the bottom of tanks 18 and 19. Based on physical chemical property testing of the jet-eductor system processed IE- 95 zeolite and size-reduced IE- 95 zeolite, the following conclusions were made: (1) The jet-eductor system processed zeolite has a mean and median particle size (volume basis) of 115. 4 and 43. 3 microns in water. Preferential settling of these large particles is likely. (2) The jet-eductor system processed zeolite rapidly generates settled solid yield stresses in excess of 11, 000 Pascals in caustic supernates and will not be easily retrieved from Tank 7 with the existing slurry pump technology. (3) Settled size-reduced IE- 95 zeolite (less than 38 microns) in caustic supernate does not generate yield stresses in excess of 600 Pascals in less than 30 days. (4) Preferential settling of size-reduced zeolite {{is a function of the}} amount of sludge and the level of dilution for the mixture. (5) Blending the size-reduced zeolite into larger quantities of sludge can reduce the amount of preferential settling. (6) Periodic dilution or resuspension due to sludge washing or other mixing requirements will increase the chances of preferential settling of the zeolite solids. (7) Mixtures of Purex sludge and size-reduced zeolite did not produce yield stresses greater than 200 Pascals for settling times less than thirty days. Most of the sludge-zeolite blends did not exceed 50 Pascals. These mixtures should be removable by current pump technology if sufficient velocities can be obtained. (8) The settling rate of the sludge-zeolite mixtures is a function of the ionic strength (or supernate density) and the zeolite- sludge mixing ratio. (9) Simulant tests indicate that leaching of Si may be an issue for the processed <b>Tank</b> 19 <b>mound</b> material. (10) Floating zeolite fines observed in water for the jet-eductor system and size-reduced zeolite were not observed when the size-reduced zeolite was blended with caustic solutions, indicating that the caustic solutions cause the fines to agglomerate. Based on the test programs described in this report, the potential for successfully removing Tank 18 / 19 <b>mound</b> material from <b>Tank</b> 7 with the current slurry pump technology requires the reduction of the particle size of the Tank 18 / 19 mound material...|$|R
50|$|Tanks {{are part}} of an ancient {{tradition}} of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall and water from streams and rivers for later use, primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing and ritual.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} by SRR to provide sample preparation {{and analysis of}} the Tank 5 F final characterization samples to determine the residual tank inventory prior to grouting. Two types of samples were collected and delivered to SRNL: floor samples across the tank and subsurface samples from mounds near risers 1 and 5 of Tank 5 F. These samples were taken from Tank 5 F between January and March 2011. These samples from individual locations in the tank (nine floor samples and six <b>mound</b> <b>Tank</b> 5 F samples) were each homogenized and combined in a given proportion into 3 distinct composite samples to mimic the average composition in the entire tank. These Tank 5 F composite samples were analyzed for radiological, chemical and elemental components. Additional measurements performed on the Tank 5 F composite samples include bulk density and water leaching of the solids to account for water soluble species. With analyses for certain challenging radionuclides as the exception, all composite Tank 5 F samples were analyzed and reported in triplicate. The target detection limits for isotopes analyzed were based on customer desired detection limits as specified in the technical task request documents. SRNL developed new methodologies to meet these target detection limits and provide data for the extensive suite of components. While many of the target detection limits were met for the species characterized for Tank 5 F, as specified in the technical task request, some were not met. In a few cases, the relatively high levels of radioactive species of the same element or a chemically similar element precluded the ability to measure some isotopes to low levels. The Technical Task Request allows that while the analyses of these isotopes is needed, meeting the detection limits for these isotopes is a lower priority than meeting detection limits for the other specified isotopes. The isotopes whose detection limits were not met in all cases included the following: Al- 26, Sn- 126, Sb- 126, Sb- 126 m, Eu- 152 and Cf- 249. SRNL, in conjunction with the plant customer, reviewed all these cases and determined that the impacts were negligible...|$|R

40|$|Data {{recovery}} investigations at the Tank Destroyer site (41 CV 1378) {{were conducted}} in August 2007 for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). This work was required because of potential impacts to the site from TxDOT’s planned improvements of Tank Destroyer Boulevard and State Highway 9. The investigations focused on a burned rock mound (Feature 1), one-half {{of which has been}} destroyed by an adjacent <b>tank</b> trail. The <b>mound</b> contained two internal features: an off-centered earth oven and a small cluster of Rabdotus sp. shells. With the exception of the location of its earth oven, the <b>mound</b> at the <b>Tank</b> Destroyer is typical of a classic central Texas domed mound, though slightly flattened by postdepositional processes. In all, an area of 30. 5 m 2 and volume of 11. 8 m 3 of cultural deposits were hand excavated, and an additional ca. 17. 3 m 2 was mechanically stripped. The mound excavations yielded 5, 570. 5 kg of burned rocks. Artifacts recovered from mound and nonmound contexts consist of 129 chipped stone tools, 9 cores and core fragments, 4, 466 pieces of unmodified debitage, 1 ground stone tool, 2 unmodified bone fragments, 1, 415 Rabdotus sp. shells, and 40 historic artifacts. In addition, 413 pieces of microdebitage and 251 Rabdotus sp. shells were recovered from flotation and soil column samples taken from the mound. There was virtually no preservation of vertebrate faunal remains and poor preservation of botanical remains. No economic plants (i. e., food resources) were recovered despite the collection and processing of flotation samples. Sixteen radiocarbon assays on charred wood and Rabdotus sp. shells date the site occupation to 1500 b. c. through a. d. 1650. The date range for the diagnostic projectile points recovered from the site (200 b. c. to a. d. 1200) fits nicely within the range of radiocarbon dates. As a group, the radiocarbon dates and the projectile points suggest that the most intensive period of site use occurred intermittently between 1000 b. c. and a. d. 1200. Like most burned rock mounds, the <b>mound</b> at the <b>Tank</b> Destroyer site consisted of a jumbled mass of burned rocks that episodically accreted around an earth oven. These processes and repeated use over centuries limit our ability to recognize distinct components for analysis. Given these limitations, our analysis took a different approach. While it includes traditional analyses of the lithic, burned rock, and snail assemblages, it also examines social identity during the Late Archaic period in central Texas and the relationships between burned rock mounds and middens and environmental variables through a landscape analysis...|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{planning}} to initiate vitrification of Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) in combination with Sludge Batch 2 (SB 2) {{in the spring of}} 2004. The contents of Sludge Batch 3 will be a mixture of the heel remaining from Sludge Batch 1 B, sludge from Tank 7 F (containing coal, sand, and sodium oxalate), and sludge materials from Tank 18 F. The sludge materials in Tank 18 F contain part of a mound of zeolitic material transferred there from Tank 19 F. This mound was physically broken up and transfers were made from Tank 19 F to Tank 18 F for vitrification into SB 3. In addition, excess Pu and Am/Cm materials were transferred to Tank 51 H to be processed through the DWPF as part of SB 3. Additional Pu material and a Np stream from the Canyons are also planned to be added to SB 3 before processing of this batch commences at DWPF. The primary objective of this task was to assess the impacts of the excess zeolite <b>mound</b> material in <b>Tank</b> 19 F on the predicted glass and processing properties of interest when the zeolite becomes part of SB 3. The two potential impacts of the Tank 19 F zeolite mound on DWPF processing relates to (1) the samples taken for determination of the acceptability of a macrobatch of DWPF feed and (2) the achievable waste loading. The potential effects of the large size of the zeolite particles found in the Tank 19 F solids, as reported in this study, are considered minimal for processing of SB 3 in DWPF. Other findings about the zeolite conversion mechanism via a process of Ostwald ripening are discussed in the text and in the conclusions...|$|R
40|$|What is a mound system? A septic <b>tank</b> <b>mound</b> {{system is}} a {{technology}} used for treating and disposing of domestic wastewater in areas unsuitable for conventional septic tank soil absorption systems. Mounds are pressure-dosed sand filters placed above, and discharging directly to, the natural soil. Their main purpose is to provide additional treatment to the wastewater before it enters the natural environment. Mound systems are designed to overcome site restrictions such as: • slow or fast permeability soils, • shallow soil cover over creviced or porous bedrock, and • a high water table. The three components of a mound system are a pretreatment unit(s), dosing chamber, and the elevated mound. See Figure 1 on page 2 for an illustration. The pretreatment unit is usually a septic tank, which removes solids from the wastewater. The dosing chamber follows the septic tank and contains a pump, which uses pressure to evenly distribute the wastewater over the infiltration surface of the mound. The mound {{is made up of}} a soil cover that can support vegetation and a fabriccovered coarse gravel aggregate in which a network of small diameter perforated pipe is placed. The network of perforated pipe is designed to distribute the effluent evenly through the gravel from where it trickles down to the sand media and hence, into the plowed basal area (natural soil). Treatment occurs through physical, biological, and chemical means as the wastewater filters down through the sand and the natural soil. What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using mound systems? Advantages • The mound system enables use of land that would otherwise be unsuitable for inground or at-grade onsite systems. • The natural soil utilized in a mound system is usually the top layer, which is typically the most permeable. A General Overview • A mound system does not have a direct discharge to a ditch, stream, or other body of water. • If care is taken, construction damage can be minimized since there is little excavation required in the mound area. • Mounds can be utilized in most climates...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} methods {{were used to}} develop and recommend a slurry pump operational strategy for sludge heel removal in Tank 11. Flow patterns calculated by the model were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of various combinations of operating pumps and their orientation. The models focused on removal of the sludge heel located at the edge of Tank 11 using the four existing slurry pumps. The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Tank Closure Project (TCP) Engineering. Computational {{fluid dynamics}} models of Tank 11 with different operating conditions were developed using the FLUENT(tm) code. The modeling results were used to assess the efficiency of sludge suspension and removal operations in the 75 -ft tank. The models employed a three-dimensional approach, a two-equation turbulence model, and an approximate representation of flow obstructions. The calculated local velocity was used as a measure of sludge removal and mixing capability. For the simulations, a series of the modeling calculations was performed with indexed pump orientations until an efficient flow pattern near the potential location of the sludge mound was established for sludge removal. The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 1600 rpm could remove the sludge <b>mound</b> from the <b>tank</b> with a 103 in. liquid level, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft/sec. In this case, the only exception is the region within about 2 ft. from the tank wall. Further results showed that the capabilities of sludge removal were affected by the indexed pump orientation, the number of operating pumps, and the pump speed. A recommended operational strategy for an efficient flow pattern was developed to remove the sludge mound assuming that local fluid velocity {{can be used as a}} measure of sludge suspension and removal. Sensitivity results showed that for a given pump speed, a higher tank level and a lower pump nozzle elevation would result in better performance in suspending and removing the sludge. The results also showed that the presence of flow obstructions such as valve housing structure were advantageous for certain pump orientations...|$|R
