The occurrence of stream segments depends on the nature and structure of rocks, vegetation cover, nature and amount of rainfall, and soil permeability. Table  4 indicating stream frequency of third-order sub-watersheds varies from 0.92 to 2.05, fourth-order sub-watersheds varies 1.12 and 1.22. In Budigere, Amanikere watershed shows 1.17 of low (below 2.5 /km 2) stream frequency of low relief and high infiltration capacity of the bedrock pointing towards the increase in stream population with respect to increase in drainage density. The stream frequency of Budigere Amanikere basin shows that the basin has good vegetation, medium relief, high infiltration capacity, and later peak discharges owing to low runoff rate. The stream frequency shows positive correlation with the drainage density. Lesser the drainage density and stream frequency in a basin, the runoff is slower, and therefore, flooding is less likely in basins with a low to <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> density and stream frequency (Carlston 1963).|$|E

In the present study, morphometric analysis and its influence on hydrology were carried out in Makhawan watershed, Central India, using SRTM, remote sensing and GIS. SRTM data were used for preparation of DEM, slope and aspect maps. DEM was used to delineate the watershed limits and to extract the channel network, which was later updated using IRS 1 D LISS III data. The hydrological module in ArcGIS was used for calculation of watershed and morphometric parameters, under linear, relief and aerial aspects. The watershed shows dendritic-to-sub-dendritic drainage pattern; however, parallel-to-sub-parallel pattern developed locally which may be due to rejuvenation of streams in mature stage with <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> texture. High drainage density in the watershed is observed over impermeable subsurface material, sparse vegetation with high relief; whereas, low drainage density is found over permeable subsurface material and low relief.

The sediments within the lake aid in the dispersion of these metals. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate and map the spatial distribution of heavy metals in Burullus Lake sediments. Accordingly, 37 locations were randomly distributed within the lake. Sediment samples were taken from these locations. These samples were analyzed for seven metals including Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr, Co, Cd and Pb. Also, five indices were used to identify the status of metal pollutants in the Lake. These indices are: enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (DC), pollution load index (PLI) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo). Ordinary Kriging was used to interpolate the spatial distribution of the studied elements within the lake.

The bifurcation ratio and stream numbers of the watershed show vulnerability for unpredicted flood during heavy rainfall. The value of mean bifurcation ratio is indicating that the watershed is not affected by structural disturbances and geological structures.

30|$|Drainage texture (Rt) {{is one of}} the {{important}} concepts of geomorphology which means the relative spacing of drainage lines. According to Horton (1945), Rt is the total number of stream segments of all orders per perimeter of that area. The observed Rt is 5.99 which indicates the <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> texture. The <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> texture and lower value of drainage density (2.02) indicate the presence of highly resistant permeable material with low relief (Table  4). Low drainage density and moderately drainage texture indicate the presence of permeable soil strata within the watershed. Texture ratio depends on the underlying lithology of the area, the infiltration capacity and relief aspect of the watershed terrain. The present area has a texture ratio of 4.45 and hence shows a moderate nature. Form factor (Horton 1932) is a ratio of the basin area to square of the basin length. The area, perimeter and length of the watershed are basic measurements which are useful in generating dimensionless ratios for indexing the watershed shape. The R f value for the watershed is 0.211 which suggests its elongated shape. A watershed with low form factor and an elongated shape denotes its flatter peak of flow for long period. A flood flow for such an elongated shape will be easier to manage in due course of time (Table  4). Elongation ratio is defined as the ratio between the diameter of the circle of the similar area as of the drainage basin with a maximum length equal to that of the basin (Schumn 1956). Depending on the climatic and geological conditions of the area, the value of the Re varies considerably between 0.6 and 1.0, those with value close to the highest, i.e. 1.0 are categorized as typical low relief and with value of 0.6 and nearby are associated with high relief and steep slope (Strahler 1964). The values are grouped in all as three categories: circular (with values > 0.9), oval (0.8  ≤ value ≤  0.9) and elongated (value < 0.8). The elongation ratio of the current study area is 0.518 which places it in the category of elongated basin (Table  4). Miller (1953) defined a dimensionless circularity ratio (Rc) as the ratio of the basin area to the area of circle having the same perimeter as the basin. Rc was influenced by the length and frequency of streams, geological structures, land use/land cover, climate, relief and slope of the basin. Circularity ratios range 0.4 to 0.5 which indicate strongly elongated and highly permeable homogenous geology, and the observed circularity ratio of the basin is 0.344 (Table  3) which indicates that the basin is elongated in shape, low discharge of runoff and highly permeability of the subsoil condition.|$|E
3000|$|The {{present study}} area {{proved that the}} GIS and RS {{technique}} used for computation and analysis of various morphometric parameters of the basin and helps to understand various terrain parameters such as nature of the bedrock, infiltration capacity, surface runoff, etc. The Shanur River is well drained in nature with the stream order varying from 1 to 4. The basin is dominated by lower order streams and the total length of stream segments. Stream frequency and drainage density is the prime criterion for the morphometric classification of drainage basins, which certainly control the runoff pattern, sediment yield, and other hydrological parameters of the drainage basin. The detailed study shows 19 morphometric parameters that have been calculated {{with the help of}} Arc GIS- 10 software. The bifurcation ratio ranges is 3.5 – 4.71 and the total bifurcation ratio is 12.57. The quantitative analysis of linear, relief and aerial parameters using GIS and RS techniques is found to be of immense utility in river basin evaluation, basin prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resource management. The bifurcation ratio in the basin indicates normal basin category and the presence of <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> density suggesting that, it is moderate permeable subsoil and coarse drainage texture. The morphometric analysis of the drainage network of the basin show dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage patterns with <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> texture. The variation in stream length ratio might be due to change in slope and topography. The morphometric analysis is carried out in 4 stream order of Shanur River Basin using GIS and RS techniques for determining the linear aspects such as stream order, bifurcation ratio, stream length and L u/S u. The difference in stream length ratio might be due to changes in slope and topography. The basin is having moderate to high relief of the terrain and elongated in shape. The higher drainage density indicates that the sub-basin is impermeable subsoil and sparse vegetation cover. The Channel index (C [...] i [...]), Valley index (V [...] i [...]), Rho coefficient (ρ) and minimum aerial distance (A dm) Kms values are 0.38, 1.14, 0.31, and 38.42, respectively, indicating that the Shanur River Basin is elongated in shape, with high discharge of runoff and impermeable subsoil condition. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have best efficient tool in drainage delineation. The conventional methods of morphometric analysis are time-consuming and error prone, while use of GIS method allows for more reliable and accurate estimation of similar parameters of Shanur River Basin. The first and second stream order is a high priority stream and is prone to comparatively higher erosion and soil loss. Geological field verification also agrees with the present morphological-based prioritization. Hence, appropriate soil erosion control measures are required in this basin to conserve the land from further erosion.|$|E

This problem of conversion is most germane to hydrologic analyses for <b>moderate</b> to large <b>drainage</b> basins, where point rainfall depths are not representative of the spatial distribution of a storm event. Historically, depth-area relationships have been developed {{on the basis of}} data from dense networks of recording gauges.

Data analyzed for this study are those recorded for the Arkansas-Red Basin River Forecast Center (ABRFC), and span the period of time from May 1993, to September 2000. Conclusions of this study are that data heterogeneities and shortness of data records are major factors limiting development of depth-area relationships on the basis of radar-rainfall data. Possible biases in radar estimates of extreme rainfall are also of concern.

40|$|ObjectiveParaplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (TAAA) repair mainly occurs {{in patients with}} Crawford extent I and II. We assessed the impact of monitoring spinal cord integrity and the subsequent adjusted surgical maneuvers on neurologic outcome in repairs of type I and II TAAAs. MethodsSurgical repair of TAAAs was performed in 112 consecutive patients with extent type I (n = 42) and type II (n = 70) aneurysms. The surgical protocol included cerebrospinal fluid <b>drainage,</b> <b>moderate</b> hypothermia, and left heart bypass with selective organ perfusion. Spinal cord function was assessed by means of monitoring motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Significant decreased MEPs always generated adjustments, including raising distal aortic and mean arterial pressure, reattachment of visible intercostal arteries, or endarterectomy of the excluded aortic segment with revascularization of back bleeding intercostal arteries. ResultsMotor evoked potential monitoring could be achieved in all patients. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were adequate in 82 % of patients. Increasing distal aortic pressure restored MEPs in all patients. In 19 patients (17 %), MEPs decreased significantly during aortic cross-clamping because of critical spinal cord ischemia. MEPs returned in all patients after spinal cord blood flow was re-established except in three patients with type II TAAA in whom MEPs could not be restored, and absent MEPs {{at the end of}} the procedure corresponded with neurologic deficit. Delayed paraplegia developed in two patients owing to hemodynamic instability with insufficient mean arterial blood pressure to maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion. ConclusionMonitoring MEPs is a highly reliable technique to assess spinal cord ischemia during TAAA repair. A surgical protocol including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, left heart bypass, and monitoring of MEPs can reduce the paraplegia rate significantly. Adjusted hemodynamic and surgical strategies induced by changes in MEPs could restore spinal cord ischemia in most patients, preventing early and late paraplegia in all type I patients. In type II patients, early paraplegia occurred in 4. 2 % and delayed neurologic deficit in 2. 9 %. Despite all available measures, complete prevention of paraplegia in type II aneurysms seems to be unrealistic...|$|R

40|$|Fens in Central Europe are characterised by {{waterlogged}} {{organic substrate}} and low productivity. Human-induced changes due to drainage and mowing lead {{to changes in}} plant species composition from natural fen communities to fen meadows and later to over-drained, degraded meadows. <b>Moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> leads to increased vegetation productivity, and severe drainage results in frequent soil disturbances and less plant growth. In the present article, we analyse changes in plant trait combinations in the vegetation and the soil seed bank as well as changes in the seed bank types along gradient of drainage intensity. We hypothesize that an increase in productivity enhances traits related to persistence and that frequent disturbance selects for regeneration traits. We use multivariate statistics to analyse data from three disturbance levels: undisturbed fen, slightly drained fen meadow and severely drained degraded meadow. We found that the abundance of plants regenerating from seeds and accumulating persistent seed banks was increasing with degradation level, while plants reproducing vegetatively were gradually eliminated along the same trajectory. Plants with strong resprouting abilities increased during degradation. We also found that shifts in trait combinations were similar in the aboveground vegetation and in soil seed banks. We found that the density of short-term persistent seeds in the soil is highest in fen meadows and the density of long-term persistent seeds is highest in degraded meadows.

Class B, profile with <b>moderate</b> or imperfect <b>drainage,</b> and presence of gley. Class C, thickness of horizon A equal or lower than 17 cm. Well or somewhat excessively drained. Unmottled profile, without gley or risk of flooding. Agricultural requirements were determined for the most important crops in the area: banana plant (Musa spp.) under irrigation, sugar cane (Sacharum officinarum) under irrigation and mechanized production of maize (Zea mays) under irrigation. Evaluation of the land was accomplished using the maximum limitation method. The characteristics of the three soil classes were compared on agricultural use, obtaining their physical aptitudes. For each type of physical aptitude (qualitative) one quantitative type was estimated according to the expected crop yield. It is concluded that, according to the agronomic limitations, the soil class C showed better physical aptitude than soil class A, which resulted better than soil class B, for the three suitable agricultural uses...|$|R
40|$|The use of on-site {{wastewater}} treatment {{systems for the}} treatment and dispersal of domestic effluent is common in urban fringe areas which are not serviced by centralised wastewater collection systems. However, due to inappropriate siting and inadequate evaluation of soil characteristics, the failure of these systems has become a common scenario. The current standards and guidelines adopted by many local authorities for assessing suitable site and soil conditions for on-site dispersal areas are coming under increasing scrutiny due to the public health and environmental impacts caused by poorly performing systems, in particular septic tank-soil adsorption systems. In order to achieve sustainable on-site {{wastewater treatment}} with minimal impacts {{on the environment and}} public health, more appropriate means of assessment of long term performance of on-site dispersal areas are required. The research described in the thesis details the investigations undertaken for the development of robust assessment criteria for on-site dispersal area siting and design and assessment of the long term performance of soil dispersal areas. The research undertaken focused on three key research areas; (i) assessment of site and soil suitability for providing adequate treatment and dispersal of domestic wastewater; (ii) understanding sorption, purification and transport processes influencing retention and release of pollutants and the natural controls governing these processes and (iii) the development of assessment criteria for long term behaviour of soils under effluent dispersal. The research conducted was multidisciplinary in nature, with detailed investigations of the physical and chemical processes involved in on-site wastewater treatment and dispersal. This involved extensive field investigations, sampling and monitoring, laboratory and soil column testing and detailed data analysis across the fields of soil science, groundwater quality, subsurface hydrology, chemical contamination, and contaminant fate and transport processes. The interactions between these different disciplines can be complex which resulted in substantial amounts of data being generated from the numerous field and laboratory investigations and sampling undertaken. In order to understand the complex relationships that can occur, multivariate statistical techniques were utilised. The use of these techniques was extremely beneficial. These techniques not only allowed not only the respective relationships between investigated parameters to be identified, but also adequate decisions based on the correlations were able to be formulated. This allowed a more appropriate assessment of the influential factors, and the prediction of ongoing changes to soil properties due to effluent disposal. The primary outcomes for this research were disseminated through a series of peer reviewed scientific papers centred on these key disciplines. The assessment of site and soil suitability was achieved through extensive soil sampling throughout the study areas and detailed laboratory testing and data analysis. The study identified and investigated the role of influential site and soil characteristics in the treatment performance of subsurface effluent dispersal areas. The extent of effluent travel and the ability of the soil to remove pollutants contained in the effluent by adsorption and/or nutrient uptake were investigated. A framework for assessing the renovation ability of the major soil groups located throughout Southeast Queensland was also developed. The outcomes provide a more rigorous scientific basis for assessing the ability of soil and evaluating site factors to develop more reliable methods for siting effluent dispersal areas. The resulting assessment criteria developed was compared with soil column studies to determine the robustness and validity of the outcomes. This allowed refinement of the assessment criteria in developing a more reliable approach to predicting long term behaviour of soils under sewage effluent dispersal. Multivariate techniques assisted in characterising appropriate soils and to determine their long-term suitability for effluent treatment and dispersal. The assessment criteria developed included physical, chemical and sub-surface hydrological properties of a site and soil which can be used to predict suitability for long term effluent treatment and dispersal. These include: 	<b>Moderate</b> to slow <b>drainage</b> (permeability) to assist the movement of effluent (percolation) through the soil profile and allow adequate time for treatment and dispersal to occur. With longer percolation times, the opportunity for exchange and transport processes increase. 	Significant soil cation exchange capacity and dominance of exchangeable Ca 2 + or exchangeable Mg 2 + over exchangeable Na+. Although a soil dominated by Mg 2 + is found to promote dispersion of soil particles to some extent, its impact is far less than that of Na+. A stable soil would have a Ca: Mg ratio > 0. 5. 	Low exchangeable Na+ content to maintain soil stability. 	Minimum depth of 400 mm of potentially unsaturated soil before encountering a restrictive horizon, to permit adequate purification to take place. 	Clay type with Illite and mixed mineralogy soils being the most sensitive to Na+. In general, significant increases in ESP occur in soils with 30 to 40...|$|R
40|$|The {{study area}} {{is a part of}} Kagna river basin in the Gulburga {{district}} of Karnataka, India. It covers an area of 1320 km(2) and it has been subdivided into 4 sub-basins namely Wadi, Chitapur, Sedam and Kurkunta, which range in area from 184 to 537 km(2). The drainage pattern of these sub-basins are delineated using Geo-coded FCC bands 2, 3, 4 of IRS 1 C and 1 D(LISS III+PAN merged) on 1 : 50, 000 scale and Survey of India toposheets as reference. The morphometric parameters are computed using ArcInfo and ArcView GIS softwares. The drainage pattern of the study area is dendritic to sub-dendritic with stream orders ranging from IV to VII orders. Drainage density ranges from 1. 40 to 1. 86 km/km(2) suggesting coarse to <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> texture. The change in values of stream length ratio indicate their late youth stage of geomorphic development. The values of bifurcation ratio ranging from 2. 00 to 4. 71 indicate that all the sub-basins fall under normal basin category. The values of form factor and circulatory ratio, suggest that the Kurkunta sub-basin is elongated and the remaining sub-basins are more or less circular in shape. Elongation ratio indicates that the Wadi sub-basin is a region of very low relief whereas the other sub-basins are associated with moderate to high relief and steep ground slopes. It is concluded that remote sensing and GIS have been proved to be efficient tools in drainage delineation and updation. In the present study these updated drainages have been used for the morphometric analysis...|$|E
30|$|Drainage {{density is}} a measure to analyze the length of {{different}} streams per unit area, and it is obtained by dividing the total stream length by the total watershed area. The drainage density values estimated for the various watersheds {{of the study area}} are given in Table  3. It is observed that the drainage density varies from a minimum of 1.33  km− 1 (watershed 9) to a maximum of 6.04  km− 1 (watershed 32). In the study area, the drainage density values were found to be low (<[*] 1.5  km per km 2) for watersheds 6, 9, 10, 19 and 23. On the other hand, drainage density was found to be high (>[*] 3.5  km per km 2) for watersheds 12, 15, 26 and 32. For rest of the watersheds, the drainage density was found to be <b>moderate.</b> <b>Drainage</b> density has increasingly been appreciated to be a fundamental indicator of a drainage watershed and a valuable index of drainage watershed process like erosion and sediment output (Morisawa and Clayton 1985). Drainage density (Dd) helps to identify the landscape dissection, runoff potential, infiltration capacity of the land, climatic conditions and vegetation cover of the basin (Verstappen 1983; Macke 2001; Reddy et al. 2004). Patton (1988) has observed that the areas of high drainage density are a result of erosion and dissection by overland flow, low drainage density areas are the product of runoff possess dominated by infiltration and sub-surface flow. By considering the above views, it is observed that in the watersheds of the study area where the drainage density values are high (>[*] 3.5  km/sq.km) viz. watersheds 12, 15, 26 and 32, overland flow is dominant whereas the watersheds of 6, 9, 10, 19 and 23 (where drainage density is relatively low) infiltration and sub-surface flow are dominant.|$|E

The morphometric parameters are computed using Arc Info and Arc View GIS software’s. The drainage pattern of the study has shown dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern with stream orders ranging from 4 th to 5 th order.

The change in values of stream length ratio indicates their late youth stage of geomorphic development. The values of bifurcation ratio are ranging from 0. 11 to 20. 75 indicating that the study area is having strong structural control over the drainage pattern and all the sub basins fall under normal basin category. The values of form factor and circulatory ratio, suggest that the sub basins are elongated to circular in shape. Geographic Information System, when used with satellite images, could help in determining the morphometric parameters of watershed and river basins.

40|$|Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops grown in the highlands of Wollo. Yield in the country is generally very low, and diseases represent one of the major production constraints. In Ethiopia, a great variety of diseases affects faba bean production. However, gall forming faba bean new disease has become a very serious disease that seriously affected faba bean producing areas. To study the status of this disease in the highlands of Wollo, a survey was conducted in six major faba bean producing districts of Wollo during the main cropping season of 2012 and 2013. A total of 119 farmers’ fields were visited to determine the incidence and severity of faba bean gall forming new disease. The level of incidence was high in all the five districts, namely Gubalafito, Meket, Woreilu, Wadila, Jama, Legehida and Dessie Zuria. The level of disease severity ranged from 9. 9 and 59. 3 %, while the incidence varied from 50 to 100 %. The mean differences in incidence and severity within the districts variable classes, altitude, varieties, growth stage, plant population, planting date, previous crop, weed population and soil type were high. The independent variables: districts, altitude, growth stage, plant population, previous crops, weed population, drainage system and soil types were significantly associated with high incidence and severity of faba bean new disease as single predictor in the logistic regression model. A reduced multiple variable model was fitted using districts, altitude, growth stage, plant population, previous crop, weed population, soil type and drainage system as independent variables. High severity (> 5 %) had a high probability of association to all independent variables, except previous crop. There were about 1. 44, 2. 42 and 2. 44 times higher probabilities that faba bean new disease severity exceeded 5 % in dense plant population compared to low plant population, high weed population compared to low weed density and bad drainage system compared to <b>moderate</b> <b>drainage</b> system fields, respectively...|$|E
