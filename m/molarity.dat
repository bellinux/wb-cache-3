40|$|Background/purpose: To {{describe}} {{the water and}} ion transport through the skin under different conditions, we developed a three-component mixture model. This model has proven to {{describe the}} transient change in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after a change in relative humidity {{and the result of}} damage to the skin. Osmotic forces arc present in the model. To assess the influence of osmotic forces on the water uptake of the skin, we investigated transient TEWL values after 1 h application of salt solutions of different <b>molarities</b> (0, 1, and 4 M NaCl). Methods: Filters saturated with 0, 1, and 4 M NaCl solution were applied for 1 h under occlusion. TEWL was measured 50 – 90 min after removal of the solution. The transient water loss curves were fit with an exponential function. The area under the fitted curve was calculated and regarded as a measure for the amount of extra water absorbed in the skin. Results: For all <b>molarities,</b> TEWL is increased immediately after removal of the solution. In time, this increase decays until pre-application values are reached again. The rate of decrease differs significantly for all three <b>molarities.</b> Ninety-five per cent of the increase has been reversed after 30, 19, and 6 min for the 0, 1, and 4 M case, respectively. The amount of water absorbed differs significantly between the three <b>molarities</b> 7. 3 ± 2. 0; 3. 9 ± 1. 0; 2. 0 ± 0. 5 g/m 2, respectively. Conclusions: In all cases, there was an increase in TEWL immediately after removal of the solution. The significant differences in decay time and amount of water absorbed between the three <b>molarities</b> indicate that osmotic forces do {{play an important role in}} the water uptake...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that the chemical probe 4 -hexadecyl- 2, 6 -dimethylbenzenediazonium ion (16 -ArN 2 +) reacts competitively with interfacial water, with the amide carbonyl followed by cleavage of the headgroups from the tail at the amide oxygen, and with the terminal carboxylate groups in micelles of two N-acyl amino-acid amphiphiles, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate (SLS) and sodium N-lauroylglycinate (SLG), simple peptide bond model amphiphiles. Interfacial <b>molarities</b> (in moles per liter of interfacial volume) of these three groups were obtained from product yields, assuming that selectivity toward a particular nucleophile compared to water is the same in an aqueous reference solution and in the interfacial region. Interfacial carboxylate group <b>molarities</b> are similar to 1. 5 M in both SLS and SLG micelles, but the concentration of the amide carbonyl for SLS micelles is similar to 4. 6 - 5 times less (ca. 0. 7 M) than that of SLG micelles (similar to 3 M). The proton on the secondary N of SLG helps solubilize the amide bond in the aqueous region, but the methyl on the tertiary N of SLS helps solubilize the amide bond in the micellar core, reducing its reaction with 16 -ArN 2 +.
