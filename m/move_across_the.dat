5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|In {{transportation}} planning, {{the different}} sources and destinations of foot and vehicle traffic that meet and interact at {{a traffic light}} can be modeled mathematically as the vertices of a graph, with edges connecting different source-destination pairs.

5|$|The first {{scientist}} to extrapolate the current {{motions of the}} continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean to collide with Asia.|$|E
5|$|The mid-level African easterly jet {{occurs during}} the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above West Africa, and the nocturnal poleward {{low-level}} jet {{occurs in the}} Great Plains of east and South Africa. The low-level easterly African jet stream is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in the southwest monsoon of Africa, and helps form the tropical waves which <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season. The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Kim moved into Cambodia and then across {{the rest of}} Indochina while producing {{a large amount of}} convection. Under the anticipation of regeneration in the Andaman Sea, a TCFA was again issued by the JTWC during the afternoon hours on October18. Early the next day, the JTWC classified Kim as a tropical depression. Initially, the regenerated depression was expected to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> southern tip of Burma and intensify further in the Bay of Bengal. Even though Kim moved across southern Burma as expected, it never moved into the Bay of Bengal. Instead, it drifted northwards along the coast of Burma, parallel to the Arakan Mountain Range and gradually weakened. The JTWC issued their last warning on Kim at 18:00UTC on October20 while located over the Arakan Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Their next {{task was}} {{the capture of}} the road bridge {{spanning}} the Aller river {{as part of the}} 11th Armoured Division's advance on the town of Essel. The 1st Commando Brigade carried out a preliminary <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river over a railway bridge some distance away from their objective and after forcing their way across, they removed the explosives that had been placed on the bridge and dug in on the other side. Over the course of about three-and-a-half hours they repelled a number of determined counterattacks, before No. 6 Commando, supported by Vickers machine guns fixed bayonets and charged the German marines that were defending the bridge, and inflicting heavy casualties upon them.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Laura was {{the final}} storm in the active 1971 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season. It formed on November12 in the western Caribbean Sea, and reached winds of 70mph (120km/h) as it approached western Cuba. Across the island, Laura produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 32.5inches (83cm). The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage. 26,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes. Initially, Laura was forecast to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island and impact the southern United States, but it executed a small loop {{and turned to the}} southwest. The storm moved ashore on Belize, one of only four November storms to affect the country. Little impact occurred during Laura's final landfall, and it dissipated on November22 over central Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fernanda in 1993 was {{the first}} {{significant}} hurricane threat to Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki struck in September 1992. The seventh named storm and fourth major hurricane of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season, Fernanda developed on August 9 {{off the coast of}} Mexico from a tropical wave. Throughout its life, it was a large system, and the hurricane reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h). After weakening slightly, Fernanda restrengthened and was expected to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands. Instead, the hurricane slowed its forward motion and turned away from the state, although it still produced high waves along the eastern shore of the islands. Several homes were damaged, and the surf damaged coastal roads. The storm also contributed to rainfall across the state, and minor flooding occurred in Kauai. Fernanda became extratropical on August 19, and after turning to the northeast became absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

5|$|Second, Frederick's {{most egregious}} mistake was {{his refusal to}} {{consider}} the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, {{they did not have}} enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.|$|E
5|$|The Division {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Hüningen near Basel, Switzerland, and marched in two columns eastward. The right column, {{commanded}} by Jean Victor Tharreau, moved {{along the northern}} shoreline of the Rhine. The left column, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jacopin, moved at the northern-most rim of the river valley. From Switzerland, Masséna sent a Demi-brigade of the Army of Helvetia to secure Schaffhausen, part of the Swiss cantons that lie north of the Rhine river. In holding Schaffhausen, Masséna insured the passage of Ferino's forward units. Ferino's orders were to proceed from Schaffhausen along {{the north shore of}} Lake Constance, also called the Bodensee. His left flank was to remain in contact with the II. Division, to prevent the Austrians from piercing the army's forward line. His advance units were to proceed as far as the Imperial Abbey of Salem. From there, he was instructed to prevent any Austrian reinforcements from Switzerland joining with Archduke Charles, whom Jourdan expected to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Iller river near Augsburg, and advance into Swabia.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a <b>move</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications of taking a defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the Donbass, rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E
