5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of less than six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through {{the first six months}} is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
