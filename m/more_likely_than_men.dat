5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen {{times more likely to}} develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E

Herek, a {{psychology}} professor at the University of California at Davis, concluded: “The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual <b>men</b> are any <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But {{there is no scientific}} basis for asserting that they are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> to do so... Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.” ...|$|R

These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. Feelings of depression and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. Women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|While {{women in}} the United States tend to live longer than men, they {{generally}} are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare. Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, {{which can lead to}} higher rates of depression and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health. Women are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to suffer from sexual or intimate-partner violence both in the United States and worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Cannibalism {{has also}} been implicated as a {{transmission}} mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea.

40|$|Studies report gender {{differences}} in medical service utilization among persons with HIV, although most compare women to heterogeneous groups of men. Competing needs for medical care of women may contribute to those differences. We examined prospectively the role that competing social, economic and health needs, such as caring for others, play in {{gender differences}} in hospital, ambulatory and emergency room (ER) visits. We considered sexual identity to study women, gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men {{in the most recent}} wave (n = 1, 385) of the HCSUS, a nationally representative sample of persons with HIV/AIDS in care in the United States. We considered gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men separately because their different resources and social networks may lead to disparate service utilization. Multivariate regression showed that women were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> gay/bisexual <b>men</b> to be hospitalized, while women and gay/bisexual <b>men</b> were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> to use the ER without subsequent hospitalization. Controlling for competing needs eliminated neither difference but predicted hospitalization and ER use. Findings suggest that addressing competing needs could reduce unnecessary hospitalization and ER use for both genders. Furthermore, examinations of {{gender differences in}} service use should include sexual identity...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the gender}} gap has varied over many years, {{women of all ages}} are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to {{identify}} as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E
25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have {{children under the age}} of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|Women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to {{experience}} sexual harassment, {{especially for those}} working in traditionally masculine occupations. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being. Another study found that level of harassment at workplaces lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of harassment {{were related to the}} worst outcomes, and no harassment was related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women who had experienced a higher level of harassment were more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.|$|E
5000|$|XXY {{males are}} also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> other <b>men</b> to have certain health {{problems}} that typically affect females, such as autoimmune disorders, breast cancer, venous thromboembolic disease, and osteoporosis. [...] In contrast to these potentially increased risks, {{it is currently}} thought that rare X-linked recessive conditions occur less frequently in XXY males than in normal XY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically only carriers rather than affected by these X-linked recessive conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether exposure to life stress can help explain gender differences in the use of social support. Findings from a longitudinal study suggest that as the number of stressful life events increase, elderly men and women are equally <b>likely</b> to become <b>more</b> involved in their social network, while gender differences emerge only in response to chronic financial strain. Further analysis indicates that elderly women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> elderly <b>men</b> to report that the support they received increased their feelings of personal control...|$|R

25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer health {{outcomes}} than men for several reasons ranging from sustaining greater risk to diseases to experiencing higher mortality rates. In the Population Studies Center Research Report by Rachel Snow that compares the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of both male and females, the global DALYs lost to females for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are more than ten times greater {{than those of the}} males. Moreover, the female DALYs to male DALYs ratio for malnutrition-related diseases such as Iron-Deficiency Anemia are often close to 1.5, suggesting that poor nutrition impacts women at a much higher level than men. Additionally, in terms of mental illnesses, women are also two to three times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to be diagnosed with depression. With regards to suicidal rates, up to 80% of those who committed suicide or attempted suicide in Iran are women.|$|E
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic worship {{practiced by}} one Muslim {{may differ from}} another's in minor details, which can affect the precise actions and words involved. Differences arise because of {{different}} interpretations of the Islamic legal sources by the different schools of law (madhhabs) in Sunni Islam, and by different legal traditions within Shia Islam. In the case of ritual worship these differences are generally minor, and should rarely cause dispute. Muslims believe that Muhammad practiced, taught, and disseminated the worship ritual in the whole community of Muslims and made it part of their life. The practice has, therefore, been concurrently and perpetually practiced by the community {{in each of the}} generations. The authority for the basic forms of the Salah is neither the hadiths nor the Qur'an, but rather the consensus of Muslims. Differences also occur due to optional (recommended rather than obligatory) articles of prayer procedure, for example, which verses of the Quran to recite. A 2015 Pew Research Center study found that women are two percent <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to pray on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is a common}} virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have {{at some time in}} their lives. It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or anal cancer. MSM and men with compromised immune systems are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> other <b>men</b> to develop anal cancer. Men with HIV are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to get severe cases of genital warts that are hard to treat.|$|R
40|$|Providing old-age social {{protection}} {{for women is}} a major policy challenge, as women’s working lives {{tend to be more}} diverse than men’s, often including periods of care-giving and part-time work. In addition, workers in the informal sector, where the majority of women work, are excluded from mainstream contributory pension systems designed for formal workers. Although social pensions can contribute significantly to lifting many women in low-income countries out of poverty, protection systems need to consider much more the diversity in women’s life courses and working lives.

25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E
25|$|Problem {{benzodiazepine}} use can {{be associated}} with various deviant behaviors, including drug-related crime. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or methamphetamines in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users {{were also more likely to}} be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit temazepam, with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of dependence, the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with opiates and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} black adult males' knowledge and perceptions of prostate cancer by using the Health Belief Model. The subjects were obtained by randomly approaching males in churches, housing projects, inner-city health clinics, and inner-city shopping centers in seven major Ohio cities. A total of 290 black males responded to the survey (58 % usable response rate). The mean age of respondents was 60 years (standard deviation = 13. 8). Subjects often did not identify trouble urinating, pain urinating, or blood in the urine as possible signs of prostate cancer. Less than half of the subjects knew at what age one should start to have prostate examinations. Forty percent did not believe they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> most <b>men</b> to develop prostate cancer. Almost 60 % did not know black <b>men</b> were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> white <b>men</b> to develop prostate cancer, whereas 45 % thought that if they had prostate cancer it would kill them, and another 28 % were not certain. The vast majority of respondents did not perceive any barriers to having their prostate checked, yet 19 % identified cost of the examination as a potential barrier. Approximately 10 % to 20 % of the respondents were unsure of or did not agree with the benefits of a prostate examination. Analysis of the effects of age, education level, and income levels on the Health Belief Model variables found level of education had the most significant effect followed by level of income...|$|R
