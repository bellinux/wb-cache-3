500|$|While {{the meaning}} of <b>mechanical</b> filter {{in this article is}} one that is used in an {{electromechanical}} role, it is possible to use a <b>mechanical</b> design to filter <b>mechanical</b> vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially <b>mechanical)</b> directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with <b>mechanical</b> components. [...] In the electrical application, in addition to <b>mechanical</b> components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the <b>mechanical</b> and electrical domains.

Unlike any other Giulia derivative, it was upgraded and continued to sell through four decades, into the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|A Midsummer Night's Dream is {{a comedy}} written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events {{surrounding}} the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, the former queen of the Amazons. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers {{and a group of}} six amateur actors (the <b>mechanicals)</b> who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set.

25|$|In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke {{also wrote}} on this play. Kehler notes {{he was the}} husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class <b>mechanicals</b> of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their {{collective}} richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with {{the representatives of the}} fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.|$|E

It used the platform chassis of the original Renault 4CV. The A106 achieved a number of successes through the 1950s and was joined by a low and stylish cabriolet.

Neumeier devotes the three sharply differing musical styles to the three character groups, with the aristocrats and nobles dancing to Mendelssohn, the fairies to Ligeti, and the rustics or <b>mechanicals</b> to the barrel organ.|$|E
