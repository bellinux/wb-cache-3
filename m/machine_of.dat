5|$|A similar {{depiction}} of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West's novel The Day of the Locust (1939), which many critics see {{as an important}} precursor to Barton Fink. Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating movie sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> the movie studio.|$|E
5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans {{and there were}} no more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> Parker's invention.

5|$|In mid-1932, Himmler {{appointed}} Heydrich {{chief of}} the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> terror and intimidation. With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.|$|E

40|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>of</b> {{hollow core}} {{honeycomb}} sandwich materials is a challenging {{job as the}} mechanical properties of various layers (skin, core) are quite dissimilar, and the conventional solid cutting tool experiences a sudden change <b>of</b> conditions while <b>machining</b> {{that might lead to}} damage on the tool/part. Although, abrasive waterjets (AWJs) is highly efficient in the <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> advanced composite materials due to their unique characteristics, efficient <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> sandwich structures by AWJs needs many challenges to be addressed. This work presents various issues observed in AWJ <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> carbon- and glass- fiber skin based, aluminum sandwich structure composite materials, and the limitations of AWJs in processing these exotic materials. Finally, possible strategies for efficient <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> honeycomb structures were proposed for future investigation. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} from the theory of metal cutting that an {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> chips provides the cheapest and {{the most effective way}} <b>of</b> understanding the <b>machining</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a material. The review <b>of</b> literature on <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> DRACs reveals that these aspects have been given relatively little attention during the machining studies. This viewpoint has provided motivation for the study of fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> composites involving chip Formation mechanism experimentally and analytically. This paper discusses experimental work and finite element analysis to investigate the mechanism of chip formation during <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> DRACs. Focus of this paper is on understanding the influence of different cutting parameters on mechanism <b>of</b> <b>machining.</b> Chips generated experimentally and by finite element modeling during orthogonal <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> DRACs were used for this purpose.

5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, {{with the field}} being split into two groups. In {{the first group of}} twelve runners, Wilson topped the session, 0.46 seconds ahead of the HVM Racing <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro—one of four female drivers in the race—with Alex Tagliani in third position. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Power, Takuma Sato and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Hunter-Reay topping his second session of the day. Hélio Castroneves, Briscoe, Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power recorded the fastest lap time, holding off the British pair Wilson and Franchitti. Hunter-Reay, Kanaan and Tagliani finished between fourth and sixth, and would be {{the other half of the}} drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Franchitti saved his best lap of qualifying to the last possible moment, taking his thirteenth career IndyCar Series pole position, and his 24th in American open-wheel racing. Tagliani took second on the grid, on his début with the FAZZT Race Team. Wilson took third ahead of Hunter-Reay, Power and Kanaan.|$|E
