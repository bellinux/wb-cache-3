25|$|In {{order to}} load a gas as {{a sample of}} {{pressure}} transmitting medium, the gas must be in a dense state, as to not shrink the sample chamber once pressure is induced. To achieve a dense state, gases can be liquefied at low temperatures or compressed. Cryogenic loading is a technique that uses liquefied gas {{as a means of}} filling the sample chamber. The DAC is directly immersed into the cryogenic fluid that fills the sample chamber. However, there are disadvantages to cryogenic loading. With the low temperatures indicative of cryogenic loading, the sample is subjected to temperatures that could irreversibly change it. Also, the boiling liquid could displace the sample or trap an air bubble in the chamber. It is not possible to load gas mixtures using the cryogenic method due to the different boiling points of most gases. Gas compression technique densifys the gases at room temperature. With this method, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> seen with cryogenic loading are fixed. Also, loading gas mixtures becomes a possibility. The technique uses a vessel or chamber in which the DAC is placed and is filled with gas. Gases are pressurized and pumped into the vessel with a compressor. Once the vessel is filled and the desired pressure is reached the DAC is closed with a clamp system run by motor driven screws.|$|E

In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> {{time-dependent}} <b>problems</b> {{of planning}} under uncertainty, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem’s</b> complexity comes from <b>the</b> concurrent interaction <b>of</b> simultaneous processes. Generalized Semi-Markov Decision Processes represent an efficient formalism to capture both concurrency {{of events and}} actions and uncertainty. We introduce GSMDP with ob-servable time and hybrid state space and present an new algorithm based on Approximate Policy Iteration to generate efficient policies. This al-gorithm relies on simulation-based exploration and makes use of SVM regression. We experimentally illustrate {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this algorithm and propose an improved version based on the weaknesses highlighted by the experiments. ...|$|R
