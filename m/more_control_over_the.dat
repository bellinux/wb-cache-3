5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E
5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can take a long time, but it gives the user <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E
5|$|Specific design {{elements}} of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former FCS manned ground vehicles program where contractors had <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> design. The GCV was to be networked and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and power management functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested contractors to be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be built around a common chassis.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> musical direction {{as well as the}} album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E
5|$|Rainbow is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It {{was released on}} November 2, 1999, by Columbia Records. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous album, Butterfly (1997), in which she began her transition into the urban market. Rainbow contains a mix of hip hop-influenced R jams, {{as well as a}} variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey had <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several artists such as Jay-Z, Usher, and Snoop Dogg, as well as Missy Elliott, Joe, Da Brat, Master P, Eve, Lil' Kim, 98Â°, Phil Collins and Mystikal.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing Music Box (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, {{as well as her}} husband and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed to achieve the same success matched by her debut album. Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E
5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E

25|$|Plate {{bindings}} {{are used}} with hardboots on Alpine or racing snowboards. Extreme carvers and some Boarder Cross racers also use plate bindings. The stiff bindings and boots give much <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> board {{and allow the}} board to be carved much more easily than with softer bindings. Alpine snowboards tend to be longer and thinner with a much stiffer flex for greater edge hold and better carving performance.|$|E
25|$|All the {{structural}} genes of an operon are turned ON or OFF together, {{due to a}} single promoter and operator upstream to them, but sometimes <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> gene expression is needed. To achieve this aspect, some bacterial genes are located near together, {{but there is a}} specific promoter for each of them; this is called gene clustering. Usually these genes encode proteins which will work together in the same pathway, such as a metabolic pathway. Gene clustering helps a prokaryotic cell to produce metabolic enzymes in a correct order.|$|E
25|$|The Mode 2 Acheulean {{toolmakers}} {{also used}} the Mode 1 flake tool method but supplemented it by using bone, antler, or wood to shape stone tools.
