Khan <b>migrated</b> <b>from</b> Delhi to Hyderabad Deccan where he met and married Raj Kunwar.

50|$|Some {{species of}} {{pratincole}} are long-distance migrants. Shorter migrations include {{those of the}} Madagascan pratincole, which <b>migrates</b> <b>from</b> its breeding grounds in Madagascar to East Africa; in contrast the black-winged pratincole <b>migrates</b> <b>from</b> the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to West and Southern Africa. The migration, which can measure 10,000 km in distance, is often undertaken as a single non-stop flight and is flown at high altitude. The coursers are not particularly migratory, although the cream-coloured courser does <b>migrate</b> <b>from</b> the northern extremes of its range in the winter. The coursers are fairly nomadic, but do not undertake long distance migrations.|$|R
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the families that had <b>migrated</b> <b>from</b> France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others refer to them as ancient Christians who <b>migrated</b> <b>from</b> France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a licentiate at Salamanca, but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings. As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to Rome where he observed the Festival of Flutes.|$|E

The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons <b>migrated</b> <b>from</b> northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her allies.

5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people <b>migrated</b> <b>from</b> rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
