30|$|The {{results show}} that plant growth regulators, antibiotics, {{and the number of}} {{subculture}} generations influence somaclonal variations in torenia. The somaclonal variations in torenia <b>may</b> <b>results</b> from epigenetic changes.|$|R
50|$|Dihydroartemisinin {{has a low}} {{solubility}} in water of less than 0.1 g/L. Consequently, its use <b>may</b> <b>results</b> in side effects caused by minor, yet much more soluble, additives (excipients) such as Cremophor EL.|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|Caution {{should be}} {{observed}} when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in hypertensive crisis.|$|E
5|$|Hypercementosis is {{excessive}} {{formation of}} cementum, which <b>may</b> <b>result</b> from trauma, inflammation, acromegaly, rheumatic fever, and Paget's disease of bone.|$|E
50|$|Flooding between March and <b>May</b> <b>resulted</b> in Baton Rouge {{reaching}} its second highest recorded crest at 45.18 ft on April 29. The Bonnet Carre Spillway was opened {{for the second}} time for 57 days.|$|R
50|$|Restated, {{increases}} in {{central bank money}} <b>may</b> not <b>result</b> in commercial bank money because the money {{is not required to}} be lent out - it <b>may</b> instead <b>result</b> in a growth of unlent reserves (excess reserves).|$|R
25|$|Laker {{retired in}} 1959. The publication, in 1960, of his ghost-written autobiography, {{containing}} severe {{criticism of his}} Surrey and England captain Peter <b>May,</b> <b>resulted</b> in his losing honorary memberships of MCC and Surrey. These were both eventually restored.|$|R
5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia <b>may</b> <b>result</b> from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|If bulb {{extracts}} {{come into}} contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms <b>may</b> <b>result.</b> The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from N. bulbocodium.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation {{resulting}} from infection may impair {{the function of}} any of the cranial nerves. Inflammation of the facial nerve (VII) <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in Bell's palsy.|$|E

50|$|Most major European leagues {{commence}} in {{the second}} half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. <b>May),</b> <b>resulting</b> in a close season window in the Summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.|$|R
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) {{taken with}} {{amphetamine}} <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in a hypertensive crisis if taken {{within two weeks}} after last use of an MAOI type drug.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin <b>may</b> <b>result.</b> Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{droplets}} {{can be highly}} electrically charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning. Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} speed is important factor to consider design. Critical speed is {{the speed of}} rotation at which the frequency of rotation matches the natural frequency. At this speed, any vibration caused by slight unbalance in the rotor is strongly reinforced, which <b>may</b> <b>results</b> high stresses or even failure of equipment.|$|R
50|$|A {{guilty plea}} <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> {{in a lower}} fine.|$|R

5|$|When {{used in the}} {{production}} or handling of chlorine, titanium should not be exposed to dry chlorine gas because it <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in a titanium–chlorine fire. Even wet chlorine presents a fire hazard when extreme weather conditions cause unexpected drying.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it <b>may</b> <b>result</b> from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
50|$|Retinoblastoma <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> in {{abnormal}} light reflection {{from the}} eye.|$|R
50|$|Elections {{normally}} {{take place}} every four years. The Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013 {{took place on}} 2 <b>May</b> 2013, with <b>results</b> shown below. The previous election was on 1 May 2008. There were due to be elections on 3 May 2012, but these were postponed for one year by the Welsh Local Government minister, Carl Sargeant. The Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2017 on 4 <b>May</b> <b>resulted</b> in a no overall majority position with Plaid Cymru holding 14 of the 30 seats.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer <b>may</b> <b>result</b> in a {{shedding}} {{of the outer}} layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer {{is located on the}} lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
