40|$|Legislation, both internationally and nationally, on archaeological {{heritage}} management is {{often based on}} a dominant heritage discourse which focuses on material conservation. However, there are <b>multiple</b> <b>heritage</b> discourses and among them those of indigenous peoples. These are based on different perspectives on issues like history, time and landscape and those differences can have major ramifications for views on appropriate management of archaeological sites. As indigenous peoples’ rights are more often being recognised, also within the archaeological discipline, local indigenous communities become involved in heritage management projects. This involvement entails different degrees, from mere presentation to true collaboration and engagement with the indigenous culture. In Bolivia, there have been significant political developments {{in the last two}} decades related to indigenous peoples. The question is whether increased rights for indigenous peoples result in challenging the dominant heritage discourse during {{archaeological heritage}} management projects. By examining three case studies, it is shown that the level of involvement is not primarily defined by legislation. Bolivian legislation contradicts itself on several points and the enforcement of the law is questioned. Additionally, various other elements have an influence on the level of involvement, such as the personal background of the initiators of the project and the interest the local indigenous community has in the site. Also, the participants of the project have to be motivated to collaborate and have to be open to new perspectives and ideas that might contradict their own...|$|E

Group work, undertaken between November 2005 and December 2006, was evaluated by a before/after design with 43 children aged from 8 to 15 attending five different groups (response rate 77 %), using three well-established and validated measures. There were improvements on the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale from 31. 4 to 33. 0 (P = 0. 005) with more improvement among younger children and boys (P = 0. 004 and P = 0. 001); and well-being {{as measured by the}} GHQ 12 improved from 1. 5 to 0. 8 (P = 0. 111) with more improvement among older children (P = 0. 026). On the third measure of problem behaviour (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), there was an improvement from 12. 4 to 12. 1 (P = 0. 716), but there was no improvement at all for girls. Mentoring was evaluated by telephone interviews between June and October 2006 with 14 mothers whose children had just completed, or were nearing completion of, mentoring (response rate 70 %). Overall, the mothers' evaluations were highly positive: two-thirds commended the service on the positive impact on their children's well-being and happiness (including all the mothers of daughters); a half reported positive impacts on identity; mothers commended the positive role model effect same-sex mentors had on their children's behaviour; but only a third said mentoring had boosted their children's self-esteem...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{propose that the}} texts of Guatemalan author Miguel Angel Asturias and the North American Native author Leslie Marmon Silko can be {{compared}} and interpreted {{from the perspective of}} spirituality. I approach both mixed-blood authors as mediating a spiritually-centred contemporary identity. They revalue and update the spiritual teachings in the myths of their Meso-American-Anasazi ancestral heritages. A cross-cultural reading of mythical quests, indigenous sacred texts, Western mysticism, and the universal heroic paradigm discloses a universal recognition of the need to maintain order and balance between spirituality and materiality. An examination of contemporary Native and Latin American literary studies demonstrates that the dominant Western perspective creates a static view of indigenous people and a materialistic lifestyle which alienates individuals from the spirituality of their ancestors. I conclude that Asturias' and Silko's mediation of their <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> provides a necessary re-valuing of Western and indigenous epistemologies. The mythical and sacred sources restore balance and unity in the individual and create a viable basis for contemporary mixed-blood and mixed-heritage identity.

5000|$|Ambilingualism: {{a region}} is called ambilingual if this {{functional}} distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area {{it is nearly}} impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> like Luxembourg, which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or Malaysia and Singapore, which fuses the cultures of Malays, China, and India or communities with high rates of deafness like Martha's Vineyard where historically most inhabitants spoke both MVSL and English or in southern Israel where locals speak both ABSL and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a clearly dominant state language (be it de jure or de facto) and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.|$|R

40|$|In her {{compelling}} case for liberal education, Martha Nussbaum emphasizes {{the nuances of}} the examined life and in particular how essential the narrative imagination is to “cultivating humanity” (9 – 11). While Nussbaum is advocating for liberal education in general terms, her call is particularly suited to the mission of honors education and its mandate for “broader, deeper, and more complex” learning experiences (NCHC Board of Directors). Nussbaum’s conceptual scheme encourages education in support of openness, intensity, and breadth, in particular urging approaches that require an ability to acknowledge and reconsider one’s own culture, traditions, and ways of thinking. At times, this task seems particularly challenging in the early adulthood of a traditional undergraduate. Most students—like most human beings— struggle with how to enact the educational processes of critical thinking and critical examination, even {{in the case of}} honors, which tends, as a cohort, to be particularly rich in students who think in questioning ways and which often includes a greater proportion of students and colleagues who have <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> and broad ranges of experience. These composite heritages create for the student a situation that is “peculiar rather than privileged” and, potentially, a special role “to act as bridges, go-betweens, mediators, between the various communities and cultures” (Maalouf 5). Honors is thus a particularly opportune educational site to cultivate the thinking and critical examination fundamental to this special role...|$|R
40|$|The Salt Companion to Carter Revard is a {{groundbreaking}} collection of critical {{essays on the}} poetry and scholarship of one of Native America’s most loved and respected poets. Carter Revard, Osage poet, Rhodes scholar, and professor of medieval English literature, grew up among Osage and Ponca relations on the Osage Reservation in Oklahoma. His complex, elegantly crafted poetry ranges from lyrical evocations of his rural childhood and traditional lifeways to reflections on academic life in Oxford and St. Louis, global politics, and postmodern science; from narrative poems about family bootleggers and AIM activists, tornados and rainbows, to adaptations of Anglo-Saxon riddle poems. In precise and gorgeous language, Revard weaves the varied songs of his <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> and experiences into a symphony of celebration of the large and small miracles of the universe. Revard’s blending of Western literary and Native oral traditions demand multilayered critical approaches. The thirteen critical essays gathered in this volume, written by leading scholars of Native American literature, explore Revard’s poetry from multiple perspectives, offering biographical and cultural contexts, thematic considerations, and close readings of individual poems. Two essays break exciting new ground by examining interrelationships between Revard’s medieval scholarship and American Indian storytelling traditions. Like Revard’s poems and scholarship, the essays are both erudite and warmly personal, filled with good stories that will appeal to scholars, students, and general readers alike...|$|R

With contributions from scores of established and newer scholars from six continents, the volume covers a diverse range of geopolitical and social territories across the world. Drawing on the <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> that underpin research on education and learning in adulthood, this Handbook addresses the inner tensions between adult education, adult learning, lifelong education, and lifelong learning, by using current research and theorizations from disciplinary backgrounds, including philosophy, psychology, biology and neuroscience, anthropology, sociology, history, political science, and economics. It {{provides a}}n explicit discussion of the differences and tensions between adult and lifelong education and learning, and locates these in different policy and historical contexts, theories and practices. It explores a variety of discipline-based theoretical perspectives, and highlights how these have influenced, and been influenced by, research in the education and learning of adults. The Handbook also explores the inevitable frictions and dilemmas these present, and carefully examines {{the role of the}} international dimension in researching education and learning in formal, non-formal and informal contexts, beyond traditional schooling. This state-of-the-art, comprehensive Handbook is {{the first of its kind}} to explore adult education, lifelong education and lifelong learning fully as distinct activities on an international scale.

40|$|Multiracial {{children}} constitute one of {{the fastest}} growing racial groups in the United States. However, biracial children, in particular Black-White biracial children, often are not recognized in the educational system. For instance, the current classification of Black-White biracial students in the state and federal educational systems is not disaggregated and does not allow for analyses of educational outcomes for this population. Not only is this population invisible in state education data, the demographic data at the school level often fail to represent this population. Not acknowledging <b>multiple</b> <b>heritages</b> dismisses the identity and experiences of students who are multiracial and thus symbolically negates a part of who they are. Additionally, multiracial students may be classified in a single category by administrators for the purposes of schools and funding. This study offers the perspective of administrators and current state and federal policies on this issue as applied to Black-White self-identified children and describes the complexities and relevance of addressing multiracial policies in educational systems. An ecological theoretical framework is used to explore four research questions in this area. Data were collected from seven school district administrators across Oregon through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Relationships in the data between responses and procedures from the seven sampled school districts are examined. Results suggest that across the seven school districts in this study, implementation of the policies and procedures of racial and ethnic categorization varied substantially. Furthermore, even though this revised race and ethnicity reporting policy was in part created to more accurately represent the multiracial population, it may actually be obscuring the multiple identities of these students. Detailed policy implications are discussed in further details in the Conclusions chapter...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses how residents, governments, and {{the international}} community continue to transform and recast two colonial port cities, Elmina in Ghana and Fort Kochi in India, as heritage sites and museums in order to represent particular histories. These sites act as repositories of memory, venues for community rituals, spaces for exhibitions, and backdrops for artistic productions. This exploration of these ports demonstrates the continued relevance and resonance of colonial heritage in postcolonies and exposes how knowledge of colonialism are produced and disseminated through the media of heritage and museums. Elmina and Fort Kochi are ideal case studies in part because of their similar historical trajectories, but principally because of their parallel contemporary existences. Both of these towns have been reconstituted as heritage destinations and are now exhibitionary landscapes with <b>multiple</b> museums, <b>heritage</b> homes, and archeological ruins. Furthermore, both are venues for recurring cultural performances and festivals. Their urban landscapes simultaneously exhibit colonial struggles, modern aspirations, and postcolonial predicaments. By analyzing the revitalization of history in Elmina and Fort Kochi, I show how these cities function as alternative archives that harbor submerged narratives of migration and cultural exchange through unique modes of museum display, both within and beyond the walls of the gallery spaces...|$|R
