5|$|The menu at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed the menu. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included <b>matzo</b> ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E
25|$|Popular Ashkenazi {{dishes are}} <b>matzo</b> brei (crumbled <b>matzo</b> with grated onion, fried with {{scrambled}} egg), <b>matzo</b> latkes (pancakes) and chremslach (also called crimsel or gresjelies; <b>matzo</b> meal fritters). Wined <b>matzo</b> kugels (pudding) {{have been introduced}} into modern Jewish cooking. For thickening soups and sauces at Passover fine <b>matzo</b> meal or potato flour is used instead of flour: for frying fish or cutlets, a coating of <b>matzo</b> meal and egg, and for stuffing, potatoes instead of soaked bread.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} before Passover, matzos are {{prepared}} for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups ("chaburas") to bake handmade <b>matzo</b> for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round <b>matzo.</b> Chaburas also work together in machine-made <b>matzo</b> factories, which produce the typically square-shaped <b>matzo</b> sold in stores.|$|E
50|$|Komemiyus has {{a famous}} Matzah factory that starts baking <b>matzos</b> 9 {{months in advance}} of pesach and {{produces}} huge amounts of 18 minute <b>matzos.</b> The factory mainly hires women from surrounding kibbutzim. Each batch takes around 12 minutes {{from the time the}} flour touches the water until it is completely baked.|$|R
25|$|Some machine-made <b>matzos</b> are {{completed}} within 5 minutes of being kneaded.|$|R

25|$|A {{symbol of}} the Passover holiday is <b>matzo,</b> an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is {{continually}} worked from mixing through baking, {{so that it is}} not allowed to rise. <b>Matzo</b> may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat <b>matzo,</b> specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, <b>matzo)</b> during the entire week of Passover. Consequently, the eating of <b>matzo</b> figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Horowitz {{is one of}} {{the world}} experts of Passover <b>Matzo</b> (and author of the OU manual on this subject) and kosher food, having {{assisted}} in <b>Matzo</b> and <b>matzo</b> flour production around in Israel, England, Mexico, Argentina and the former USSR.|$|E
25|$|Passover cake recipes {{call for}} potato starch or Passover cake flour made from finely {{granulated}} <b>matzo</b> instead of regular flour, {{and a large}} amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use <b>matzo</b> farfel (broken bits of <b>matzo)</b> or ground nuts as the base. For families with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.|$|E

25|$|Passover foods vary {{distinctly}} between Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities. Ashkenazim exclude rice, {{while it}} is served by Sephardim. <b>Matzo</b> is traditionally prepared from water and flour only, {{but there are other}} varieties, such as egg <b>matzo,</b> which may also contain fruit juice. At the seder, it is customary in some communities, particularly among strictly Orthodox Jews, to use handmade shmura <b>matzo,</b> which has undergone particularly strict kashrut supervision.|$|E
25|$|The {{exclusion}} of leaven {{from the home}} has forced Jewish cooks to be creative, producing {{a wide variety of}} Passover dishes that use <b>matzo</b> meal and potato as thickeners. Potato flour is largely used in cakes along with finely ground <b>matzo</b> meal and nuts.|$|E
25|$|The Torah {{says that}} it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that {{there was no time to}} allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, <b>matzo,</b> is a {{reminder}} of the rapid departure of the Exodus. Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, <b>matzo</b> was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that <b>matzo</b> was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E
5000|$|Rakusen's {{was founded}} by a watch maker, Lloyd Rakusen, who started from baking <b>matzos</b> in his own back room to forming a factory {{in the city of}} Leeds, passing the {{thriving}} company onto his family in 1944 at his death.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a sermon}} {{broadcast}} {{on the official}} Jordanian TV channel on 22 August 2014, Sheik Bassam Ammoush, a former Minister of Administrative Development who was appointed to Jordan's House of Senate ("Majlis al-Aayan") in 2011, stated (as translated by MEMRI): [...] "In Gaza Strip {{we are dealing with}} the enemies of Allah, who believe that the <b>matzos</b> that they bake on their holidays must be kneaded with blood. When the Jews were in the diaspora, they would murder children in England, in Europe, and in America. They would slaughter them and use their blood to make their <b>matzos...</b> They believe that they are God's chosen people. They believe that the killing of any human being is a form of worship and a means to draw near their god." ...|$|R
25|$|The baking of <b>matzo</b> is labor-intensive, as only 18–22 {{minutes is}} {{permitted}} between {{the mixing of}} flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, {{only a small number}} of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the <b>matzo.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the meal}} and {{customary}} desserts, {{the leader of}} the Seder distributes pieces of the afikoman to each guest. If there is not enough to go around, additional pieces of <b>matzo</b> may be added to each person's portion of afikoman.|$|E
25|$|A popular dish among Ashkenazim, as amongst most Eastern-Europeans, is pierogi (which {{are related}} to but {{distinct}} from kreplach), often filled with minced beef. Kishka is a popular Ashkenazi dish traditionally made from beef intestine (casing) stuffed with flour or <b>matzo</b> meal, schmaltz and spices.|$|E
5000|$|We all {{remember}} how the Jews used to slaughter Christians, {{in order to}} mix their blood in their holy <b>matzos.</b> This is not a figment of imagination or something taken from a film. It is a fact, acknowledged by their own books and by historical evidence. It happened everywhere, here and there.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} which aired on Al-Hafez TV on 12 May 2013, Khaled Al-Zaafrani of the Egyptian Justice and Progress Party, stated (as translated by MEMRI): [...] "It's {{well known that}} during the Passover, they Jews make <b>matzos</b> called the [...] "Blood of Zion." [...] They take a Christian child, slit his throat and slaughter him. Then they take his blood and make their <b>matzos.</b> This {{is a very important}} rite for the Jews, which they never forgo... They slice it and fight over who gets to eat Christian blood." [...] In the same interview, Al-Zaafrani stated that [...] "The French kings and the Russian czars discovered this in the Jewish quarters. All the massacring of Jews that occurred in those countries were because they discovered that the Jews had kidnapped and slaughtered children, {{in order to make the}} Passover matzos." ...|$|R
50|$|Each {{of the six}} items {{arranged}} on the plate has special significance to the retelling {{of the story of}} Passover — the exodus from Egypt — which is the focus of this ritual meal. A seventh symbolic item used during the meal — the three <b>matzos</b> — is not considered part of the seder plate proper.|$|R
25|$|After the matzos {{come out}} of the oven, the entire work area is {{scrubbed}} down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now chametz, and can contaminate the next batch of <b>matzo.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the Manischewitz Company {{commissioned}} the AJL {{to produce a}} series of American Jewish History panels which appeared on over one million Passover <b>Matzo</b> boxes.

5000|$|During an {{interview}} which aired on Rotana Khalijiya TV on 13 August 2012, Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh stated (as translated by MEMRI) that [...] "It {{is well known}} that the Jews celebrate several holidays, one of which is the Passover, or the <b>Matzos</b> Holiday. I read once about a doctor who was working in a laboratory. This doctor lived with a Jewish family. One day, they said to him: 'We want blood. Get us some human blood.' He was confused. He didn't know what this was all about. Of course, he couldn't betray his work ethics in such a way, but he began inquiring, and he found that they were making <b>matzos</b> with human blood." [...] Al-Odeh also stated that [...] "Jews eat it, believing that this brings them close to their false god, Yahweh" [...] and that [...] "They would lure a child in order to sacrifice him in the religious rite that they perform during that holiday." ...|$|R
50|$|While in {{the final}} version the three amorous liquors are Marianne Chartreuse, Ladislaw Slivovitz, and Boris Wutki, representatives of France, Poland and Russia, the {{original}} intent {{was to have the}} German Michel Schnapps instead winning Marianne's hand, a symbol of political reconciliation or even resurgent German virility, written out after the Occupation of the Ruhr. Also in earlier sketches, red banners were waved amidst the riotous proletarian cakes, with the Revolution Polka conducted by <b>matzos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ob Saturday afternoon, {{following}} Minha, {{the congregation}} took the communal meal of Seudah Shlishit together, {{in the room}} at right when entering the building from outside. This third meal of the Shabbat took place in total darkness, which gave it a particular cachet. No one {{wanted to see the}} Shabbat depart. Rabbi Rubinstein commented in Yiddish the weekly portion of the Torah. Zemiros (songs) accompanied the meal which consisted in <b>Matzos</b> with oily sardines on top.|$|R
25|$|Each {{participant}} {{receives an}} olive-sized portion of <b>matzo</b> {{to be eaten}} as afikoman. After the consumption of the afikoman, traditionally, no other food may be eaten {{for the rest of}} the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the holiday}} of Sukkot, the {{intermediary}} days of Passover {{are known as}} Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It {{is a time for}} family outings and picnic lunches of <b>matzo,</b> hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.|$|E
25|$|Chametz {{does not}} include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as {{leavening}} agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and <b>matzo</b> meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2016, Abu Qatada {{released}} a video on his Youtube account {{in which he}} stated (as translated by MEMRI), that Blood Libel accusation against Jews is true, stating that [...] "This Jewish blood <b>matzos</b> ... there is a text in the Talmud ... It says that the <b>matzos</b> eaten by the Jews on their holiday must be consecrated {{with the blood of}} a man from among the Gentiles. Usually they take a Christian because they cannot overpower a Muslim. This actually happened, yet they BBC treat it as a mockery." [...] In the same video, Abu Qatada alleged that [...] "The Jews control the world and that is a fact. The Jews run the global economy, that is a fact. Do you want me to give you the numbers? Can any rational person who has read the history of the Bolshevik Revolution deny that it was won due to the support of the Jews, and the Jewish money of the Rothschild family? Can anyone deny that Lenin was Jewish? Can any rational person dare say that there is even one Communist party in the world that was not founded by the Jews?" ...|$|R

By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|R
