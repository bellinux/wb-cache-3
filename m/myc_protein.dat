40|$|Mammalian <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> are {{important}} determinants of cell proliferation {{as well as}} the undifferentiated state of stem cells and their activity is frequently deregulated in cancer. Based mainly on conservation in the C-terminal DNA-binding and dimerization domain, Myc-like proteins have been reported in many simpler organisms within and outside the Metazoa but they have not been found in fungi or plants. Several important signature motifs defining mammalian <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> are found in the N-terminal domain but {{the extent to which these}} are found in the Myc-like proteins from simpler organisms is not well established. The extent of N-terminal signature sequence conservation would give important insights about the evolution of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> and their current function in mammalian physiology and disease. In a systematic study of Myc-like proteins we show that N-terminal signature motifs are not readily detectable in individual Myc-like proteins from invertebrates but that weak similarities to Myc boxes 1 and 2 can be found in the N-termini of the simplest Metazoa {{as well as the}} unicellular choanoflagellate, Monosiga brevicollis, using multiple protein alignments. Phylogenetic support for the connections of these <b>proteins</b> to established <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> is however poor. We show that the pattern of predicted protein disorder along the length of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> can be used as a complementary approach to making dendrograms of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> that aids the classification of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins.</b> This suggests that the pattern of disorder within <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> is more conserved through evolution than their amino acid sequence. In the disorder-based dendrograms the Myc-like proteins from simpler organisms, including M. brevicollis, are connected to established <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> with a higher degree of certainty. Our results suggest that protein disorder based dendrograms may be of general significance for studying distant relationships between proteins, such as transcription factors, that have high levels of intrinsic disorder...|$|R
40|$|<b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> are {{involved}} in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Deregulated expression of myc family genes has been implicated in the genesis of a variety of cancers. <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> share significant sequence homology in the carboxyl terminus with a number of cellular transcription factors. These basic domain-helix-loophelix and leucine zipper motifs {{have been shown to be}} involved in protein dimerization and DNA binding. Indeed, evidence now exists to indicate that the c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc proteins can form a heterodimer with a cellular protein, named MAX, and that the myc-MAX heterodimer can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. In addition, <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> have several amino-terminal regions that are highly conserved between myc family members. These regions of homology are not found in other cellular proteins but are essential for transformation. On the basis of these observations, it would appear likely that <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> function in cell growth by regulating the activity of a number of cellular genes whose products control cell proliferation. Several groups have identified cellular genes that are subject to regulation by <b>myc</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, none of these genes is likely to be directly involved in the control of cell cycle progression. We show here that amino-terminal sequences in the c-myc protein mediate specific binding to the product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRB. We propose a model in which activity of the c-myc protein is modulated through binding to the retinoblastoma gene product...|$|R
50|$|Several known {{regulators}} of transcriptional amplification {{have been}} characterized including the oncogene Myc., the Rett syndrome protein MECP2, and the BET bromodomain protein BRD4.

40|$|<b>Myc</b> <b>{{proteins}}</b> {{are basic}} helix-loop-helix/ leucine-zipper proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences. In vivo, <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have been found}} associated with Max, another basic helix 4 oop-helix/leucine-zipper protein. However, {{it is not known}} to what extent the dimerization of Myc with Max is required for the manifestation of the Mycinduced phenotype. To investigate this, we constructed a dominant-negative mutant of Max, named dMax, that inhibits sequence-specific DNA binding of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins.</b> Using a rat neuroblastoma model system, we show that dMax reverts N-Myc-induced changes in cellular gene expression. A control mutant of dMax that contains a proline residue in the leucinezipper region was unable to bind to N-Myc and did not revert the N-Myc-induced changes in cellular gene expression. These data support the hypothesis that N-Myc affects neuroblastoma gene expression through the formation of a DNA-binding heterodimeric complex with Max in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{established}} that when overexpressed, the <b>MYC</b> family <b>proteins</b> can cause DNA double-stand breaks (DSBs) and genome instability, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. MYC induced genetic instability {{may result from}} increased DNA damage and/or reduced DNA repair. Here we show that when overexpressed, <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> induce a sustained DNA damage response (DDR) and reduce the wave of DSBs repair. We used a cell-based DSBs system whereby, upon induction of an inducible restriction enzyme AsiSI, hundreds of site-specific DSBs are generated across the genome to investigate the role of <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> on DSB. We found that high levels of MYC do not block accumulation of γH 2 AX at AsiSI sites, but delay its clearance, indicating an inefficient repair, while the initial recognition of DNA damage is largely unaffected. Repair of both homologous and nonhomologous repair-prone segments, characterized by high or low levels of recruited RAD 51, respectively, was delayed. Collectively, these data indicate that high levels of <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> delay the resolution of DNA lesions engineered to occur in cell cultures...|$|R
40|$|The bHLH {{transcription}} factor MYC 2, together with its paralogues MYC 3 and MYC 4, {{is a master}} regulator of {{the response to the}} jasmonate (JA) hormone in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In the absence of JA, JASMONATE ZIM (JAZ) proteins interact with the <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> to block their activity. Understanding of the mechanism and specificity of this interaction is key to unravel JA signalling. We generated mutant <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> and assessed their activity and the specificity of their interaction with the 12 Arabidopsis JAZ proteins. We show that the D 94 N mutation present in the atr 2 D allele of MYC 3 abolishes the interaction between MYC 3 and most JAZ proteins. The same effect is observed when the corresponding conserved Asp (D 105) was mutated in MYC 2. Accordingly, MYC 2 (D 105 N) activated target genes in the presence of JAZ proteins, in contrast to wild-type MYC 2. JAZ 1 and JAZ 10 were the only JAZ proteins still showing interaction with the mutant <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins,</b> due to a second MYC interaction domain, besides the classical Jas domain. Our results visualize the divergence among JAZ proteins in their interaction with <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins.</b> Ultimately, the transferability of the Asp-to-Asn amino acid change might facilitate the design of hyperactive {{transcription factor}}s for plant engineering...|$|R

40|$|Primary diffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS DLBCL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of DLBCL, the biology of which is poorly understood.

40|$|Diffuse large B cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. A small {{subset of}} DLBCLs has translocations involving the MYC locus {{and an additional}} group has a molecular signature resembling Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). Presently, identification of such cases by morphology is unreliable and relies on cytogenetic or complex molecular methods such as gene transcriptional profiling. Herein, we describe an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for identifying DLBCLs with increased <b>MYC</b> <b>protein</b> expression. We tested 77 cases of DLBCL and identified 15 cases with high <b>MYC</b> <b>protein</b> expression (nuclear staining in > 50 % of tumor cells). All MYC translocation positive cases had increased <b>MYC</b> <b>protein</b> expression by this IHC assay. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the DLBCL transcriptional profiles revealed that tumors with increased <b>MYC</b> <b>protein</b> expression (regardless of underlying MYC translocation status) had coordinate upregulation of MYC target genes, providing molecular confirmation of the IHC results. We then generated a molecular classifier derived from the MYC IHC results in our cases and employed it to successfully classify mBLs from two previously reported independent case series, providing additional confirmation that the MYC IHC results identify clinically important subsets of DLBCLs. Lastly, we found that DLBCLs with high <b>MYC</b> <b>protein</b> expression had inferior overall survival when treated with R-CHOP. In conclusion, the IHC method described herein {{can be used to}} readily identify the biologically and clinically distinct cases of MYC-driven DLBCL, which represent a clinically significant subset of DLBCL cases due to their inferior overall survival...|$|E
40|$|<b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> are {{a family}} of oncogene-encoded {{transcriptional}} regulators that feature prominently in cancer.

Over 30 years of research into MYC has revealed the importance of chromatin in regulating both the production of <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins</b> and their ability to recognize target genes and to function as modulators of transcription. Here, we review contemporary understanding of the MYC–chromatin connection, focusing on how the encasement of DNA into chromatin impacts expression of MYC genes, and how MYC responds to and modulates chromatin to exert its transcriptional effects.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} degradation of c-myc and N-myc in vitro is mediated by the ubiquitin system. However, {{the role of the}} system in targeting the <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> in vivo and the identity of the conjugating enzymes and possible ancillary proteins involved has remained obscure. Here we report that the degradation of the <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> in cells is inhibited by lactacystin and MG 132, two inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome. Inhibition is accompanied by accumulation of myc-ubiquitin conjugates. Dissection of the ancillary proteins involved revealed that the high-risk human papillomavirus oncoprotein E 6 - 16 stimulates conjugation and subsequent degradation of the <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> in vitro. Expression of E 6 - 16 in cells results in significant shortening of the t 1 / 2 of the <b>myc</b> <b>proteins</b> with subsequent decrease in their cellular level. Analysis of the conjugating enzymes revealed that under basal conditions the proteins can be conjugated by two pairs of E 2 s and E 3 s—E 2 - 14 kDa and E 3 α involved in the “N-end rule” pathway, and E 2 -F 1 (UbcH 7) and E 3 -Fos involved also in conjugation of c-Fos. In the presence of E 6 - 16, a third pair, E 2 -F 1 and E 6 -AP mediate conjugation of myc by means of a mechanism that appears to be similar to that involved in the targeting of p 53, formation of a myc⋅E 6 ⋅E 6 –AP targeting complex. It is possible that in certain cells E 6 -mediated targeting of myc prevents myc-induced apoptosis and thus ensures maintenance of viral infection...|$|R

Recently we identified a new mode of Myc regulation in differentiating muscle cells in which c-Myc protein is proteolytically cleaved by calcium-dependent calpains in the cytoplasm. This cleavage serves two purposes. First, it inactivates the transcriptional function of Myc by removing its C-terminus, a region responsible for the interaction of Myc with Max and DNA. Second, it alters cytoskeletal architecture and accelerates muscle differentiation through the activity of the remaining N-terminal cleavage product (termed Myc-nick). Here we discuss the roles and regulation of full-length Myc and Myc-nick in terminal differentiation and propose a model in which calpain-mediated cleavage of Myc operates as a functional switch...|$|R
40|$|Our {{recent work}} {{has shown that}} {{activation}} of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway extends the half-life of the <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> and thus enhances the accumulation of Myc activity. We have extended these observations by investigating two N-terminal phosphorylation sites in Myc, Thr 58 and Ser 62, which {{are known to be}} regulated by mitogen stimulation. We now show that the phosphorylation of these two residues is critical for determining the stability of Myc. Phosphorylation of Ser 62 is required for Ras-induced stabilization of Myc, likely mediated through the action of ERK. Conversely, phosphorylation of Thr 58, likely mediated by GSK- 3 but dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser 62, is associated with degradation of Myc. Further analysis demonstrates that the Ras-dependent PI- 3 K pathway is also critical for controlling <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation, likely through the control of GSK- 3 activity. These observations thus define a synergistic role for multiple Ras-mediated phosphorylation pathways in the control of <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation during the initial stage of cell proliferation...|$|E

Similar studies have also shown how components of the insulin and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways are key regulators of growth. Despite a few suggestions that Myc transcriptional activity lies downstream of these pathways, a molecular mechanism linking these signaling pathways to Myc has not been clearly described. Using biochemical and genetic approaches we tried to identify novel mechanisms that control Myc activity upon activation of insulin and TOR signaling pathways. Results Our biochemical studies show that insulin induces <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation in Drosophila S 2 cells, which correlates with {{a decrease in the}} activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 -beta (GSK 3 β) a kinase that is responsible for <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> degradation.

Treatment with amino acids that directly activate the TOR pathway results in <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation, which also depends on the ability of S 6 K kinase to inhibit GSK 3 β activity. Myc upregulation by insulin and TOR pathways is a mechanism conserved in cells from the wing imaginal disc, where expression of Dp 110 and Rheb also induces <b>Myc</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation, while inhibition of insulin and TOR pathways result in the opposite effect.

They interact {{with a large number}} of other proteins, such as transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes and kinases. Remarkably few of these interactions have been characterized structurally. This is at least in part due to the intrinsically disordered nature of <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins,</b> which adopt a defined conformation only in the presence of binding partners. Due to this behaviour, crystallographic studies on <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> have been limited to short fragments in complex with other proteins. Most recently, we determined the crystal structure of Aurora-A kinase domain bound to a 28 amino acid fragment of the N-Myc transactivation domain. The structure reveals an a-helical segment within N-Myc capped by two tryptophan residues that recognize the surface of Aurora-A. The kinase domain acts as a molecular scaffold, independently of its catalytic activity, upon which this region of N-Myc becomes ordered. The binding site for N-Myc on Aurora-A is disrupted by certain ATP-competitive inhibitors, such as MLN 8237 (alisertib) and CD 532 and explains how these kinase inhibitors are able to disrupt the protein-protein interaction to effect Myc destabilization. Structural studies on this and other Myc complexes will lead to the design of protein-protein interaction inhibitors as chemical tools to dissect the complex pathways of Myc regulation and function, which may be developed into Myc inhibitors for the treatment of cancer...|$|R

T lymphocytes of NOD mice are resistant to apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids, or by starving or DNA-damaging treatments, a feature that was interpreted as being linked to escape of autoreactive T cells from thymic negative selection. c-myc is one of the gene targets of glucocorticoids (GC), its expression being down-regulated by the activated GC-GC receptor complex. We investigated here whether expression of <b>Myc</b> <b>protein,</b> in response to dexamethasone stimulation, was the same in NOD mice and in non-autoimmune strains, namely NON, BALB/c and C 57 Bl. 6.

Here we report that Myc promotes upregulation of S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), an enzyme which hydrolyzes S-adenosyl homocysteine, thus neutralizing its inhibitory effects, and this is required for c-Myc-induced mRNA cap methylation. c-Myc-induced mRNA cap methylation was repressed by inhibiting the expression or activity of SAHH, whereas the same treatments {{did not have a}} significant effect on c-Myc-induced transcription or other c-Myc-dependent methylation events. The selective inhibition of mRNA cap methylation afforded by SAHH repression revealed that c-Myc-induced cap methylation could be correlated with the core c-Myc functions of protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell transformation. The <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> c-Myc, N-Myc and L-Myc promote cell growth and proliferation and are essential for development (12, 25). Deregulated expression of the <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> results in unrestrained cell proliferation and promotes tumor formation. The c-Myc gene, in particular, is recognized to be a potent oncogene in many organs and tissues and is deregulated in...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} myc proto-oncogenes encodes {{transcription}} factors (c-, N-, and L-Myc) that regulate cell growth and proliferation and {{are involved in}} the etiology of diverse cancers. <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> are thought to function by binding and regulating specific target genes. Here we report that <b>Myc</b> <b>proteins</b> are required for the widespread maintenance of active chromatin. Disruption of N-myc in neuronal progenitors and other cell types leads to nuclear condensation accompanied by large-scale changes in histone modifications associated with chromatin inactivation, including hypoacetylation and altered methylation. These effects are largely reversed by exogenous Myc as well as by differentiation and are mimicked by the Myc antagonist Mad 1. The first chromatin changes are evident within 6 h of Myc loss and lead to changes in chromatin structure. Myc widely influences chromatin in part through upregulation of the histone acetyltransferase GCN 5. This study provides the first evidence for regulation of global chromatin structure by an oncoprotein and may explain the broad effects of Myc on cell behavior and tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The <b>MYC</b> {{family of}} <b>proteins</b> {{is a group}} of basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper {{transcription}} factors that feature prominently in cancer. Overexpression of MYC is observed {{in the vast majority of}} human malignancies and promotes an extraordinary set of changes that impact cell proliferation, growth, metabolism, DNA replication, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, differentiation, and metastasis. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to the mammalian family of <b>MYC</b> <b>proteins,</b> highlight important functional properties that endow them with their potent oncogenic potential, describe their mechanisms of action and of deregulation in cancer cells, and discuss efforts to target the unique properties of MYC, and of MYC-driven tumors, to treat cancer...|$|R
