25|$|A later Theravada text, the Abhidhammattha-sangaha (11th-12th century) says: “The latent dispositions are defilements which ‘lie along with’ the <b>mental</b> <b>process</b> {{to which}} they belong, rising to the surface as obsessions {{whenever}} they meet with suitable conditions” (Abhs 7.9). The Theravada school also holds {{that there is a}} subconscious stream of awareness termed the Bhavanga.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{field of}} behavioral neuroscience focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. For example, physiological psychologists use animal models, typically rats, {{to study the}} neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses. Cognitive neuroscientists investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. The biopsychosocial model is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. It assumes that any given behavior or <b>mental</b> <b>process</b> affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.|$|E

The {{operations of the}} mind are not merely represented by intelligent acts, {{they are the same}} as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing are not merely clues to hidden <b>mental</b> <b>processes</b> or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those <b>mental</b> <b>processes</b> or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions are not merely clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.|$|R

25|$|Jaspers {{thought that}} psychiatrists could {{diagnose}} delusions {{in the same}} way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based {{on the content of}} the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See delusion for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between primary and secondary delusions. He defined primary delusions as autochthonous, meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal <b>mental</b> <b>process.</b> (This is a slightly different use of the word autochthonous than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.|$|E
25|$|Habitus is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a <b>mental</b> <b>process</b> and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Wegner {{has applied}} this {{principle}} to the inferences people make {{about their own}} conscious will. People typically experience a thought {{that is consistent with}} a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference. Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused – and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause. The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will (which he says might be more accurately labelled as 'the emotion of authorship') is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors, but is inferred from various cues through an intricate <b>mental</b> <b>process,</b> authorship processing. Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free will, both psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegner's theories.|$|E

Rather than an instantaneous scan and conversion to digital form, Kurzweil feels humans will most likely experience gradual conversion as portions of their brain are augmented with neural implants, increasing their proportion of non-biological intelligence slowly over time.|$|E
