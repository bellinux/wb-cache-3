25|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and <b>mespirenone</b> (ZK-94679).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mespirenone</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} ZK-94679), {{also known as}} Δ1-15β,16β-methylene{{spironolactone}}, is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group related to spironolactone that was never marketed. Animal research {{found that it was}} 3.3-fold more potent as an antimineralocorticoid relative to spironolactone. In addition to its antimineralocorticoid properties, <b>mespirenone</b> is also a progestogen, antigonadotropin, and antiandrogen. It is 2- to 3-fold as potent as spironolactone as a progestogen and antigonadotropin but its antiandrogenic activity is markedly reduced and weak (though still of significance) in comparison. <b>Mespirenone</b> is also a potent and specific enzyme inhibitor of 18-hydroxylase and thus of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis. The drug was under development by Schering (now Bayer Schering Pharma) and reached phase II clinical trials but was discontinued in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|Many spirolactone antimineralocorticoids {{that were}} never marketed like dicirenone, <b>mespirenone,</b> mexrenone, prorenone, SC-5233 (spirolactone), spirorenone, and {{spiroxasone}} also show varying degrees of activity as AR antagonists.|$|E

50|$|The spirolactones {{include the}} marketed drugs {{spironolactone}} (SC-9420; Aldactone), canrenone (SC-9376; Cantaren, Luvion), potassium canrenoate (SC-14266; Venactone, Soldactone), eplerenone (SC-66110, CGP-30083; Inspra), and drospirenone (ZK-30595; Yasmin). Spirolactones {{that were not}} ever marketed include SC-5233, SC-8109, SC-11927 (Catatoxic Steroid 1; CS-1), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), prorenoate potassium (SC-23992), 7α-thiospironolactone (SC-24813), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (SC-26519), mexrenoate potassium (SC-26714), spirorenone (ZK-35973), ZK-91587 (15β,16β-methylenemexrenone), <b>mespirenone</b> (ZK-94679), and ZK-97894 (7α-thiomethylmespirenone). Oxprenoate potassium (RU-28318) is not a spirolactone by definition but is a closely related antimineralocorticoid that was never marketed.|$|E
40|$|Excess adrenocorticosteroid hormones such as {{glucocorticoids}} and mineralocorticoids is {{well known}} to induce hypertension in several animal species {{as well as in}} humans. Therefore, the development of potent and speciﬁc glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid antagonists with antihypertensive effects is clinically necessary. steroid hormone antagonists being used therapeutically present serious endocrinology side effects such as the widely used antimineralocorticoid, spironolactone. The antiglucocorticoids available so far have been active only in vitro or only weakly in viva. Recently, three new exciting adrenocorticosteroid hormone antagonists have been synthesized. RU 486 is a potent antiglucocorticoid (and antiprogesterone with potential as an abortifacient), RU 26752 and <b>mespirenone,</b> are novel mineralocorticoid antagonists. I studied the antihypertensive effect of RU 486, RU 26752 and <b>mespirenone</b> in Sprague- Dawley rats with dexamethasone- or aldosterone-induced hypertension. In addition, the effect of these antagonists on the hypertension developed by genetic model, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were also studied. The SHR is the closest animal model to human essential hypertension and it is believed that adrenocorticosteroid hormones are involved in the induction and maintenance of the hypertension. The results obtained from my studies showed that RU 486 administered simultaneously with dexamethasone prevented the hypertension induced by dexamethasone treatment. However, RU 486 had no effect on mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension. The administration of the antimineralocorticoid RU 26752 or <b>mespirenone</b> in combination with aldosterone successfully presented aldosterone-induced hypertension but not dexamethasone- induced hypertension. Surprisingly, RU 486 caused a signiﬁcant increase in the blood pressure of the SHR whilst <b>mespirenone</b> caused a slight decrease in blood pressure as compared to control SHR. The effect of these antihormones on body/organ weights, ﬂuid intake and urinary output was observed. Morphologically examination of the heart and kidney showed no abnormalities with treatment. These results suggest that 1) RU 486 is specific in preventing dexamethasone-induced hypertension; 2) RU 26752 and <b>mespirenone</b> are successful in preventing aldosterone-induced hypertension and 3) mineralocorticoids may be involved in the development and maintenance of hypertension in the SHR...|$|E
