40|$|OBJECTIVES: Autoantibodies {{directed}} against cytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A {{have been identified}} in many patients with inclusion body myositis. This retrospective study investigated the association between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status and clinical, serological and histopathological features to explore the utility of this antibody to identify inclusion body myositis subgroups and to predict prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from various European inclusion body myositis registries were pooled. Anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A status was determined by an established ELISA technique. Cases were stratified according to antibody status and comparisons made. Survival and mobility aid requirement analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Data from 311 patients were available for analysis; 102 (33 %) had anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibodies. Antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted mortality risk (HR 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 3. 21, p= 0. 019), lower frequency of proximal upper limb weakness at disease onset (8 % vs 23 %, adjusted OR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 68, p= 0. 005) and an increased prevalence of excess of cytochrome oxidase deficient fibres on muscle biopsy analysis (87 % vs 72 %, adjusted OR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 17 to 6. 66, p= 0. 020), compared with antibody-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: Differences were observed in clinical and histopathological features between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody positive and negative patients with inclusion body myositis, and antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted <b>mortality</b> <b>risk.</b> <b>Stratification</b> <b>of</b> inclusion body myositis by anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status may be useful, potentially highlighting a distinct inclusion body myositis subtype with a more severe phenotype...|$|E

Methods We examined the association between eGFR and mortality among 16, 010 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Primary predictors were eGFR CKD-EPI and eGFR MDRD. Outcomes of interest were all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Improvement in risk categorization with eGFR CKD-EPI was evaluated using adjusted relative hazard (HR) and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI). Results Overall, 26. 9 % {{of the population was}} reclassified to higher eGFR categories and 2. 2 % to lower eGFR categories by eGFR CKD-EPI, reducing the proportion of prevalent CKD classified as stage 3 – 5 from 45. 6 % to 28. 8 %. There were 3, 620 deaths (1, 540 from CVD) during 215, 082 person-years of follow-up (median, 14. 3 [*]years).

Among those with eGFR MDRD > 60 [*]ml/min/ 1. 73 [*]m 2, 0. 5 % were reclassified to lower eGFR CKD-EPI and these individuals had a higher risk of all-cause (adjusted HR, 1. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 69) and CVD (adjusted HR, 1. 42; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 99) mortality compared with those not reclassified.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality,</b> preoperatively, for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> the patients and institution of an early goal-directed therapy. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients presenting with perforation peritonitis, in {{the age group of}} 14 - 70 years scheduled for emergency laparotomy were studied prospectively. The parameters studied were age and sex of the patients, associated co-morbidities, duration of symptoms, delay in initiating surgical intervention, and preoperative biochemical parameters such as hemoglobin, random blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, pH, base excess, and serum lactate levels. In-hospital mortality was taken as the outcome. Results: We encountered a mortality of 17. 8 % in our study. Multiple linear (enter) regression identified the age, duration of symptoms, preoperative blood sugar levels, blood urea, serum creatinine levels, Mannheim Peritonitis Index, and the delay in instituting surgical intervention as independent predictors of mortality. Hyperlactatemia, acidosis and base excess were not found to be associated with mortality.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients with moderate or severe ARDS with a length of stay of >  24  h were included in this study. Patients were assigned to four predefined risk groups: group I (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O), group II (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm), group III (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O) and group IV (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm H 2 O). Results: The analysis included 456 patients.

40|$|Objective Patients with {{repaired}} tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) have {{an increased}} long-term risk of cardiovascular morbidity and <b>mortality.</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in this population is difficult. Initial evidence suggests that cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) {{may be helpful to}} risk-stratify patients with repaired ToF. Methods and results We studied 875 patients after surgical repair for ToF (358 females, age 25. 5 ± 11. 7 year, range 7 - 75 years) who underwent CPET between 1999 and 2009. During a mean follow-up of 4. 1 ± 2. 6 years after CPET, 30 patients (3. 4 %) died or had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 225 patients (25. 7 %) had other cardiac related events (emergency admission, surgery, or catheter interventions). On multivariable Cox regression-analysis, %predicted peak oxygen uptake (V O 2 %) (p = 0. 001), resting QRS duration (p = 0. 030) and age (p < 0. 001) emerged as independent predictors of mortality or sustained VT. Patients with a peak VO 2 65 % of predicted and a resting QRS duration 170 ms had a 11. 4 -fold risk of death or sustained VT. Ventilatory efficiency expressed as VE/VCO 2 slope (p 0. 001), peak VO 2 % (p =. 001), QRS duration (p =. 001) and age (p = 0. 046) independently predicted event free survival. VE/VCO 2 slope 31. 0, peak VO 2 % 65 % and QRS duration 170 ms were the cut-off points with best sensitivity and specificity to detect an unfavorable outcome. Conclusions CPET is an important predictive tool that may assist in the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> patients with ToF.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: New {{scores have}} been {{developed}} and validated in the US for in-hospital <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty: the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) risk score and the Mayo Clinic Risk Score (MCRS). We sought to validate these scores in a European population with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to compare their predictive accuracy {{with that of the}} GRACE risk score. METHODS: In a single-center ACS registry of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a graphical representation of observed vs. expected mortality, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) /integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis to compare the scores. RESULTS: A total of 2148 consecutive patients were included, mean age 63 years (SD 13), 74 % male and 71 % with ST-segment elevation ACS. In-hospital mortality was 4. 5 %. The GRACE score showed the best AUC (0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 0. 96) compared with NCDR (0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 91, p= 0. 0003) and MCRS (0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 90, p= 0. 0003). In model calibration analysis, GRACE showed the best predictive power. With GRACE, patients were more often correctly classified than with MCRS (NRI 78. 7, 95 % CI 59. 6 - 97. 7; IDI 0. 136, 95 % CI 0. 073 - 0. 199) or NCDR (NRI 79. 2, 95 % CI 60. 2 - 98. 2; IDI 0. 148, 95 % CI 0. 087 - 0. 209).
