5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> could have been saved.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|When the California Republic was assimilated {{into the}} United States in 1848, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} into the Santa Ana River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale. The city of Santa Ana Viejo, the original location of Santa Ana, was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of San Bernardino, gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> to the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The Islamic {{resurgence}} {{has been}} less a renewal of faith and dedication than a public resurfacing of perspectives and ideals previously relegated to less public, informal relations under impact of European secular influences. They are not medieval Islamic ideals, but ideas from the past that remained vital to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples,</b> and now are used to interpret the problems of contemporary times. The Turco-Persian Islamic tradition provided the elements they have used to express their shared concerns.|$|R
50|$|The {{lake was}} named Lake Rudolf (in honour of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria) by Count Sámuel Teleki de Szék and his second-in-command Lieutenant Ludwig Ritter Von Höhnel, a Hungarian and an Austrian, on 6 March 1888.

25|$|Adivasi Colony is a {{backwards}} {{community of}} Ambalakars living in ramshackle huts of mud, coconut fronds and palmyrah {{leaves on the}} edge of Kodaikarai village.

Chief Redbird and some Cherokee Chiefs also appear to have fought in the Kings Mountain, NC area with the Colonials in the U.S. Revolutionary War in the Battle of Kings Mountain or other nearby battles. Later, many Cherokee linked to them turned against the Colonials like Shelby who supported removing and killing Indians, including Cherokee.

25|$|Due to the 1973 {{spike in}} oil prices, {{the economy of}} Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the economy of Iran was {{experiencing}} double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976, an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> opposed the Shah's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.|$|E
25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game.

Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance to see and hear the band.|$|E
25|$|Commerce, transportation, {{services}} and tourism accounts for 59% of the state's GDP and employs just over 50% {{of the working}} population. The growth of the commerce sector is due to urbanization {{and the growth of}} tourism. The biggest selling point of the state touristically is its location, just south of Mexico City, which has the largest and wealthiest population in the country. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> come to spend the weekend in Cuernavaca's nightclubs and away from Mexico City's traffic and pollution. Many of these visitors have bought second homes here, which has driven property prices up.

25|$|Hidalgo was {{met with}} an outpouring of support. Intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people {{followed}} Hidalgo {{with a great deal}} of enthusiasm. Hidalgo permitted Indians and mestizos to join his war in such numbers that the original motives of the Querétaro group were obscured. Allende was Hidalgo's co-conspirator in Querétaro and remained more loyal to the Querétaro group's original, more creole objectives. However, Hidalgo's actions and the people's response, meant he would lead and not Allende. Allende had acquired military training when Mexico established a colonial militia; Hidalgo had no military training at all. The people who followed Hidalgo also had no military training, experience or equipment. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were poor who were angry after many years of hunger and oppression.

El Rosario is named after the local ejido which belongs to about 10,000 “campesinos” or rural farmers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> make a living through farming and the sale of handcrafts and foods to tourists.

25|$|Although {{the gold}} rush {{attracted}} {{tens of thousands of}} newcomers to the San Joaquin River area, deposits of the precious mineral petered out within a few years, especially on {{the upper reaches of the}} San Joaquin and its tributaries which were only suitable for placer mining. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> settled in the San Joaquin Valley, most in the existing towns such as Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield but some establishing new settlements.

Established in 1851, the town maintained considerable size until 1880, when trade competition from nearby Stockton caused it to diminish. Another notable but much smaller settlement was Las Juntas, near present-day Mendota. This was a haven for criminals and fugitives, and was frequented by the infamous bandits Joaquín Murrieta and Tiburcio Vásquez.|$|E

In the 1950s, the clock was reconstructed under the influence of Soviet government; it features a procession of proletarians rather than saints. After the war, the government participated in the expulsion of ethnic Germans from the country, following the Allied leaders' Potsdam Agreement, which redefined the Central European borders, although <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people's</b> families had lived for two centuries in the region.|$|R

50|$|Future explorers {{would also}} {{take notice of}} Yermak’s {{strategy}} in approaching the Siberian lands, which, unlike those in many other colonization attempts, already had an established imperial power. However, Yermak wisely recognized that Kuchum’s territories were not unified.

Unlike Kuchum and his Mohammedan Tatars, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups were pagan. Due to the sum <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differences, <b>many</b> simply paid tribute to avoid trouble, and it mattered little to whom the tribute was paid.
