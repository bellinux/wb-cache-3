5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the <b>Medicaid</b> extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} <b>Medicaid</b> had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand <b>Medicaid</b> had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose <b>Medicaid</b> funding if they didn't expand <b>Medicaid</b> under the ACA, several states rejected expanded <b>Medicaid</b> coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers for Medicare and <b>Medicaid</b> Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained <b>Medicaid</b> coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{who live}} in states that {{opt out of the}} <b>Medicaid</b> {{expansion}} and who qualify for neither existing <b>Medicaid</b> coverage nor subsidized coverage through the states' new insurance exchanges.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion could maintain their <b>Medicaid</b> eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make <b>Medicaid</b> available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for <b>Medicaid,</b> those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both <b>Medicaid</b> and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for <b>Medicaid</b> in Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The Court further {{determined}} that states {{could not be}} forced to participate in the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion. ACA withheld all <b>Medicaid</b> funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting <b>Medicaid</b> funding.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve publishes data on {{premature}} death rates by county, {{defined as those}} dying below age 74. According to the Kaiser Foundation, expanding <b>Medicaid</b> in the remaining 19 states would cover up to 4.5 million persons. Since expanding <b>Medicaid</b> expands coverage and expanding coverage reduces mortality, therefore expanding <b>Medicaid</b> reduces mortality by syllogism. Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina, indicated on the map at right as having many counties with high premature mortality rates could therefore reduce mortality by expanding <b>Medicaid,</b> other things equal.|$|E
5|$|Those {{states that}} {{expanded}} <b>Medicaid</b> had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand <b>Medicaid</b> had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. As of December 2016 there were 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the <b>Medicaid</b> extension, while 19 states had not.|$|E

5|$|Lawsuits such as King v. Burwell, which {{resulted}} in a decision by the Supreme Court that limited <b>Medicaid</b> expansion but upheld the mandates and insurance subsidies. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, not expanding <b>Medicaid</b> in 19 states has increased the number uninsured by an estimated 4.5 million persons.|$|E
5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding <b>Medicaid</b> and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that <b>Medicaid</b> be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, <b>Medicaid</b> is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before <b>Medicaid</b> would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving <b>Medicaid</b> coverage by 2021.|$|E
5|$|Illegal immigrants, {{estimated}} at around 8 million—or roughly {{a third of}} the 23 million projection—are ineligible for insurance subsidies and <b>Medicaid.</b> They remain eligible for emergency services.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—a {{private health insurance}} employer mandate, federalization of <b>Medicaid</b> for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of <b>Medicaid</b> by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and <b>Medicaid</b> in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, <b>Medicaid,</b> and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of <b>Medicaid,</b> and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 DHHS {{study found}} that states that {{expanded}} <b>Medicaid</b> had lower premiums on exchange policies, because they had fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.|$|E
5|$|As of March 2016 11.1 {{million people}} had {{purchased}} exchange plans, while an estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained <b>Medicaid</b> coverage, mostly low-income adults. 11.1 million were still covered, {{a decline of}} nearly 13 percent. 6.1 million uninsured 19-25 year olds gained coverage.|$|E
5|$|Further {{following}} {{his opposition to}} government intervention, Reagan cut the budgets of non-military programs including <b>Medicaid,</b> food stamps, federal education programs and the EPA. While he protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Jones {{registered}} as a Democrat, citing his disenchantment with the Nixon administration and {{his desire to}} participate in Kentucky primary elections. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in Kentucky by a 2-to-1 margin. Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. named him {{to the board of}} directors for the University of Kentucky and the Chandler Medical Center. In the mid-1980s, Jones created the Kentucky Health Care Access Foundation to provide free health care to individuals who fell below the poverty line but did not qualify for <b>Medicaid.</b> Governor Martha Layne Collins chose Jones to chair her <b>Medicaid</b> Program Review Team and serve on her Council on Education Reform.|$|E
5|$|In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius {{decided on}} June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court {{ruled that the}} {{individual}} mandate was constitutional when the associated penalties were construed as a tax. The decision allowed states {{to opt out of}} the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion. Several did so, although some later accepted the expansion.|$|E
5|$|The act {{includes}} {{a host of}} delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions, bundled payment initiatives, the Center for Medicare and <b>Medicaid</b> Innovation, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, {{and the creation of}} Accountable care organizations.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Armenian American {{criminal}} {{organizations have}} received widespread media attention, such {{as during the}} 2010 <b>Medicaid</b> fraud. However, {{in the city of}} Glendale, California, where Armenians compose 27% of city's total population, only 17% of the crime in the city were committed by Armenians in 2006. A gang named Armenian Power, composed of some 200 Armenian Americans, has operated in Los Angeles County since the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Conner {{alleged that}} Patton {{arranged}} regulatory favors for {{the nursing home}} while the affair was ongoing. Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety rules. By July 2002, the state had pulled all Medicare and <b>Medicaid</b> payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E
5|$|During FY 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & <b>Medicaid</b> ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example <b>Medicaid</b> reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|Increase {{the supply}} of labor and {{aggregate}} compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021-2025 period. CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for <b>Medicaid</b> and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|Insurance {{coverage}} helps save lives, {{by encouraging}} {{early detection and}} prevention of dangerous medical conditions. According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013. City University public health professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of the ACA's <b>Medicaid</b> expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.|$|E
5|$|Obama's most {{significant}} legacy {{is generally considered}} to be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's {{most significant}} regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and <b>Medicaid</b> in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand <b>Medicaid</b> or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
5|$|Planned Parenthood and the ACLU {{subsequently}} {{brought a}} lawsuit against the state alleging it was being targeted unfairly, that the state law violated federal <b>medicaid</b> laws, and that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. A May 11 ruling allowing the case to move forward, but denied the request from the petitioners to grant a temporary injunction to restore the funding; however, a June 24 ruling prohibited the state from enforcing the law.|$|E
5|$|Ryan has an {{interest}} in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, <b>Medicaid,</b> and education.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{mandate is}} {{the requirement to}} buy insurance or pay a penalty for everyone not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, <b>Medicaid,</b> Medicare or other public insurance programs (such as Tricare). Also exempt were those facing a financial hardship or who were members in a recognized religious sect exempted by the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|This {{estimate}} was made {{prior to the}} Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states {{to opt out of}} the <b>Medicaid</b> expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, Mathias {{served on}} {{numerous}} boards and committees. He {{was a member}} of the Governor's Commission on State Taxes and Tax Structure (1989–1990), a member of the Maryland Civil War Heritage Commission (1992–1995), a member of the Kaiser Commission on <b>Medicaid</b> and the Uninsured, co-chair of the Task Force on the Presidential Appointment and Senate Confirmation Process (1996), a member of the board of the George C. Marshall International Center, a member of the board of the Center for Responsive Politics, a member of the board of WorldSpace Satellite Radio, and board member emeritus of Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies. Additionally, Mathias served on the Board of Trustees of Enterprise Foundation (now Enterprise Community Partners) from 1980 through 2001.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from <b>Medicaid</b> for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's <b>Medicaid</b> expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights {{to the story of}} her life. She said that she would accept on {{condition}} that the money was enough to balance Michigan's state deficit, $900,000,000 at that time. No film rights were obtained. Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, <b>Medicaid</b> funds, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E
5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of <b>Medicaid</b> for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
