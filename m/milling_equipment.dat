25|$|The first {{recorded}} attempt to extract useful work from a Manitoba river was in 1829 at a flour mill (known as Grant's Mill) located on Sturgeon Creek {{in what is}} now Winnipeg. This was not successful and the <b>milling</b> <b>equipment</b> was later operated by a windmill.|$|E
25|$|Allis-Chalmers was a U.S. {{manufacturer}} of machinery for various industries. Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery {{for use in}} industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company (steam engines and mill equipment), Fraser & Chalmers (mining and ore <b>milling</b> <b>equipment),</b> the Gates Iron Works (rock and cement <b>milling</b> <b>equipment),</b> and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company (engines and compressors). It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{internal}} designs of the Beverly mill were hidden due to concerns of competitors stealing designs. The beginning efforts were all researched behind closed doors, {{even to the point}} that the owners of the mill set up <b>milling</b> <b>equipment</b> on their estates to experiment with the process. There were no published articles describing exactly how their process worked in detail. Additionally, the mill's horse-powered technology was quickly dwarfed by new water-powered methods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies on}} the design methods and key {{technologies}} {{of the system of}} rolling <b>mill</b> <b>equipments</b> management based on Web, in accordance with the the practical needs. This system adopted B/S as its structure, while developing software for rolling <b>mill</b> <b>equipments</b> management on the platform of Microsoft Visual Studio. NET. The system uses a three-tier hierarchical structure: User layer, Web Server layer and Database server layer. User layer refers to the user through the browser to complete the system remote services and information sharing. Web server layer is the link to contact the browser and the database, and used to store system function modular and application program. Database server layer is mainly used to store various data required for the system after being put into practice for a period, the efficiency of maintenance and management of rolling <b>mill</b> <b>equipments</b> has been increased obviously, thus the method can be used in the maintenance of rolling <b>mill</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

25|$|With the {{combining}} of {{the constituent}} firms, Allis-Chalmers offered {{a wide array}} of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore <b>milling</b> <b>equipment,</b> various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including , slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.|$|E
25|$|The next mill on {{the river}} was Town Mill, which had been built in 1744, and was used for {{grinding}} corn and malt. The miller, William Smith, negotiated with the Duke, and in 1785 he sold the corn <b>milling</b> <b>equipment</b> and refitted it for working with cotton. Having also refitted Field Mill in the autumn, he started a Sunday School in 1786, so that his young workers would be equipped with basic reading and mathematical skills, as well as moral instruction. The practice spread, and Mansfield became known for the good education of its young people. Town Mill became Old Town Mill in 1870, when a steam-powered mill was built {{to the east of}} the river, which became known as New Town Mill. Stantons Mill, the next downstream, was built in 1795. By 1900, it had been taken over by Luke Weatherall, who made workmen's boots there. The final textile mill {{on the river}} in Mansfield at the time was Bath Mill, on Bath Lane, which began operation in 1792 producing worsted cloth. Benjamin Bagshaw, John Radford and George Simes were the men behind the venture, {{but it was not a}} success, and the mill had become a cotton mill by 1800, when it also became one of the first locations in the vicinity to install a steam engine. One effect of the conversion of mills for cotton, rather than grinding corn, was that a number of windmills were built, since corn still had to be milled into flour. The number of windmills in Mansfield rose from three to thirteen between 1774 and 1824.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish {{immigrant}} to America {{who came}} to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour-milling equipment. The Gates firm [...] "built the first steam-operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country." [...] In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser & Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement <b>milling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
