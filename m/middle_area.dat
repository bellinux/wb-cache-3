The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly {{to the rear of the}} capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a number of teeth along the masticatory margin (the <b>middle</b> <b>area</b> of the mandibles) and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal sternite.|$|E
25|$|Early Vedic {{religion}} {{does not}} have a concept of Hell. Ṛg-veda mentions three realms, bhūr (the earth), svar (the sky) and bhuvas or antarikṣa (the <b>middle</b> <b>area,</b> i.e. air or atmosphere). In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called naraka (in Devanāgarī: नरक). Yama as the first born human (together with his twin sister Yamī), by virtue of precedence, becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure. Originally he resides in Heaven, but later, especially medieval, traditions mention his court in naraka.|$|E
25|$|As of 4 January, {{there is}} almost total {{blackout}} in Gaza City, North Gaza, <b>Middle</b> <b>Area</b> and Khan Yunis. 90% of the telephone network, including both cellular service and land lines, is down, since it depends on backup generators with dwindling fuel stocks. Since the Israeli ground operation, 75% of Gaza's electricity has been cut off and the Palestinian technicians face difficulties reaching damaged lines because of the military attacks. As of 7 January, much {{of the population of}} the Gaza Strip continues to live without electricity. By 16 January, the twenty first day of the attacks, most households still do not have any electricity. As of 22 January, twenty five days after the beginnings of the attacks, 40 percent of the 1.5 million population remains without electricity. The remaining 60 percent receive only intermittent supply that can reach only 6 hours per day in the north of the Gaza strip. Spare parts and other equipments are a priority. After 8 days of the ceasefire, a month since the beginning of the attacks, the power plant is working on only one turbine, producing 30 MW instead of the daily full capacity of 80 MW cause of the lack of industrial fuel. By 29 January, the electricity situation has returned to its pre-27 December status, with much of the Gaza strip receiving only intermittent electricity. Certain areas are receiving very little power as a result or some low-voltage lines breakage. In order to meet demand throughout the territory, GEDCO (Gaza Electricity Distribution Co.) has put in place a power cut schedule where Gaza and North Gaza will face power cuts of eight hours three times a week; and the <b>Middle</b> <b>Area</b> and Khan Yunis will face power cuts of 6–8 hours twice per week. Those cuts does include unintentional power cuts.|$|E

25|$|The old City Hall {{was built}} in 1906–1907 after the {{construction}} plans of Komor Marcell and Jakab Dezső. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading {{to the first floor}}, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by Gothic architecture. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of the front hall include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of the banister resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on Hungarian-Székely folk motives made of polychromatic ceramics. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the <b>middle</b> <b>area</b> of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated Gábor Bethlen, Francis II Rákóczi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc Deák and Franz Joseph I of Austria are missing from the halls.|$|E

[...] It is {{constructed}} in three concentric areas (Kahn called them [...] "doughnuts"). In the words of Robert McCarter, author of Louis I. Kahn, [...] "From {{the very beginning of}} the design process, Kahn conceived of the three types of spaces as if they were three buildings constructed of different materials and of different scales – buildings-within-buildings". The outer area, which houses the reading carrels, is made of brick. [...] The <b>middle</b> <b>area,</b> which contains the heavy book stacks, is made of reinforced concrete. [...] The inner area is an atrium.|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of Howard's Conan and Hyboria {{in the popular}} imagination owes much to Frazetta's distinctive oil paintings. [...] While Nihilistic's writers tried {{to tell a story}} in Howard's style, its artists attempted to emulate Frazetta's style on the electronic display screen. [...] Instead of making each computer representation as realistic as possible, they created models based mainly on their perception of each object's intrinsic nature. [...] The artists used video graphics technology such as normal mapping technique to emulate brush strokes on the models' textures. [...] These digital brush strokes were visible on the cliffs in the game. [...] The character models were outlined with light colors instead of dark ones, creating the subtle blend of object and background found in oil paintings, and fog effects allowed the team to recreate Frazetta's use of shadows in the <b>middle</b> <b>area</b> of the image. [...] To complete the game's appearance, the artists used darker color palettes, motifs, and themes to present a more serious mood, in harmony with the gore and nudity in the game.|$|E

2500|$|In its unexcited state, {{the vagina}} is a {{collapsed}} tube, with the anterior and posterior walls placed together. The lateral walls, especially their <b>middle</b> <b>area,</b> are relatively more rigid. Because of this, the collapsed vagina has a H-shaped cross section. Behind, the inner vagina {{is separated from}} the rectum by the recto-uterine pouch, the middle vagina by loose connective tissue, and the lower vagina by the perineal body. [...] Where the vaginal lumen surrounds the cervix of the uterus, it is divided into four continuous regions or vaginal fornices; these are the anterior, posterior, right lateral, and left lateral fornices. The posterior fornix is deeper than the anterior fornix.|$|E
2500|$|Their central {{position}} {{enables them}} to have an all-round view of the match. [...] Since most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played. It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the <b>middle</b> <b>area</b> of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder {{is expected to have}} good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game. They also need to be good at tackling to win the ball back.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} play [...] "doubles", {{proponents of the}} [...] "heel up" [...] {{technique}} use either one of two techniques: the [...] "slide technique" [...] or the heel-toe technique. In the slide technique, the pedal is struck around the <b>middle</b> <b>area</b> with the ball of the foot. As the drum produces a sound, the toe is slid up the pedal. After the first stroke, the pedal will naturally bounce back, hit the toe as it slides upwards, and rebound for a second strike. In the heel-toe technique the foot is suspended above the foot-board of the pedal. The entire foot is brought down and the ball of the foot strikes the pedal. The foot snaps up, the heel comes off the footboard, and the toes come down for a second stroke. Once mastered either technique allows the player to play very fast double strokes on the bass drum. Noted players include Rod Morgenstein, Tim Waterson (who formerly held the world record for the fastest playing on a bass drum), Tomas Haake, Chris Adler, Derek Roddy, Danny Carey, Hellhammer. The technique is commonly used in death metal and other extreme forms of music.|$|E
