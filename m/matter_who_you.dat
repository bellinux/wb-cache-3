40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} various types of agglomeration externalities on the survival rate of entrepreneurial firms. In particular, we trace the population cohort of newly-established and self-employed Swedish firms in the Knowledge-Intensive Business Service sector in 1997 up to 2012 and investigate the role of Marshallian and Jacobian externalities on the survival of these firms. We find that only Jacobian externalities (diversity) is positively associated with the survival of entrepreneurial firms. Not all Jacobian externalities matter though. Only the higher the &# 039;related variety&# 039; of the region in which an entrepreneurial firm is founded, the higher will be the survival chance of the firm, while &# 039;unrelated variety&# 039; barely has any significant correlation. The result is robust after controlling for extensive firm characteristics and individual characteristics of the founders. The main message here is: for a newly-established entrepreneurial firm, not only it <b>matters</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, but also where you are...|$|R

On the news of future remakes, however, O'Barr stated: [...] " [...] I don't have great expectations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{gender inequality}} in the ‘new economy’, and specifically looks at gendered patterns {{of work in}} the advertising industry through a micro-level social network perspective. This study focuses on the advertising industry because it is an exemplar of a project-based creative industry in the knowledge-based ‘new economy’ where project work is becoming more common and careers are constructed as portfolios of previous experiences rather than life-time employment by one employer. In these creative industries, despite the rhetoric of flexibility, egalitarianism and non-hierarchical structures, I show how categorical inequalities (in particular gender) shape labour market outcomes, demonstrating how gender is often more important than performance in facilitating career trajectories of workers. In contrast to the all-encompassing and simplistic notions of ‘social networks’ commonly employed in much of economic geography, I unpack the concept of social networks and specify how social networks confer advantages, and document what those advantages are so we know why it <b>matters</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> know. First, I show that personal ties are important because they direct the flow of power, information, and help workers acquire legitimacy, skills, and jobs. Second, I demonstrate there are important differences in men’s and women’s social networks, which drive differences in the opportunity structures available to men and women. Third, I show how men and women have different ‘creative biographies’ and different experiences of project-based work. Fourth, my thesis develops a specifically geographical understanding of workers’ careers, showing how an appreciation of place-based cultures of working and socialising are crucial to an understanding of employment patterns. Finally, I provide policy implications. Overall, I demonstrate that micro-level processes contribute to macro-level patterns of gender inequality. Crucially, these findings assert the importance of micro-level social networks in determining labour market outcomes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Sam Pepper, one of {{the contestants}} in Big Brother 11, at one point accused fellow housemates Josie and John James of feigning romantic {{feelings}} for each other in order {{to cash in on}} lucrative deals with celebrity magazines such as OK! and Hello!. The provocation caused much apparent offence, and led to a prolonged and predominantly rancorous debate about authenticity and inauthenticity, soon extending to revelations that other housemates (Rachel, Corinne) aimed to appear in soft pornography titles like Nuts and Zoo, and as such, ‘couldn’t be trusted’. The clear subtext was that any economic motivation was considered a breach of the rules of the Big Brother game – not the explicit parameters of the competition, but the spirit in which it should be played. Being a worthy winner is a <b>matter</b> of <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are rather than what you do, which raises the question of how we came to know Josie and co, as well as how we come to know celebrity selves generally.
