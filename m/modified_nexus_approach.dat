The main issue is to know whether output tax incentives such as Patent Box regimes could be considered as selective State aid by the ECJ. The chapter considers this issue both prior to any amendments suggested by the OECD BEPS Action 5, and after potential implementation of the <b>modified</b> <b>nexus</b> <b>approach.</b> The result of this investigation shows that some features of the patent box regimes could trigger the application of article 107 (1) TFEU. Additionally, a notification under the State aid modernization rules would not lead to a positive decision as several doubts remain on how output tax incentives such as Patent box regimes remedy the market failures for which a State aid is granted, i. e. increasing R&D&I in the EU (and not in one Member State only) ...|$|E

To successfully put the W-E-F nexus into practice we should build on the strengths of existing mechanisms, while also improving coordination and integration of seemingly divergent approaches in the water, energy, and food sectors.

Critical issues emerging across the three sectors ask for different policies at different governance levels. However, at each level of policy making the impact at local level should be an important point of reference. In line with this, the case of the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia exemplifies how international energy politics affect local farmers’ access to irrigation water. Moreover, a comparative study of three states in India shows that local differences in the implementation of the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> can lead to different outcomes in terms of groundwater and electricity use for agriculture.

A closer look at the underlying rationales and proposed policy instruments, however, suggests that the primary scope of the conference proceedings is not a normative one, but one that reframes the conflict between distributional justice and the needs of the world economy under the paradigm of security. Reading this slightly shifted perspective through a Foucauldian lens, we propose that security is now put forward as the key mechanism to foster a new 'green' economy, and that the needs of the poorest are, if anything at all, a secondary effect of the proposed <b>nexus</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R

For example, this Article asserts that the ADA cannot apply to all Internet websites because the statute applies only to physical places of public accommodation. A judgment regarding the essence of the Internet is, of course, imbedded in this conclusion. The Internet is something other than a physical “place. ” Additionally, relying on the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> recognizes that although the Internet is not a place, it provides critical communication services and accessibility to goods and services sold by places of public accommodation. Therefore, the ADA should regulate the manner in which these physical places of public accommodation use their website to communicate with the public and to permit access to their goods and services because those types of roles should qualify as having a nexus to the place of public accommoda- tion. Finally, reliance on the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> to conclude that the ADA plays only a limited role with regard to private websites reflects a value judgment regarding the applicability of statutory regulation to unforeseen, yet transformative, technological advancements such as the Internet. Applying the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> involves a conscious decision that Congress, not the judiciary, is {{in the best position to}} regulate the Internet because Congress can, and should, balance the needs of the Internet industry with the requirements of individuals with disabili- ties. All of these broader issues are inherently contained in any discussion of whether the ADA applies generally to Internet websites; this Article addresses them within that context. Part II of this Article provides a brief overview of the ADA’s require- ments as well as an examination of the analyses used by the court in Access Now and the NCD in arriving at contradictory conclusions regarding the ADA’s application to the Internet. Part III sets forth the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> and its application to the Internet. Specifically, Part III analyzes both the ADA’s statutory language and the nature of the Internet for support regarding application of the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach.</b> The final section of Part III provides normative justifications for the application of the <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> rather than either of the more extreme alternatives.

The objective {{of this study was}} to validate a <b>modified</b> <b>NEXUS</b> criteria in a low-risk elderly fall population with two changes: a modified definition for distracting injury and the definition of normal mentation. Methods: This is a prospective, observational cohort study of geriatric fall patients who presented to a Level I trauma center and were not triaged to the trauma bay. Providers enrolled non-intoxicated patients at baseline mental status with no lateralizing neurologic deficits. They recorded midline neck tenderness, signs of trauma, and presence of other distracting injury. Results: We enrolled 800 patients. One patient fall event was excluded due to duplicate enrollment, and four were lost to follow up, leaving 795 for analysis. Average age was 83. 6 (range 65 - 101). The numbers in parenthesis after the negative predictive value represent confidence interval. There were 11 (1. 4 %) cervical spine injuries. One hundred seventeen patients had midline tenderness and seven of these had CSI; 366 patients had signs of trauma to the face/neck, and 10 of these patients had CSI. Using signs of trauma to the head/neck as the only distracting injury and baseline mental status as normal alertness, the <b>modified</b> <b>NEXUS</b> criteria was 100 % sensitive (CI [67. 9 - 100]) with a negative predictive value of 100 (98. 7 - 100).

Recent research advocates that solutions to the global water security and scarcity crisis must involve water–energy <b>nexus</b> <b>approaches.</b> This means adopting policies and strategies that harmonize these inter-related sectors to minimize environmental impact while maximizing human benefit. In the case of Abu Dhabi, when designing and locating oil/gas refineries and associated power generation facilities, previous relevant decisions were based on simple economic and geographical grounds, such as nearness to oil rigs, pipelines, existing industries and port facilities, etc. The subsequent design and location of water abstraction and treatment works operated by the waste heat from these refining and/or power generation processes was catered for as an afterthought, meaning that there is now a mismatch between the water and energy supplies and demands.

Conventional energy and food production are emitters of greenhouse gases, but measures to reduce emissions—including renewable energy interventions, such as subsidies for biofuel production—can have adverse consequences on food prices. To achieve desirable and sustainable outcomes for water, food, and energy requires investigating these elements as an integrated whole, across sectors and scales. The <b>nexus</b> <b>approach</b> is part of broader systems thinking; it features a pragmatic focus on the relatively limited number of policy choices that are constrained by political realities. This approach recognizes and minimizes trade-offs, builds synergies, and increases resource use efficiencies...|$|R
