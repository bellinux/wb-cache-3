5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September10, with evidence of a low-level circulation and convective banding. It moved west-northwestward, located south of a subtropical ridge. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Nine by 1200UTC on September11 to the south of the Cape Verde islands. Upon its formation, the center was poorly defined, with restricted easterly outflow due to easterly wind shear. After about 24hours of remaining somewhat disorganized, the convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> on September12 as banding features and outflow improved. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gert, the seventh named storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moving westward off the African coast on October 1, 2001 {{entered the}} tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until October 4 {{as it moved}} westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an {{area of low pressure}} was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated,</b> and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October18, the system {{consolidated}} and developed a small, defined circulation. Associated convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> around its center. Another gap wind event soon impacted the system, temporarily delaying development of the disturbance into a tropical depression. The low soon relocated to the northeast, aligning itself east of the gap wind event which aided in development. A small, well-defined circulation formed by early on October20 within a broader cyclonic circulation. With increasing deep convection, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression, assigned the identifier Twenty-E, by 06:00UTC. Upon its designation, the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated from a tropical wave off {{the southern coast}} of Mexico in late May2006. An area of convection {{was associated with the}} wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June1, the convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated,</b> and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} trough, and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|Due to New Mexico's {{position}} in the southwestern United States, there are three primary causes for flooding within {{the state in the}} autumn months: the effects of tropical cyclones, the North American Monsoon, or an approaching cold front. Tropical cyclones and they're from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans affect the state, usually in southern New Mexico. Storms that originate from the Atlantic Ocean usually move through the Gulf of Mexico on a northwest trajectory, typically during the month of September. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific usually maintain a fast north-northeast track, occasionally through the Gulf of California, and generally affect the state from the middle of September to the middle of October. The accompanying moisture of the Pacific storms encounter the mountains of the state, and through orographic lift, produce heavy rainfall. Due to the storms' fast movement, the rainfall events accompanying Pacific storms are generally shorter lasting and <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> than other such storms in the state.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

5|$|Early on July26, the {{thunderstorms}} {{along the}} tropical wave became <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> {{to the south}} of Cuba, in association with a low-pressure area. The system continued to organize, and by 0600UTC on July27, the surface circulation became defined enough for it to be classified as a tropical depression about 60mi (95km) northeast of Cancún, Mexico. Within twelve hours, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Operationally, the system was not known to be a tropical cyclone until 2100UTC on July27, after a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system confirmed the presence of a closed, albeit elongated, circulation center. At that point, the NHC classified it as Tropical Storm Don. Upon forming, the storm moved to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level ridge over the northern Gulf of Mexico. Due to generally favorable conditions, including warm waters and light to moderate wind shear, the NHC predicted steady intensification to winds of at least 65mph (100km/h). However, none of the tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated much strengthening.|$|E

It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster.

A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gonzalo {{originated}} in a tropical wave {{that emerged from}} the western coast of Africa on October 4 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite an attendant expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an upper-level trough hindered cyclogenesis. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, the system developed <b>more</b> <b>concentrated</b> convection. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small low pressure area by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00UTC on October 12, located approximately 390mi (630km) east of the Leeward Islands. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low wind shear yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a Hurricane Hunter flight into the system reported surface winds of 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
