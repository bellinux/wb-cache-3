5|$|The <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> {{distinguish}} {{sides of}} the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|Various {{methods to}} {{construct}} Penrose tilings have been discovered, including <b>matching</b> <b>rules,</b> substitutions or subdivision rules, cut and project schemes and coverings.|$|E
5|$|These {{coverings}} {{have been}} considered as a realistic model {{for the growth of}} quasicrystals: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the unit cells from which crystals are constructed, and the <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.|$|E

5|$|The <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> can be {{described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a {{specific}} restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E
5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an {{aperiodic}} set of six prototiles, {{introduced by}} Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling {{can be viewed as a}} completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E

A match hypothesis represents a possible mapping between any part of the source and the target. This mapping is controlled by a set of <b>match</b> <b>rules.</b> By changing the <b>match</b> <b>rules,</b> one can change the type of reasoning SME does. For example, one set of <b>match</b> <b>rules</b> may perform a kind of analogy called literal similarity. and another performs a kind of analogy called true-analogy. These rules are not the place where domain-dependent information is added, but rather where the analogy process is tweaked, {{depending on the type of}} cognitive function the user is trying to emulate.|$|R

25|$|Non-periodic tilings {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by projection of higher-dimensional structures into spaces with lower dimensionality and under some circumstances there can be tiles that enforce this non-periodic structure and so are aperiodic. The Penrose tiles are {{the first and most}} famous example of this, as first noted in the pioneering work of de Bruijn. There is yet no complete (algebraic) characterization of cut and project tilings that can be enforced by <b>matching</b> <b>rules,</b> although numerous necessary or sufficient conditions are known.|$|E
500|$|In these decompositions, {{there appears}} to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be {{decomposed}} in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> [...] furthermore, the <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> also determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.|$|E
50|$|To summarize, {{the intern}} <b>match</b> <b>rules</b> compute a {{structural}} evaluation {{score for each}} <b>match</b> hypothesis. These <b>rules</b> enforce the systematicity principle.

Furthermore, hash function is designed to <b>match</b> <b>rules</b> in disorder group, while indexing algorithm is proposed to <b>match</b> <b>rules</b> in the queue group.

500|$|The {{three types}} of Penrose tiling, P1P3, are {{described}} individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by <b>matching</b> <b>rules</b> in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces [...] alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.|$|E
500|$|Starting with a {{collection}} of tiles from a given tiling (which might be a single tile, a tiling of the plane, or any other collection), deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations. In one generation of deflation, each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled-down versions of tiles used in the original tiling. The substitution rules guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the <b>matching</b> <b>rules.</b> Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles.|$|E
