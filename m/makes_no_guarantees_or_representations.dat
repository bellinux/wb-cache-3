This means that the network <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> about packets' proper arrival (see also Internet Protocol#Reliability). This was an important design principle and change from the previous protocols used on the early ARPANET. Since packet delivery across diverse networks is an inherently unreliable and failure-prone operation, the burden of providing reliability was placed with the end points of a communication path, i.e., the hosts, {{rather than on the}} network. This {{is one of the reasons}} of the resiliency of the Internet against individual link failures and its proven scalability.|$|R

Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.|$|R
