5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|Starting on {{a bridge}} across the Menominee River, M-95 runs north along Carpenter Avenue in Kingsford. It turns east along Ludington Street in Iron Mountain and joins the US 2/US 141 {{concurrency}} out of town to the north, following Stephenson Avenue. Near the state line northwest of Iron Mountain, M-95 turns northward as a solo route through northern Dickinson County. There is a concurrency with M-69 from Randville to Sagola. Randville is {{just south of the}} junction with M-69 where the mining settlement formed because of the nearby Groveland Mine and was a station on the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Northern Railroad in 1880. A post office was in operation in Randville from 1891 until 1932.|$|E

5|$|The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Atlanta. They {{play in the}} National League East division. They were based in <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Boston before moving to Atlanta for the 1966 season. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Atlanta Braves have used 19 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 47seasons in Atlanta. The 19 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 14wins, 20losses and 13no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{sport of}} {{baseball}} {{began to be}} played {{in the years following}} the Civil War; a team known as the St. Louis Brown Stockings was founded in 1875. The Brown Stockings were {{a founding member of the}} National League and became a hometown favorite, defeating the Chicago White Stockings (later the Chicago Cubs) in their opener on May 6, 1875. The original Brown Stockings club closed in 1878, and an unrelated National League team with the same name was founded in 1882. This team repeatedly changed its name, shortening to the Browns in 1883, becoming the Perfectos in 1899, and settling on the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900. In 1902, a team moved to St. Louis from <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> adopted the name St. Louis Browns, although they had no relation to the previous Browns or Brown Stockings. From 1902 until the 1950s, St. Louis was home to two Major League teams.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula {{were to be}} designated. However, the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 than on the final 1926 map. In the original plan, US102 was supposed to replace M-15 from US2 at Rapid River, continue via Marquette into Baraga County, and end at US41 near Covington. At the same time, US41 was to have followed US2 from Powers to Crystal Falls and continued north to Covington. However, when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11, 1926, US41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette, and US102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington. In both plans, US 141 was only routed between <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Green Bay, replacing WIS17 and WIS16. At the time the two US Highways were created, WIS57 was left untouched between Abrams and Niagara. The next year, the M-57 designation was assigned to connect WIS57 to Quinnesec, and US8 was extended to follow US141 to US2 near Iron Mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis. In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E

5|$|When the Illinois and Michigan Canal {{opened in}} 1848, the landmass at Wolf Point was {{decreased}} by dredging {{to accommodate a}} turning basin for ships. In the autumn {{of the same year}} the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago's first railroad depot at Wolf Point, on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets. By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard; the Fulton Elevator, one of Chicago's earliest grain elevators, was built just {{to the north of the}} former tavern in 1852. Several blocks to the west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15, 1859. The Fulton Elevator survived this, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but was burned down on September 7, 1873. It was rebuilt in the same year, and another grain elevator, the St Paul Elevator, was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879. The Chicago, <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $400,000 ($ million today), but demolished them in 1906. Currently, the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{proposed}} {{an addition to}} the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state's third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US41 or US141 corridors, or a new corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US141 between <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Abrams into a freeway. The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road. The following year, {{an extension of the}} freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue. By 1965, the bypass of Sheboygan was opened; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year. Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to Grafton in Ozaukee County. The last section of US141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when I-94 was finished through downtown; at the same time, US141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{that became}} the Milwaukee Road began as the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Waukesha Railroad in Wisconsin, whose goal was to link the developing Lake Michigan port city of Milwaukee with the Mississippi River.

Its first line, all of , opened between <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>and</b> Wauwatosa, on November 20, 1850. Extensions followed to Waukesha in February 1851, Madison, and finally the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien in 1857.|$|E
