40|$|Social {{mechanisms}} are theoretical cogs and wheels that explain {{how and why}} one thing leads to another. Mechanisms can run from macro <b>to</b> <b>micro</b> (e. g., explaining the effects of organizational socialization practices or compensation systems on individual actions), <b>micro</b> <b>to</b> <b>micro</b> (e. g., social comparison processes), or <b>micro</b> <b>to</b> macro (e. g., how cognitively limited persons can be aggregated into a smart bureaucracy). Explanations in organization theory are typically rife with mechanisms, but they are often implicit. In this article, the authors focus on social mechanisms and explore challenges in pursuing a mechanisms approach. They argue that organization theories will be enriched if scholars expend more effort to understand and clarify the social mechanisms at play in their work and move beyond thinking about individual variables and the links between them to considering the bigger picture of action in its entirety.

40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical {{machining}} (ECM) is an anodic dissolution {{process of}} metal as anode ion by ion, and micro-ECM is a promising micromachining method at <b>micro</b> <b>to</b> meso-scale. Thus, a micro-ECM setup was developed <b>to</b> fabricate <b>micro</b> parts {{and explore the}} feasibility of micro-ECM at <b>micro</b> <b>to</b> meso-scale, including the design of high-frequency micro-energy pulse power supply. By using the detection unit of machining state and optical encoder, a closed loop control system for micro-ECM was developed. Under low concentration of passivating electrolyte, low machining voltage, micro rotating electrode and high-frequency short-pulse current, the machining gap {{can be reduced to}} about 10 µm. The influence factors of the additives and the rotation of micro electrode on micro ECM were analysed by experiments. A micro-hole about 30 µm in diameter was drilled by the rotating micro electrode...|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{models for}} the Bay of Fundy, Canada — site of the highest {{recorded}} modern tide — show that tidal amplification {{began in the early}} Holocene and by ca. 5000 BP the range was almost 80 % of the present range. Empirical data consisting of 146 sea-level index points and other observations appear to contradict model results. Aggregated relative sea-level data for Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin show that rapid tidal expansion began ca. 3400 BP. However, if we separate these two geographically separate data sets, evidence for this rapid late-Holocene tidal expansion is confined to Minas Basin. We explain this singularity by positing a barrier at the mouth of Minas Basin, at the Minas Passage, that delayed tidal expansion. With the rapid breakdown of this barrier and near-instantaneous tidal expansion, water temperature dropped, tidal currents and turbidity increased, and the form of the inner estuary was changed from lagoonal–mesotidal <b>to</b> <b>macrotidal.</b> We argue that the catastrophic breakdown of the barrier is related in the aboriginal legend of Glooscap, showing that aboriginal peoples observed the rapid environmental changes and preserved an oral record for 3400 years...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFour {{representative}} sectors encapsulating the morphological and hydrodynamic {{diversity of}} the French coast are used to illustrate the morphodynamics of beach/dune systems at various timescales. These beach/dune systems cover the four shoreline sectors composing the French coast, i. e., the southern North Sea, the English Channel, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean, and range from stormdominated short-fetch to swell settings, and from micro- <b>to</b> <b>macrotidal.</b> The short-term processes affecting the beach/dune systems are strongly hinged on wind incidence and storm intensity, while sediment supply, modulated by marine processes, notably storms and tides, and by the regional wind directions, constitutes the primary control on long-term patterns of development. Beach morphology, notably the presence of bar/berm-trough systems, and water levels attained during storms, constitute key elements {{in the process of}} sand supply to the dune systems, which vary from low, poorly developed forms in the Mediterranean, to the well developed, but largely presently stable to erosive systems characterising the other three sectors. The comparative study of these systems shows that there is no linear relationship between storm intensity and the rate of dune erosion (except on Vougot site, English Channel), because of the influence of various parameters, notably the antecedent beach state...|$|R
