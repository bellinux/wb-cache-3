40|$|The former Research Institute for Sustainable Energy (RISE) testing {{laboratory}} was originally a facility for measuring, monitoring and testing {{a variety of}} renewable energy systems. The RISE facility was independent of the School of Engineering and Energy, but has recently {{been taken over by}} the School as the Engineering and Energy Laboratory. Many of the systems associated with the laboratory have not been operated {{for a number of years}} and the condition of these systems, and the equipment that is associated with them, is not known. Personnel involved with the former RISE facility have since left Murdoch taking with them their knowledge of the facility. This project was primarily concerned with re-commissioning these systems and developing an operational knowledge of the SCADA based control system. Areas to be covered in particular were: •	connections to the grid from PV arrays and wind turbines •	PLC system and software •	inverters, solar array simulator, environmental chamber and other peripheral equipment •	power supplies such as the diesel generator, motor generator set and battery banks •	 3 phase permanently connected power monitors •	AC and DC electrical systems Initial inspections of the electrical systems showed that two key components of the facility were found to be defective and would need to be rectified if the facility was to function properly. These components were the diesel generator which provided electricity totally independent of the grid for testing purposes, and a fault on the PLC which was affecting the operation of the electrical systems. Also several main pieces of equipment had since been removed from the facility; most notably of these being the battery banks, main test inverter and the DC supply from the wind turbines located in what is now known as the Renewable Energy Outdoor Test Area (ROTA). Several pieces of equipment required for the operation of the diesel generator would also require attention such as the fuel tank and starting battery. Approval was granted for the alternator to be repaired and placed back into service. Approval was also granted for the purchase of a replacement analogue input card to rectify the fault with the PLC. In addition to this another requirement of the project was to develop a system so that the laboratory could be used as a training facility for future students. A procedure was developed so that an electrical system consisting of actual real components; a source, a transmission and distribution system and a load could be simulated. Software was also developed using National Instruments LabVIEW software to monitor and record various power parameters from the system. The system is referred to as the “Small Electrical Distribution System”. As an aside to this a program has been developed that monitors and records voltage, current and power that is being produced by the Real PV Array located on the roof of the Energy and Engineering Laboratory building. For someone who is unfamiliar with the setup of the electrical systems that make up the Energy and Engineering Laboratory a simplified block diagram of the <b>Main</b> AC <b>switchboard</b> has been produced. Schedules have been included of all socket inlets and outlets, main AC and communications cables and the <b>Main</b> AC <b>Switchboard</b> nomenclature. The diesel generator is nearly ready to be re-commissioned after approximately 5 years of non use. Procedures have been developed so that a user can configure the <b>Main</b> AC <b>switchboard</b> so that the “Small Electrical Distribution System” can be operated safely and measurements obtained and analysed. The main goal of the project was to get the diesel generator operating; therefore this report is focused on the equipment associated with the diesel generator. The equipment focused on was the diesel generator itself, the <b>Main</b> AC <b>Switchboard,</b> the Load Bank and the PLC system. Systems such as the <b>Main</b> DC <b>switchboard</b> and Solar Array Simulator were not covered in as much detail as they are not required for the “Small Electrical Distribution System”...|$|R

40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by fan-coil units in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the building drain which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and transformer vault, emergency generators and <b>main</b> <b>switchboards</b> are located at the east end of the basement. Panelboards are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls gain lateral stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.

In 1923, Southwestern Bell absorbed the local St. Louis telephone competitor, Kinloch Telephone, adding to pressure on the capacity of the building. These pressures resulted in the construction of the nearby Southwestern Bell Building in St. Louis between 1923 and 1926.|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model of}} a maritime electric power system has been developed on assignment from ABB Marine. The model is implemented in Matlab Simulink. The model development and implementation have been done with regards to practical limitations for real time simulations, with special emphasis on simulation speed and choice of numerical solving method. Real-time simulations of maritime electric power systems is of great usefulness in system engineering, both during the design phase and the commissioning phase. Simulations provide a means of testing the designed system before installation, and hence minimizes the risk of unexpected problems to occur during or after installation. In addition, the simulation model {{can be used for}} tuning system and controller parameters before physical testing at sea trials. This reduces both the work load at service engineers, and the risk of damaging equipment. The main components of a maritime electric power system on the generation side are prime movers, synchronous generators and the <b>main</b> <b>switchboard.</b> Each prime mover is connected to one synchronous generator through a shaft, and converts fuel energy to mechanical energy by rotating the shaft. This makes the connected generator able to produce electrical energy. Normally, four to eight generators are paralleled to two or four main switchboards, to provide centralized system voltage sources. The electrical energy from the switchboard is fed to various loads. A small part of total system load is constant with respect to power, current or voltage consumption, and is used for ''hotel purposes'' like lighting and heating. The major part of the total electric power is used for various motor loads, like powering of propulsion drives, thrusters, pumps and fans. Electricity is an energy form that cannot easily be stored in large quantities, and hence the energy production in the maritime electric power system must at all times meet the demand from the loads. Synchronous generators must operate at the same average speed to keep stable co-operation, and produce constant frequency, voltage and current. The voltage level should be equal across the switchboard, to prevent power from flowing between parallel generators instead of being fed to the loads. Especially motor loads will be affected by, and themselves affect, both system voltage and frequency. To ensure that the power demand is always met by corresponding generation, and that system frequency and voltage are kept within specified limits, many control functions must be included in the maritime electrical power system. Each prime mover has a speed controller, called governor, to provide correct frequency, and each generator has an Automatic Voltage Controller (AVR) to provide the correct terminal voltage level. In addition, system level control and protection functions must be provided to minimize the consequences of faults within the system. The main dynamical effects to influence the system frequency and voltage in a maritime electric power system are disturbances and load variations. In this assignment, the focus is load variations. Examples of extreme load variations are sudden increase or decrease in power consumption, tripping of generators which have lost synchronism with the system, and tripping of loads. This will usually happen as protection against major system faults. The system limitations with respect to load application are mainly determined by the prime movers, since these have upper limitations with respect to torque development. For stable load application within specified constraints, procedures for start-up and guidelines for load application rates given by the prime mover producer must be followed. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{life cycle}} cost {{comparison}} study between a newly built LNG ferry and a 21 year old conventional ferry {{was carried out in}} this study. The objective was to study the LNG vessel s cost effectiveness compared to an equivalent existing vessel of mature age. It has been assumed that both vessels are to be operating according to the LNG vessel s current production pattern at a specific ferry service. The study has a time span of 30 years. Another assumption is that both vessels are assumed to be procured from respectively the newbuilding market and the second-hand market. This study emphasises primarily vessel generated costs. The cost elements that are investigated are among other: capital costs, fuel costs, lube oil costs, maintenance costs, downtime costs, NOx emission costs and income due to scrapping. Costs such as port fees and management costs are not included. Due to the high level of uncertainty related to many of the cost elements, a sensitivity analysis is performed. A cost breakdown structure has been derived to identify the relevant cost elements which are to be studied. Data are gathered from the shipping company that owns the vessels. This is done by use of their databases and records. Documentations and specifications are also provided by the shipping company s suppliers. Estimations which lacked sufficient input data have been partly founded on expert opinions. It has been found that the total {{life cycle cost}}s of the conventional vessel are 12 % lower than the LNG vessel s. The most significant cost elements are identified to be the capital costs, fuel costs, maintenance costs, NOx emission costs and downtime costs. If an internal rate of return is applied, the LNG vessel s disadvantage when it comes to total life cycle costs will increase. This is due to the LNG vessel s high initial costs. The results show that the capital costs related to the procurement of the conventional vessel in real term value are only 8 % of the LNG vessel s capital cost. It has been found that the conventional vessel has 19 % lower energy consumption than the LNG vessel. Despite of this, it is estimated that the conventional vessel will have 9 % higher total fuel cost over the time period. The main {{reason for this is that}} the existing gap between the two energy prices is forecasted to increase over the time period. It is estimated that the LNG vessel has 9 % lower maintenance cost over the time period. One of the reasons for this is the expectation of reduced deterioration of the fuel supply system and other components such as engine nozzles and exhaust valves. The LNG vessel s total NOx emission costs are estimated to be only 15 % of the conventional vessel s, which is one of the most significant differences between the ferries. This is due to the LNG engine s ability to operate at very low NOx emission rates. An analysis regarding a measure that may reduce the LNG vessel s life cycle cost is also conducted. The vessel has installed a hybrid shaft generator system. The main engine is able to deliver power to the vessel s electricity grid by use of the shaft generator. Vice versa, the shaft generator is able to function as a motor and thus use electric power for propulsion. In other words, the shaft generator gives the vessel flexibility with respect to power consumption and power production. The measure is to replace the LNG vessel s shaft generator with a new unit which has sufficient capacity to supply all the <b>main</b> <b>switchboard</b> s consumers without having to run the vessel s standby generator. Then the main engine will alone be able to provide sufficient electricity power to the vessel s grid. This is assessed to enable savings of fuel, NOx tax and maintenance cost due to among other increased efficiency of electricity production. Data for this analysis regarding the current operation of the propulsions system is gathered from the LNG vessel s power management system. Information regarding the system s components is provided by the suppliers. It has been found that the yearly savings due to the reduced fuel, maintenance and NOx expenditures are in lower edge of 1 million NOK. This measure will reduce the vessel s NOx emission significantly. The measure therefore qualifies to a significant support from the Norwegian NOx fund, which may reduce the financial cost of the replacement to about 1 million NOK. Consequently, the payback time is about one year, which is a relatively short time period. However, it is important to underline that there is uncertainty related to these calculations and the inherent limitations which are associated with the measure...|$|E
