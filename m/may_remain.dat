5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they {{can usually be}} successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E

5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis. After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{within a}} wild area, no new {{permanent}} camp leases, mines, wells, roads, or rights-of-way for utility lines are allowed, although existing camps, roads, and rights-of-way <b>may</b> <b>remain.</b> Vehicles are allowed only on public roads; trails {{are limited to}} hikers, bicyclists, equestrians, and wheelchairs, and only primitive camping by backpackers is allowed. Quehanna has two paved roads open to vehicles, and is crossed by rights-of-way for three electrical power lines and two natural gas pipelines. It {{is one of the}} largest areas in Pennsylvania without permanent inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|During presidential elections, {{candidates}} may advertise on the Internet {{except on}} the eve of polling day and polling day itself. However, on those days, it remains legal for people to convey their own political views on a non-commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission, and election advertising <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> unaltered on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day.|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the Democratic Party, Maier {{was elected to the}} Wisconsin State Senate in 1950.

5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social {{group is the}} family, {{consisting}} of an adult female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which {{can be made up}} of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E
5|$|While Iridomyrmex ants {{are known}} for their aggression, some are more timid and shy; workers will run and hide if they are {{disturbed}} and avoid contact with other ant species. When nests are disturbed, workers will not attack; instead, they will relocate their brood and disregard other disturbances should they occur. Workers will hide in leaves and other vegetation, and in some cases, I. victorianus workers <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> still until any threat or danger subsides.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E

5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.|$|E

5|$|The 1869 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the earliest {{season in the}} Atlantic hurricane database in which {{there were at least}} ten tropical cyclones. Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> missing from the official database for each season in this era, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October.|$|E
5|$|The Master himself <b>may</b> <b>remain,</b> as may one ecclesiastic {{designated}} by the Congregations prior to the commencement of the election. The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope needs to have. After the speech concludes, the ecclesiastic leaves. Following the recitation of prayers, the Cardinal Dean asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain. After the clarification of the doubts, the election may commence. Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless. An ill cardinal may leave the conclave and later be readmitted; a cardinal who leaves for any reason other than illness may {{not return to the}} conclave.|$|E
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, <b>may</b> <b>remain</b> there for several days.|$|E
