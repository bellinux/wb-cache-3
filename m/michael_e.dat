5|$|Astronomer <b>Michael</b> <b>E.</b> Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and {{the dwarf}} planets , , and , thinks {{that it is}} the most scientifically {{important}} trans-Neptunian object found to date, because understanding its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer <b>Michael</b> <b>E.</b> Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by <b>Michael</b> <b>E.</b> DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina {{in his left}} eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E
5|$|The Americans were {{alarmed by}} the Japanese buildup, which was {{accurately}} tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by <b>Michael</b> <b>E.</b> DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} case was between plaintiff Brian Dowling and defendants Chicago Options Associates and <b>Michael</b> <b>E.</b> Davis, in which Dowling won a judgement of $817,830.45 from the defendants. After the court entered its judgement against him, Davis {{then tried to}} shield his assets from the plaintiff using his attorney-client relationship with {{the law firm of}} DLA Piper to assist him in buying a home in Florida. As part of this arrangement, Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper. At that time, as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis, the law firm was allocated $100,000 of those funds as its retainer; the funds were used to pay day-to-day company expenses.|$|E
