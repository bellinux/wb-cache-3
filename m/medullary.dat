5|$|<b>Medullary</b> bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of <b>medullary</b> bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the <b>medullary</b> bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of <b>medullary</b> tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a <b>medullary</b> tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, <b>medullary</b> tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that <b>medullary</b> tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of <b>medullary</b> tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs. This <b>medullary</b> bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A {{discovery}} of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of <b>medullary</b> bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found <b>medullary</b> bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of <b>medullary</b> tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of <b>medullary</b> tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). <b>Medullary</b> tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was <b>medullary</b> tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of <b>medullary</b> bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of <b>medullary</b> tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The <b>medullary</b> cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the <b>medullary</b> region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|From {{the bone}} {{features}} of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, {{it is estimated that}} Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the <b>medullary</b> cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, <b>medullary</b> cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the <b>medullary</b> excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the <b>medullary</b> excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} <b>medullary</b> {{respiratory}} centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in <b>medullary</b> thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, <b>medullary,</b> and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, <b>medullary</b> thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The <b>medullary</b> exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the <b>medullary</b> pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral <b>medullary</b> syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, <b>medullary</b> stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the <b>medullary</b> spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
5|$|EFS, {{a system}} {{found on the}} surface of bones, is thought to show a growth plateau which {{indicates}} that maximum body size and skeletal maturity is reached in an individual. Ampelosaurus has not been known to have EFS, found on most non-titanosaurian sauropods. Magyarosaurus, a closely related titanosaur, Lirainosaurus, a titanosaur related to saltasaurids, Alamosaurus, a saltasaurid, and Phuwiangosaurus, a very basal titanosaur, were also found to have lacked EFS. However, the basal macronarian Europasaurus has been shown to have had EFS, so it was likely just titanosaurians that did not have them. The outer edge of the bones, were EFS would have been found, was well-preserved, and still lacked any fossilized proof of them being present for Ampelosaurus. However, in the PLoS ONE study that found the lack of EFS, the larger specimens were not tested, so Ampelosaurus might have had EFS. This is characteristic of titanosaurs, as diplodocoids and basal macronarians seem to have EFS. A majority of all Ampelosaurus specimens have been found with secondary osteons placed densely in the inner regions of bones, and lightly in outer regions. The osteon orientation found in Ampelosaurus of osteons not only facing across the bone is not typical of Neosauropoda. Also, there is no <b>medullary</b> cavity in any bones of Ampelosaurus. Ampelosaurus seems to have had many ontogenetic stages in its life based on its bone histology.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{permeability}} of {{the inner}} <b>medullary</b> portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the <b>medullary</b> interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer <b>medullary</b> collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Increases {{blood flow}} through the vasa recta, which will wash the solutes (NaCl and urea) out of the <b>medullary</b> interstitium. The lower {{osmolarity}} of the <b>medullary</b> interstitium leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the line}} of dinosaurs that {{includes}} Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, the presence of <b>medullary</b> bone in both groups suggests that dinosaurs in general produced <b>medullary</b> tissue. On the other hand, crocodilians, which are dinosaurs' second closest extant relatives after birds, do not produce <b>medullary</b> bone. This tissue may have first appeared in ornithodires, the Triassic archosaur group from which dinosaurs are thought to have evolved.|$|E
25|$|Surgery and {{radiation}} therapy {{have been the}} major treatments for <b>medullary</b> thyroid carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Medullary</b> thyroid {{carcinoma}} {{may also}} produce a thyroid nodule and enlarged cervical lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|When laying eggs, female birds grow {{a special}} type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the marrow. This <b>medullary</b> bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells, and the birds that {{produced}} it absorb it when they have finished laying eggs. <b>Medullary</b> bone {{has been found in}} fossils of the theropods Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus and of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus.|$|E
25|$|When laying eggs, female birds grow {{a special}} type of bone in their limbs. This <b>medullary</b> bone forms as a calcium-rich layer inside the hard outer bone, {{and is used}} as a calcium source to make eggshells. The {{presence}} of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of a Tyrannosaurus rex specimen's hind limb suggested that T. rex used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed that the specimen is female. Further research has found <b>medullary</b> bone in the theropod Allosaurus and ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced <b>medullary</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial <b>medullary</b> thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary <b>medullary</b> thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary <b>medullary</b> thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all <b>medullary</b> thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>medullary</b> bone {{tissue in the}} thigh bone and shin bone of one specimen indicates that tenontosaurs used this tissue, today only found in birds that are laying eggs, in reproduction. Additionally, like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, two other dinosaurs known to have produced <b>medullary</b> bone, the tenontosaur individual was not at full adult size upon her death at 8years old. Because the theropod line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced <b>medullary</b> tissue and reached reproductive maturity before maximum size. A histological study showed that T. tilletti grew quickly early in life and during sub-adult ontogeny, but grew very slowly in the years approaching maturity, unlike other iguanodontians.|$|E
25|$|The tract {{is divided}} into two parts, the medial (or pontine) and lateral (or <b>medullary)</b> reticulospinal tracts (MRST and LRST).|$|E
25|$|Genetic causes include {{multiple}} endocrine neoplasia type 2 which markedly increases rates, {{particularly of}} the rarer <b>medullary</b> form of the disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Medullary</b> {{tumors are}} {{the third most}} common of all thyroid cancers. They make up about 3% of all thyroid cancer cases.|$|E

25|$|Depending on source, {{the overall}} 5-year {{survival}} rate for <b>medullary</b> thyroid cancer is 80%, 83% or 86%, and the 10-year survival rate is 75%.|$|E

25|$|<b>Medullary</b> thyroid cancer (MTC) {{is a form}} of thyroid {{carcinoma}} which originates {{from the}} parafollicular cells (C cells), which produce the hormone calcitonin.|$|E
25|$|The cycling of and {{excretion}} of urea by {{the kidneys}} {{is a vital}} part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner <b>medullary</b> collecting ducts of the nephrons, thus raising the osmolarity in the <b>medullary</b> interstitium surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.|$|E
