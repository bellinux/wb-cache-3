5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, {{although they are}} unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{cultivated}} {{the image}} of a Renaissance <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{authorities}} found a 53-year-old <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> 12-year-old daughter {{living in}} the park in a tarp-covered structure stocked with encyclopedias for homeschooling. They told police they had been {{living in the}} park for four years. My Abandonment, a novel by Peter Rock, tells a story built around the incident.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} me {{sufficient}} to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} critical praise, {{but was a}} {{box office}} disappointment. Nonetheless, Tucker: The <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream produced a spike in prices of Tucker Sedans, {{as well as a}} renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.|$|E

5|$|Tucker: The <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream was {{released}} in the United States on August 12, 1988, earning $3,709,562 in its opening weekend in 720 theaters. The film eventually grossed $19.65 million in US totals and was declared a box office bomb {{because it did not}} reimburse its $24 million production budget, despite positive reviews. Pocket Books published a novelization written by Robert Tine to coincide with the release of the film. Paramount Home Video released Tucker: The <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream on DVD in October 2000, which included audio commentary by Coppola, the 1948 promotional film Tucker: The Man and the Car (with optional commentary by Coppola), as well as a making-of featurette, Under the Hood: Making Tucker.|$|E
5|$|As KG 53 retreated out to sea, the German bombers dumped their bombs. Around 32 German bombs fell on {{the town}} of Shoeburyness. Two houses were {{destroyed}} and 20 damaged. One bomb landed on an Anderson Air Raid Shelter, killing a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife. Another landed on the railway signal box, killing the signalman. Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud flats and sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and went off at irregular intervals.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
25|$|The Israelites {{made their}} way up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> took the field against them at Edrei, but God told Moses not to fear, as God would deliver Og, <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> country to the Israelites to conquer as they had conquered Sihon. So God {{delivered}} King Og of Bashan, <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> 60 towns into the Israelites' hands, and they left no survivor. Og was so big that his iron bedstead was nine cubits long and four cubits wide.|$|R

5|$|De Stem des Bloeds (The Voice of Blood), {{also known}} as Njai Siti, is a 1930 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). It was {{directed}} by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt.

The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.|$|E
5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli's Nightmare reverberated with twentieth-century {{psychological}} theorists. In 1926, American writer Max Eastman paid a {{visit to}} Sigmund Freud and claimed to have seen a print of The Nightmare displayed next to Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson in Freud's Vienna apartment. Psychoanalyst and Freud biographer Ernest Jones chose another version of Fuseli's painting as the frontispiece of his book On the Nightmare (1931); however, neither Freud nor Jones mentioned these paintings in their writings about dreams. Carl Jung included The Nightmare and other Fuseli works in his <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Symbols (1964).|$|E

5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|In Braddock Heights, Maryland, a man mistakenly kills his wife, believing her, {{as well as}} {{the police}} who soon arrive, to all be someone else.

Mulder and partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit the <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> doctor, Dr. Stroman, in a psychiatric hospital and are told the man killed five people, believing them to all be the same person.|$|E
5|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Harvey pursued {{political interests}} and spent three spells as a Member of Parliament for Maldon and later Essex. During this period {{he was also}} knighted. However, Harvey was not a peaceable <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> life {{both in and out}} of the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with fellow officers and politicians. One such dispute, a consequence of the Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed in an official capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
