5000|$|Monja-yaki - a savoury pancake {{similar to}} okonomiyaki but much runnier and eaten {{directly}} off the grill using a <b>metal</b> <b>spatula,</b> from working-class districts of Tokyo. A nostalgic food item making a recent comeback.|$|E
50|$|The term 'palette knife' {{is common}} outside the USA, where the term 'frosting' is not {{generally}} used. However a palette knife as a culinary tool {{is not the}} same as a palette knife as used by artists. In Canada, the terms <b>metal</b> <b>spatula</b> and leveler are used also.|$|E
50|$|Silverware {{is not a}} part of {{traditional}} Bengali cookery. A flat <b>metal</b> <b>spatula,</b> khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for puréeing dal, the old wooden belun chaki (round pastry board and rolling pin), and the shil nora, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is a unitasker, there to grate coconuts.|$|E
50|$|Soft waxes are {{sometimes}} called sculpting waxes, and generally have a consistency resembling clay. Generally the techniques used in working soft waxes {{are similar to}} those used with clay and involve the use of wooden or <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas,</b> direct molding with the fingers and the like.|$|R
50|$|Local {{style in}} art and {{decoration}} included scrolls, simple curves, straight lines, and images of wild animals. Chavín sculpture is usually of white granite and black limestone. Carved stone mortars and pestles, conch-shell trumpets, bone tubes and <b>spatulas,</b> and <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas</b> and spoons were found decorated in Chavín style as were various textiles including tapestries. Pottery {{was found in a}} wide variety of forms, including bottles and bowls, decorated with a wider range of distinctive elements.|$|R
50|$|In Osaka (the {{largest city}} in the Kansai region), where this dish {{is said to have}} originated, okonomiyaki is {{prepared}} much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas</b> that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of women}} frying {{fish in a}} {{campground}} cooking area, ca. 1930. In the center, a woman can be seen holding a <b>metal</b> <b>spatula</b> while apparently flipping over a small fish. The fish are lying in a row on a stove next to the woman. The stove is located on a counter constructed out of brick and concrete. A second woman {{can be seen to}} the left holding up a fish hooked on a fork who seems to be placing it on a wooden board. Another concrete counter is visible behind her which seems to have a sink. The women are standing under a roofed open-air cooking area. Trees, vegetation, and cabins are visible downhill in the background...|$|E

5000|$|Heavy chrome plating, {{known as}} “hard chrome” from {{hexavalent}} baths, {{is the more}} common form used on commercial griddles. As plating thickness is increased, the surface finish of the underlying steel must be smoother, as the plating {{does not have a}} leveling effect. [...] Also because chrome plating is so hard (65 to 69 Rockwell scale), it is subject to damage if the underlying surface deforms during impacts from <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas</b> or pots and pans. Consequently, a quenched and tempered alloy steel such as A514 is frequently used for commercial cooking applications. That type of steel has three times the yield strength of common structural steel such as A36 which might otherwise be used for griddles.|$|R
40|$|While <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas</b> are damaged through {{everyday}} use and become discolored and corroded by chemical exposure, drinking straws are inexpensive and disposable, {{reducing the risk}} of cross contamination during laboratory experiments. Drinking straws are also useful because they {{come in a variety of}} sizes; narrow sample containers such as NMR and EPR tubes can easily be filled using small diameter coffee stirrers, while bulk material can be transferred using larger drinking straws. Several types of drinking straws and coffee stirrers were cut at various angles and the amount of material picked up in a single scoop was massed thirty times. Standard deviations of the thirty measurements per straw indicate that approximately the same amount of material will be scooped each time by the same operator...|$|R
50|$|Stir-fried {{ice cream}} {{is made with}} a milk base {{combined}} with various fresh ingredients and different toppings served with the ice cream. The main ingredients are the liquid base flavour which is commonly milk, or soy milk. Fresh fruit or other choices such as chocolate, green tea, or red beans are blended with the milk, while sometimes extract powder or syrups are used to create the flavour.To make stir-fried ice cream, the mixture is first poured into a −18 to −35 degree C metal pan. The ice cream masher uses two <b>metal</b> <b>spatulas</b> to mix and stir the mixture, which freezes and solidifies. The masher will add and grind different toppings like nuts, chocolate chips, and fruits to increase {{the texture of the}} ice cream. By continuously mixing and stirring in the cold pan, a scoop of stir-fried ice cream is created. The stir-fried process has to be quick and instant with only 5-10 seconds used to create the texture of ice cream. The ice cream can be piled for scooping or smoothed flat for scraping into curls and served in paper cups in Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|A {{process for}} bonding Teflon to {{chemically}} roughened aluminum was patented in France by Marc Gregoire in 1954. In 1956 he formed {{a company to}} market non-stick cookware under the [...] "Tefal" [...] brand name. The durability of the early coatings was poor, but improvements in manufacturing have made these products a kitchen standard. The surface is not as tough as metal {{and the use of}} <b>metal</b> utensils (e.g. <b>spatulas)</b> can permanently mar the coating and degrade its non-stick property.|$|R
