5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Jaidev {{is forced}} {{to decide whether to}} retaliate or leave Kolkata completely. He chooses to leave out of loyalty to Bhagavan and heads to Palasa, the village of Sandhya where Sandhya's brother Ashok (Subbaraju) is a valiant and kind-hearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu (Brahmanandam), and he solves the {{problems}} of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.|$|E
5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.|$|E

Based on the Livina, the X-Gear has black over fenders, sporty rugged bumpers, and roof rail which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a crossover. The Livina X-Gear in Indonesia is powered by 1.5-liter engine, while the Brazilian X-Gear is motored by 1.6-liter Renault engine.|$|R

60|$|A light {{broke in}} upon George. Now that the matter {{had been put}} before him, he could {{recollect}} a number of points that seemed to prove the fanner right. When cattle had been killed, their owners had been absent; horses had disappeared at a time which prevented the discovery of their loss from being promptly <b>made.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> as if the offenses {{could only have been}} committed with the connivance of somebody in the neighborhood who had supplied their perpetrators with information.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The backstory of {{the game}} is {{described}} in the fourth case, Turnabout Reminiscence. Ten years prior to the game's present, the secretariat of the Cohdopian Embassy was accused of murdering Cece Yew, a witness to a smuggling ring's connection to the embassy. Prosecutor Byrne Faraday and detective Tyrell Badd attempted to convict the secretariat, but he went free after key evidence was stolen. Feeling that the justice system was powerless to those who stand above the law, Faraday, Badd, and Yew's sister Calisto, started stealing corporate files detailing illegal or unethical activities and exposed them to the media, under the name Yatagarasu. Three years later, another murder occurred at the embassy. During the trial, in which Faraday was the prosecutor, the suspect, Mack Rell, claimed that he had been told by Faraday to commit the murder, and said that Faraday was the Yatagarasu. A recess was held to replace Faraday with another prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth; before court was reconvened, both Rell and Faraday were found dead. Edgeworth discovered that Calisto had murdered Faraday with help from Rell, then killed Rell and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like Faraday and Rell had killed each other. When confronted, Calisto says that she is Yatagarasu, not mentioning her two partners, and that she is part of the smuggling ring. Faraday's daughter Kay is comforted over Faraday's death by Edgeworth, Badd, and detective Gumshoe; she believes her father to be the true Yatagarasu, and vows to catch the fake.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiences}} of the Holocaust made racial discrimination unacceptable in Canada, {{at least from the}} government policy standpoint. Also, with the war aim of defeating Nazism in terms of discrimination, Canada's racial legislation <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> hypocritical. Moreover, with Chinese Canadian contributions in World War II, and also because the anti-Chinese legislation violated the UN Charter, the government of Canada repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act and gave Chinese Canadians full citizenship rights in 1947. However, Chinese immigration was limited only to the spouse of a Chinese who had Canadian citizenship and his dependants. However, after the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949 and its support for the communist North in the Korean War, Chinese in Canada faced another wave of resentment, as Chinese were viewed as communist agents from the PRC.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960 U-2 {{incident}} he and {{his flight}} leader, deputy squadron commander Captain Boris Ayvazyan were vectored to intercept Gary Powers' U-2 with their MiG-19 fighters. On their way to interception, the U-2 was shot down by S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missiles, but large pieces of the downed aircraft <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like its flight was continuing, so additional S-75 missiles were fired. However, the MiGs' IFF transponders were not yet switched to the new May codes because of the 1 May holiday and consequently, Safronov's plane {{was identified as a}} foe by the missile operators and another salvo was launched. His aircraft took a direct hit from one of the S-75 missiles intended for the U-2 and was destroyed. He was able to eject, but died from his injuries; Powers saw a parachute open after leaving the U-2. Safronov was buried at the Yegoshikha Cemetery in Perm.|$|E
25|$|For his {{entrance}} {{prior to}} the main event Myzteziz was lowered from the ceiling wearing a harness, holding a pose {{similar to that of}} Ethan Hunt (portrayed by Tom Cruise) from the first Mission Impossible movie. Once he landed on the ground and was unhooked he revealed a half black/half white version of his normal wrestling gear, alluding to comments made {{prior to the}} show that he may or may not work as a tecnico for the match. Initially Rey Mysterio Jr. took control of the match, much to Myzteziz's frustration, with Myzteziz only gaining control of the match by using punches, kicks and other rudo tactics. This drew boos from the crowd as they were vocally behind Rey Mysterio Jr. At one point during the match Myzteziz slammed Rey Mysterio Jr. onto of the English Language commentator's table, and at another point he suplexed Mysterio Jr. out of the ring, through a table. At one point Rey Mysterio Jr. threw Myzteziz into one of the ring posts, making it look like Myzteziz hit his head on the metal. While the cameras were focusing on Rey Mysterio Jr. Myzteziz <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the impact had cut his forehead open as blood (or a similar red substance) covered the white portion of his mask. Once the two wrestlers returned to the ring Rey Mysterio Jr. started to tear at Myzteziz's mask, tearing it open around the eye holds. Late in the match Rey Mysterio Jr. managed to apply Myzteziz's finishing hold, the La Mistica Fujiwara armbar, on Myzteziz but did not gain a submission from the move. Later on Mysterio Jr. managed to apply La Mistica once more, this time with Myzteziz being forced to tap out. As Mysterio Jr. celebrated on the floor Averno, Pentagón Jr. and Joe Lider ran to the ring to attack Myzteziz while he was down. When Rey Mysterio Jr. noticed the attack he entered the ring and helped Myzteziz fight off the rudo trios. When Mysterio Jr. offered a handshake Myzteziz spit a liquid in Mysterio's eyes and then declared that he did not care about the fans or Rey Mysterio Jr. He later challenged Mysterio to put his mask on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas match. As the show went off the air Myzteziz declined to join Konnan's La Sociedad, stating he was on his own.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the graphics, GameSpot, Allgame and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{appreciated}} {{the level of}} details and effects used in the different stages, {{as well as the}} large size of the bosses.

500|$|Despite its criticisms, [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{received}} some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on the}} episode, writing: [...] "I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as [...] "fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{very first}} scene {{was shot in}} a small tank {{across the street from}} North Shore Studios in Vancouver. Wide-angle lenses were used to film the scene as the actors did not {{actually}} have much room for swimming. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the actors are actually covering some ground, while in reality they only swam [...] On the set of the following scene in which Fox Mulder reaches the shore, it was raining and very cold. Manners commented that the acting crew was more tired than usual because of it—during filming, Duchovny struggled to run from the actors playing his pursuers, but had previously been able to run from two horses when filming the episode [...] "Tunguska".|$|E
500|$|Several props {{included}} large {{screens and}} LED lights that {{were placed in}} a three-wall room, omitting the front wall in order to shoot the video. Suzuki explained that the scenery is not in fact [...] "a night club", as she believed that it has [...] "no story" [...] and only works by the [...] "feel-good" [...] vibe of the song itself; however, she did note how the lights <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like one. Nakata made a cameo appearance in the visual, appearing in the static televisions that {{were placed in the}} room. Length-wise, it took Akihisa one day to complete filming, with the entire crew and Suzuki spending majority of the entire day, and finishing at approximately 3am.|$|E

500|$|Machkovech {{said that}} the game looks [...] "phenomenal", and that its [...] "beautiful, easily {{discernible}} sprites" [...] and 60-frames-per-second animations <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> modern despite the 320×240 resolution. He particularly enjoyed the game's color palette, saying that it made AM2R feel like a completely new game. Furniss called the game [...] "gorgeous", praising the colors and the increased graphical detail. Alec Meer at Rock, Paper, Shotgun {{said that the}} game looked lovely, {{and that it was}} a large improvement over the Game Boy version's green screen. Jeffrey Matulef, writing for Eurogamer, found it impressive how closely the game resembled Super Metroid visually. Fahey noted the soundtrack in particular as being of high quality, and Lopes called the music [...] "fantastic".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{generally}} well received, its content drew criticism from fans, who felt the overall effect diminished the significance of Harrison's solo career. In the 1977 edition of their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler summed up the implication: [...] "George's 'Best Of'. Half Beatle, half Harisongs. But {{will there be a}} Volume II?" [...] Nicholas Schaffner observed a couple of minor positives on this [...] "half-baked" [...] collection: [...] "The Best of George Harrison does confirm that George's big production numbers from All Things Must Pass more than hold their own alongside the seven featured Beatles tunes... And the album is undeniably better looking than Rock 'n' Roll Music." [...] Bob Woffinden similarly found that Harrison's solo recordings matched the standard of the Beatles' tracks while noting that [...] "Capitol's half-and-half arrangement... <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as though {{he was the only one}} of the four [...] with insufficient clout to warrant a 'Greatest Hits' [...] entirely of his own work." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the end of}} term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, {{and begins}} seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to him}} {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E

50|$|Brown was the first-choice keeper for Hereford in Conference matches (but was {{not allowed}} by Chester to play in cup games) and was an {{integral}} part of the best defence in the Conference that season, conceding just 30 goals.

With all three substitutions <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> for a moment as if he would be unable to continue, but after several minutes he recovered and even made a good save in the dying minutes to keep Hereford 3-2 up.

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1847, Pierce was {{promoted}} to brigadier general, and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, {{in time for the}} Battle of Contreras. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury. The incident <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, [...] "General Pierce is a damned coward." [...] Pierce returned for the following day's action, but again injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men, {{and by the time he}} caught up, the battle had mostly been won.|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{witnessed}} the first explosion, Able, {{from the deck}} of the task force flagship, the command ship [...] An airburst like the Hiroshima blast, it was unimpressive, and even Parsons thought that it must have been smaller than the Hiroshima bomb. It failed to sink the target ship, the battleship , mainly because it missed it by a considerable distance. This made it difficult to assess the amount of damage caused, which was the objective of the exercise. Blandy then announced that the next test, Baker, would occur in just three weeks. This meant that Parsons had to carry out the evaluation of Able simultaneously with the preparations for Baker. This time he assisted with the final preparations on [...] before heading back to seaplane tender [...] for the test. The underwater Baker explosion was no larger than Able, but the dome and water column <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> far more spectacular. The real problem was the radioactive fallout, as Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's medical advisor, had predicted. The target ships proved impossible to decontaminate and, lacking targets, the test series had to be called off. For his part in Operation Crossroads, Parsons was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
