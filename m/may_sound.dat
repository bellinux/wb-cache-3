5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E
25|$|The letter S {{occurring}} among vowels <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> /z/.|$|E
25|$|Foreign terms {{may take}} native plural forms, {{especially}} when the user is addressing an audience familiar with the language. In such cases, the conventionally formed English plural <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> awkward or be confusing.|$|E
5000|$|Distortions: Sounds {{are changed}} {{slightly}} {{so that the}} intended <b>sound</b> <b>may</b> be recognized but sounds [...] "wrong," [...] or <b>may</b> not <b>sound</b> like any sound in the language.|$|R
50|$|Some notes <b>may</b> be <b>sounded</b> at {{more than}} one {{position}}; for example, D4 <b>may</b> be <b>sounded</b> either in position 1 or 4. As a result, trombonists often spend time studying a part {{to determine how to}} approach a particular phrase.|$|R

25|$|Also, p and f are {{sometimes}} pronounced somewhat similarly among speakers of Malay descent. For example, the two Malay names 'Fazlin' and 'Pazlin' <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> almost identical when spoken by Malays, whereas this confusion would not arise when spoken by a British Speaker.|$|E
25|$|If you {{are doing}} a really convincing job, then {{you should be able}} to put a bent key on the table and comment, ‘Look, it is still bending’, and have your spectators really believe that it is. This <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> the height of boldness; however, the effect is astounding – and {{combined}} with suggestion, it does work.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of this}} {{construction}} is particularly common with compound subjects, as in, e.g., Eu e ela, nós fomos passear ("She and I, we went for a walk"). This happens because the traditional syntax (Eu e ela fomos passear) places a plural-conjugated verb immediately following an argument in the singular, which <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> unnatural to Brazilian ears. The redundant pronoun thus clarifies the verbal inflection in such cases.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{previously}} extravagant Anthems: The Tour (2011), this tour {{is presented as}} a series of intimate and acoustic shows performed under candlelight where the pair perform to raise awareness of their work for the Born Free Foundation. Receiving positive reviews, the tour was complimented by critics for the pairing of <b>May's</b> <b>sound</b> and Ellis' vocals.|$|R

25|$|An {{account of}} profits is another {{potential}} remedy. It is usually used where the {{breach of duty}} was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably {{by virtue of the}} fiduciary position, so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> like a constructive trust at first, but it is not.|$|E
25|$|Tagalog profanity {{can refer}} {{to a wide range}} of offensive, blasphemous, and taboo words or {{expressions}} in the Tagalog language of the Philippines. Due to Filipino culture, expressions which <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> benign when translated back to English can cause great offense; while some expressions English speakers might take great offense to can sound benign to a Tagalog speaker. Filipino, the national language of the Philippines, is the standard register of Tagalog, so as such the terms Filipino profanity and Filipino swear words are sometimes also employed.|$|E
25|$|The {{survivors}} {{communicate by}} voice commands that are accessed by quick menus, and some <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> off automatically when performing actions such as reloading or spotting infected. Over 1,000 unique {{lines have been}} recorded for each survivor. Additional communication of player actions is conveyed through character lights. Also, weapon-mounted flashlights and muzzle flashes help the players in determining whether their companions are shooting, performing melee attacks, reloading or moving. Due to control issues {{and the likelihood of}} players using a headset, the Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead omits the quick phrases feature.|$|E

25|$|In music, {{even if the}} {{opposition}} often is founded on the preceding, objective distinction, it more often is subjective, conventional, cultural, and style- and/or period-dependent. Dissonance can then {{be defined as a}} combination of sounds that does not belong to the style under consideration; in recent music, what is considered stylistically dissonant may even correspond to what is said to be consonant {{in the context of a}}coustics (e.g. a major triad in 20th century atonal music). A major second (e.g. the notes C and D played simultaneously) would be considered dissonant if it occurred in a J.S. Bach prelude from the 1700s; however, the same interval <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> consonant in the context of a Claude Debussy piece from the early 1900s or an atonal contemporary piece.|$|E
25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote: Attractive as this argument <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E
25|$|The entire landmass of Southern California was {{subdivided}} {{according to}} the San Bernardino Meridian, which was first plotted {{as part of the}} Public Land Survey System in November 1852, by Col. Henry Washington. Base Line road, a major thoroughfare, today runs from Highland to San Dimas, intermittently along the absolute baseline coordinates plotted by Col. Washington. San Bernardino County was first formed out of parts of Los Angeles County on April 26, 1853. While the partition once included what is today most of Riverside County, the region is not as monolithic as it <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> Rivalries between Colton, Redlands, Riverside and San Bernardino over the location of the county seat in the 1890s caused each of them to form their own civic communities, each with their own newspapers. On August 14, 1893, the state Senate allowed Riverside County to form out of land previously in San Bernardino and San Diego counties, after rejecting a bill for Pomona to split from L.A. County and become the seat of what would have been called San Antonio County.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics {{underwent}} many changes, {{in order}} to find the right level of vulgarity. The initial version was much more “genteel,” while later versions included references to ‘turtleheads’ and other slang for feces; as was the line “It <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> gross, it <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> crass, but we need to see what comes out of your ass”; which was changed to “It <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> gross, you may say shush, but we need to see what comes out of your tush.” ...|$|E
