The study of high-energy ion irradiations, such as <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volt</b> protons, is also important due to the potential use of graphene devices in space applications, specially solar cells [32]. Though the irradiation-induced damage is very common, it has been demonstrated that swift heavy ions (SHI), with carefully selected ranges of fluence, {{can also be used}} for annealing of defects in graphene. We have earlier observed the annealing/ordering effect in fullerenes and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) at lower fluences after irradiation with 200 -MeV Au, 60 -MeV Ni and 55 -MeV C ions [33, 34].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this article, we {{describe}} a clinical mega-voltage cone-beam computed tomography (MV CBCT) system, present the image acquisition and patient setup procedure, discuss the positioning accuracy and image quality, and illustrate its potential use for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) through selected clinical examples. The MV CBCT system {{consists of a}} standard linear accelerator equipped with an amorphous-silicon flat panel electronic portal-imaging device adapted for <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volt</b> (MeV) photons. An integrated computer workspace provides automated acquisition of projection images, image reconstruction, CT to CBCT image registration, and couch shift calculation. The system demonstrates submillimeter localization precision and sufficient soft-tissue resolution to visualize structures such as the prostate. In our clinic, we have used the MV CBCT system to detect nonrigid spinal cord distortions, monitor tumor growth and shrinkage, and locate and position stationary tumors in the lung. MV CBCT has also greatly improved the delineation of structures in CT images that suffer from metal artifacts. MV CBCT has undergone significant development {{in the last few}} years. Current image quality has already proven sufficient for many IGRT applications. Moreover, we expect the range of clinical applications for MV CBCT to grow as imaging technology continues to improve. © 2006 America...|$|E

The photon spectrum of pulsed emission between 100 <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volts</b> and 400 GeV is described by a broken power law that is statistically preferred over a power law with an exponential cutoff.

40|$|The {{well-known}} Crab Nebula is at {{the center}} of the SN 1054 supernova remnant. It consists of a rotationally powered pulsar interacting with a surrounding nebula through a relativistic particle wind.

The flare luminosity and short time scale favor an origin near the pulsar, and we discuss Chandra Observatory x-ray and Hubble Space Telescope optical follow-up observations of the nebula.

40|$|Ultrashort light pulses are {{powerful}} tools for time-resolved studies of molecular and atomic dynamics 1. They {{arise in the}} visible and infrared range from femtosecond lasers 2, and at shorter wavelengths, in the ultraviolet and X-ray range, from synchrotron sources 3 and free-electron lasers 4. Recent progress in laser wakefield accelerators has resulted in electron beams with energies from tens of <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volts</b> (refs 5, 6, 7) to more than 1 GeV within a few centimetres 8, with pulse durations predicted to be several femtoseconds 9. The enormous progress in improving beam quality and stability 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 makes them serious candidates for driving {{the next generation of}} ultracompact light sources 11. Here, we demonstrate the first successful combination of a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator, producing 55 - 75 MeV electron bunches, with an undulator to generate visible synchrotron radiation.

40|$|A {{multilayer}} luminescent design {{concept is}} presented to develop energy-sensitive radiation-beam monitors {{on the basis of}} colorimetric analysis. Each luminescent layer within the stack consists of rare-earth-doped transparent oxides of optical quality and a characteristic luminescent emission under excitation with electron or ion beams. For a given type of particle beam (electron, protons, α particles, etc.), its penetration depth and therefore its energy loss at a particular buried layer within the multilayer stack depend on the energy of the initial beam. The intensity of the luminescent response of each layer is proportional to the energy deposited by the radiation beam within the layer, so characteristic color emission will be achieved if different phosphors are considered in the layers of the luminescent stack. Phosphor doping, emission efficiency, layer thickness, and multilayer structure design are key parameters relevant to achieving a broad colorimetric response. Two case examples are designed and fabricated to illustrate the capabilities of these new types of detector to evaluate the kinetic energy of either electron beams of a few kilo-electron volts or α particles of a few <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volts.</b> The authors thank financial support from TEP- 8067 (Junta de Andalucia/FEDER, UE), MAT 2013 - 40852 -R (MINECO/FEDER, UE) and MAT 2016 - 79866 -R (AEI/FEDER, UE) projects.

50|$|The strong {{electromagnetic}} pulse (EMP) that results has several components. In {{the first few}} tens of nanoseconds, about {{a tenth of a}} percent of the weapon yield appears as powerful gamma rays with energies of one to three <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volts</b> (MeV, a unit of energy). The gamma rays penetrate the atmosphere and collide with air molecules, depositing their energy to produce huge quantities of positive ions and recoil electrons (also known as Compton electrons). The impacts create MeV-energy Compton electrons that then accelerate and spiral along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The resulting transient electric fields and currents that arise generate electromagnetic emissions in the radio frequency range of 15 to 250 megahertz (MHz, or fifteen million to 250 million cycles per second). This high-altitude EMP occurs between 30 and 50 kilometers (18 and 31 miles) above the Earth's surface.The potential as an anti-satellite weapon became apparent in August 1958 during Hardtack Teak. The EMP observed at the Apia Observatory at Samoa was four times more powerful than any created by solar storms, while in July 1962 the Starfish Prime test damaged electronics in Honolulu and New Zealand (approximately 1,300 kilometers away), fused 300 street lights on Oahu (Hawaii), set off about 100 burglar alarms, and caused the failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai, which cut off the sturdy telephone system from the other Hawaiian islands. The radius for an effective satellite kill for the various prompt radiations produced by such a nuclear weapon in space was determined to be roughly 80 km. Further testing to this end was carried out, and embodied in a Department of Defense program, Program 437.|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic {{investigations}} into disease {{can be divided}} into the different modes of analysis and sample forms. Modern instruments are capable of analysing biological samples, cells and tissues. Software can be integrated into the data analysis, providing a means to extract hidden information. Spectroscopic techniques can collect information on multiple analytes, resulting in a wealth of information collected {{in a short period of}} time. Therefore spectroscopic techniques were exploited to investigate disease, with a range of analysis techniques. A spectral, humidity artefact was observed. As these studies were undertaken to explore potential diagnostic applications, an investigation into the cause of the artefact was undertaken. Further studies into artefacts were initiated after the observation of creatine deposits on thin tissue sections of murine brains. The mechanisms behind the formation of these deposits were investigated. The diagnostic applications of spectroscopy of human blood fractions were investigated. A proof-of-concept study was applied to a number of diseases with promising preliminary results. The very first spectroscopic investigation of microparticles (MPs) was undertaken. MPs are sub-micron vesicles that bud from the surface of cells and platelets and are released carrying surface proteins and receptors and a cargo of DNA/RNA. In a murine model of cerebral malaria (CM), if mice are treated with an anti-malarial during the early stages of the infection, they are protected from CM. The mechanism behind this protection was investigated via FTIR imaging of mice brain samples. Particle-induced X-ray spectroscopy routinely uses protons as a beam particle, with an energy of three <b>mega-electron</b> <b>volts.</b> The use of heavier particles is possible, with the potential to increase the yields that are achievable. This effect was applied to investigate the changes that occur when analysing thin brain sections. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.
