25|$|Southwestern Bell {{was one of}} the {{companies}} created by the breakup of AT Corp. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia <b>mobile</b> <b>business</b> and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015).|$|E

25|$|One factor fueling General American's {{popularity}} was {{the major}} demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic, which, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly educated Americans should not possess a regional accent. A General American sound is then the result of both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of General American speech) following the region's rapid industrialization after the American Civil War, when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly <b>mobile</b> <b>business</b> elite, who travelled {{around the country in}} the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accent system. A third possible factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces unconsciously repelled socially-conscious Americans away from pronunciations associated with African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant communities (for example, American Jews) in the coastal Northeast, instead settling upon or favoring pronunciations more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, Midwest, and western New England.|$|E
