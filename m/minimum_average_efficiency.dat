5000|$|Spectrolab is a {{manufacturer}} of space solar cells and panels headquartered in Sylmar, California. It is a subsidiary of The Boeing Company, and part of Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Spectrolab was founded in 1956 by Alfred E. Mann, a billionaire American entrepreneur and philanthropist. Spectrolab was originally a division of Textron. Spectrolab was acquired by Hughes Aircraft Company in 1975 and became a subsidiary of Hughes until its sale to Boeing in 2000. The company states its [...] "NeXt Triple Junction" [...] high efficiency solar cells have a <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 29.5% to AIAA-2005-111 and AIAA-2005-112 requirements. In 2006 testing at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory demonstrated an efficiency of 40.7% using triple-junction solar cells developed by Spectrolab under concentration.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the Mexican banking industry from 2000 to 2009. Using Data Envelopment Analysis and the production approach (where the number of loans and deposit accounts are considered outputs) I estimate efficiency scores for every state in Mexico. Results show that efficiency scores are on average 0. 83 for the whole sample, with a <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> <b>efficiency</b> score of 0. 49. Central states, Mexico, Hidalgo and Michoacán specifically, are on average more efficient than some northeastern and southwestern states. There is high variation in efficiency scores implying high heterogeneity in financial access across Mexico. Furthermore, by identifying two subsamples, high remittance-recipient states and low remittance-recipient states, I find statistically significant differences between efficiency scores. High remittance-recipient states are statistically more efficient than low remittance-recipient states for every year in the sample. JEL classification: F 34, G...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} {{the widespread use}} of GaAs solar cells in space is the cost and weight of the GaAs substrate. In order to overcome these problems, Spectrolab is pursuing thin cell technologies encompassing both liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) GaAs on GaAs and MOCVD GaAs on Ge cells. Spectrolab's experience in the manufacture of 4 to 6 mil 2 cm x 4 cm GaAs cells on a LPE production line is discussed. By thinning the cells at a late state of processing, production yields comparable to 12 mil cells have been achieved. Data are presented showing that GaAs cells can be welded without degradation and have achieved <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 18 percent AM 0, 28 C with efficiencies up to 20 percent. Spectrolab, in conjunction with Spire Corporation has also been pursuing GaAs on Ge cell technology in support of larger area lighter weight power systems. Data are presented showing that individual 2 cm x 2 cm, 8 mil cell efficiencies up to 21. 7 percent have been achieved. Efficiencies up to 24 percent AM 0 will be possible by optimizing the GaAs/Ge interface. Cells have been welded without degradation using silver interconnects and have been laid down on an aluminum honeycomb/graphite facesheet substrate to produce a small coupon. The efficiency was 18. 1 percent at AM 0, 28 C...|$|R

5000|$|According to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy {{standard}} (CAFE) regulation, {{which was}} enacted in 1975, every seller of automobiles in the US had to achieve by 1985 a <b>minimum</b> sales-weighted <b>average</b> fuel <b>efficiency</b> of 27.5 {{miles per gallon}} (MPG). This standard had to be achieved for domestically produced and imported cars separately. Failure to meet the prescribed standard incurred a penalty of $5 per car per 1/10 of a gallon that the {{corporate average fuel economy}} fell below the standard. The first idea about the environmental impact of the CAFE regulation can be obtained by examining its effects on the <b>average</b> fuel <b>efficiency</b> of domestic and foreign firms; these effects are largest for the domestic production of US manufacturers, whose corporate <b>average</b> fuel <b>efficiency</b> would be lower by 1.2 MPG in the absence of CAFE standards. CAFE standards also lead to approximately [...] fuel consumption savings per year. Contrary to the CAFE standards, gasoline taxes affect not only new but also used cars, so that {{there is no reason to}} expect any substitution towards less fuel efficient used cars when taxes are raised. Small tax increases are insufficient to induce fuel cost savings of the same order of magnitude as CAFE.|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, bounds on {{the average}} depth and the average {{weighted}} depth of decision trees are considered. Similar problems are studied in search theory [1], coding theory [77], design and analysis of algorithms (e. g., sorting) [38]. For any diagnostic problem, the <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> depth of decision tree is bounded from below by the entropy of probability distribution (with a multiplier 1 /log 2 k for a problem over a k-valued information system). Among diagnostic problems, the problems with {{a complete set of}} attributes have the lowest <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> depth of decision trees (e. g, the problem of building optimal prefix code [1] and a blood test study in assumption that exactly one patient is ill [23]). For such problems, the <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> depth of decision tree exceeds the lower bound by at most one. The <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> depth reaches the maximum on the problems in which each attribute is "indispensable" [44] (e. g., a diagnostic problem with n attributes and kn pairwise different rows in the decision table and the problem of implementing the modulo 2 summation function). These problems have the <b>minimum</b> <b>average</b> depth of decision tree equal to the number of attributes in the problem description. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011...|$|R
