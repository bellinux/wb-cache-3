25|$|The preparatory attentional {{and memory}} (PAM) theory proposes {{two types of}} {{processes}} involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, {{similar to those used}} when maintaining attention, because {{there is a need for}} the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> is needed to be able to remember to perform this action at the correct condition or time.|$|E

40|$|<b>Monitoring</b> of cross-organizational <b>processes</b> {{requires}} the definition {{and implementation of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>processes</b> that can deliver the right information to the right party in the collaboration. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>processes</b> should account for the temporal and aggregation dependencies among the monitoring information made available by the set of collaborating parties. We {{solve the problem of}} designing <b>monitoring</b> <b>processes</b> in collaborative settings using Product-Based Workflow Design (PBWD). We first discuss a methodology to apply PBWD in this context and then propose an architecture to implement the methodology using a serviceoriented approach...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} receive notifications, an {{application}} subscribes at the Monitor Host to receive SNMP traps (notifyTrap) with process state information. The application will be notified whenever the Monitor detects a change {{of the state of}} the <b>monitored</b> <b>process.</b> Object statusChange is also updated to store 0, if the <b>monitored</b> <b>process</b> is correct, and 1 otherwise. Note that besides receiving traps (alarms) the application can at any time check the state of any <b>monitored</b> <b>process</b> by querying the corresponding MIB object.|$|R
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} involves {{monitoring the}} tumor {{for signs of}} growth or the appearance of symptoms. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory that}} has been used to explain the {{mechanisms}} of prospective memory is the multi-process model proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005). This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval.|$|E

[...] "Together we must stop the practices that feed corruption or undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of national institutions." [...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it is being spent, and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems – what the conference called a roadmap of accountability. Kabul must also demonstrate efforts to improve governance and finance management, and safeguard the democratic process, {{rule of law and}} human rights – especially those of women. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the need for reform to safeguard changes achieved in Afghanistan. [...] "That must include fighting corruption, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, increasing access to economic opportunity for all Afghans, especially for women," [...] she said. A follow-up conference will be hold in Britain in 2014. The meeting in Britain in 2014 will check progress toward [...] "mutual accountability" [...] and a review and <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> to assure that development aid is not diverted by corrupt officials or mismanaged – both of which have been major hurdles in putting aid projects into practice thus far.|$|E

50|$|Ironic process theory {{proposed}} {{two opposing}} mechanisms (a dual process theory). First, monitoring processes unconsciously and automatically monitor for occurrences of the unwanted thought, calling upon the second—conscious operating processes—if the thought occurs. This theory explains {{the effects of}} increased cognitive load by emphasizing that where there is cognitive effort, the <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> may supplant the conscious process, also suggesting {{that in order for}} thought suppression to be effective, a balance between the two processes must exist, with the cognitive demand not being so great as to let the <b>monitoring</b> <b>process</b> interrupt the conscious processes.
