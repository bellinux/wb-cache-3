That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free <b>market</b> <b>regime</b> designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom."

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} was to analyze {{differences}} in labour market performance in various labour <b>market</b> <b>regimes</b> during and after the latest recession. Different labour <b>market</b> <b>regimes</b> had specific paths of adjustments to recessional macroeconomic shocks, which can be related to underlying labour market institutions, as well as other institutional characteristics. Reaction of European labour markets on economic crisis 2008 ‐ 2009 varied across the Member States. Classification of countries was primarily based on principal component analysis performed in order to capture two main labour market features: flexibility and security. These features are a basis of the “flexicurity” concept and they are mainly determined by labour market institutions. Key determinants of flexibility and security balance in the labour market are: employment protection legislation, unemployment benefits system and active labour market policies. Within the labour <b>market</b> <b>regimes</b> results have been rather uneven, but we might say that Nordic and Continental regime tend to have had better labour market performances compared to Anglo‐Saxon and Mediterranean.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to search for hedges and safe havens within three {{instrument}} classes: assets (represented by the S&P 500 index), gold and oil prices, and dollar exchange rates. Weekly series of returns of all the instruments from the period January 1995 – June 2015 are analysed. The study is based on conditional correlations between the instruments in different <b>market</b> <b>regimes</b> obtained {{with the use of}} copula-DCC GARCH models. It is assumed that different <b>market</b> <b>regimes</b> will be identified by statistical clustering techniques; however, only conditional variances (without conditional covariances) will be taken into account. The reason for this assumption is connected with the fact that variances can be understood as market risk, and, as such, are a good indicator of market conditions. A considerable advantage of such an approach is the lack of need to determine the number of <b>market</b> <b>regimes,</b> as it is established by clustering quality measures. What is more, the methodology used in the paper makes it possible to treat the relations between instruments symmetrically. The results obtained in the study reveal that only dollar exchange rates can be treated as a (strong) hedge and a (strong) safe haven for other instruments, while gold and oil are a hedge for assets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the competitive effect of two distinct marketing options for renewable electricity. I consider (1) a <b>marketing</b> <b>regime</b> that requires an {{independent system operator}} to transfer all available renewable electricity at zero prices to the spot market, and (2) a <b>marketing</b> <b>regime</b> where renewable plant operators directly sell their electricity on the spot or forward market. Similar marketing options coexist in Germany. I find that the dumping of renewable electricity at zero prices on the spot market is more beneficial for competition but bares the risk of negative prices at low levels of demand. Under the direct selling of renewable electricity, negative prices will not occur. However, selling renewable electricity directly can lead to substantially higher prices compared to dumping. © 2013 IEEE. SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
