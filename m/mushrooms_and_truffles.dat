5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few <b>mushrooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>truffles,</b> unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E

5000|$|In 1903, {{the renowned}} chef Auguste Escoffier noted that dishes labeled aux fines herbes were {{sometimes}} being made with parsley alone.

40|$|Abstract: The {{roots of}} nearly all land plants form {{mycorrhizal}} symbioses with specialized soil fungi. The mycorrhizal fungi serve as extensions of plant roots, taking up nutrients and water and transferring them to the roots. In return, the mycorrhizal fungi receive their primary energy source {{in the form of}} simple sugars from plant photosynthates translocated to the roots. Sequoiadendron giganteum forms a type of mycorrhizae referred to as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae; seedlings inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi in nurseries can be two to three times larger than noninoculated control seedlings. Mycorrhizal fungi also function in soil nutrient cycling, and their hyphae and reproductive structures (spores, <b>mushrooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>truffles)</b> are vital components in the complex forest food web. Management strategies that protect the biological component of the soil will ultimately protect the health and functioning of the entire forest ecosystem. Ecological management of natural resources requires a broad understanding of how ecosystems function. Likewise...|$|E
