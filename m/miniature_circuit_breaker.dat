25|$|An early form of {{circuit breaker}} was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses. Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> {{similar to the ones}} now in use was patented by Brown, Boveri & Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP (Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392. Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.|$|E
5000|$|For convenience, <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are {{now almost}} always {{used in the}} fuse box instead of fuses as these can easily be reset by occupants.|$|R
50|$|The {{first problem}} is {{resolved}} {{by the use of}} circuit breakers—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> operate {{solely on the basis of}} electromagnetism. In these <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker's</b> contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design however arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> used {{to protect}} control {{circuits}} or small appliances may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are called [...] "supplemental circuit protectors" [...] to distinguish them from distribution-type <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b>|$|R
25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as a fuse or <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with overcurrent protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E
2500|$|The DIN rail-mounted thermal-magnetic <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{the most}} common style in modern {{domestic}} consumer units and commercial electrical distribution boards throughout Europe. The design includes the following components: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, RCDs can fit on {{the same}} DIN rail as the MCBs, however the busbar {{arrangements}} in consumer units and distribution boards can make it awkward to use them in this way. [...] If it is desired to protect an individual circuit, an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection) can be used. This incorporates an RCD and a <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in one device.|$|E
25|$|Bimetal strips {{are used}} in <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> to protect <b>circuits</b> from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and {{operates}} a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.|$|R
50|$|The Rectiverter module {{contains}} an AC/AC connection which {{eliminates the need}} for a separate centralized static bypass switch. In addition, the AC output port is designed for supplying an overcurrent pulse for tripping <b>Miniature</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breakers</b> (MCBs) and clear short circuit currents. The advantages of the bypass switch are maintained while the single point of failure is eliminated.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are {{manufactured}} in standard sizes, using {{a system of}} preferred numbers to cover a range of ratings. <b>Miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> Larger <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> can have adjustable trip settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> with a 400 ampere [...] "frame size" [...] might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.|$|R
2500|$|A {{residual-current device}} (RCD), or {{residual-current circuit breaker}} (RCCB), is a device that {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (<b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker)</b> is known as a RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection). In Australia, they are sometimes known as safety switches or an RCD. An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a residual-current device, although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists.|$|E
50|$|Where space permits, a <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{sometimes}} used {{to replace a}} blade-type fuse in the same fuse holder.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Legrand Arteor was {{the largest}} {{globally}} for switches and sockets, with 20% of the global market, {{and it was also}} globally largest in cable management (15% of the global market), generating 75% of its turnover internationally. It ranks second in India for sales of switches and sockets, and ranks first for <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCBs) and distribution boards (DBs).|$|R
2500|$|In the UK, older {{electrical}} consumer units (also called fuse boxes) are fitted {{either with}} semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses [...] or cartridge fuses [...] (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5A-, 15A- and 30A-rated wire wound {{on a piece}} of cardboard.) [...] Modern consumer units usually contain <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} EMC {{issue was}} lightning strike (lightning electromagnetic pulse, or LEMP) on buildings. Lightning rods or lightning conductors {{began to appear}} in the mid-18th century. With the advent of widespread electricity generation and power supply lines from the late 19th century on, problems also arose with equipment short-circuit failure affecting the power supply, and with local fire and shock hazard when the power line was struck by lightning. Power stations were provided with output <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> Buildings and appliances would soon be provided with input fuses, and later in the 20th century <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCB) would come into use.|$|R

25|$|Low-voltage <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCB) use air {{alone to}} {{extinguish}} the arc. These <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> contain so-called arc chutes, {{a stack of}} mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and fuses may {{be rated}} to {{interrupt}} {{as little as}} 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose low-voltage fuses must interrupt at least 10,000 amperes and certain types useful for large commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 amperes. The rating of power <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> varies according to the application voltage; a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> that interrupts 50,000 amperes at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 amperes at 600 volts, for example. Direct-current systems such as used with batteries are {{more of a problem}} than alternating current systems, because in the latter current regularly stops.|$|R

40|$|Low {{voltage current}} {{limiting}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{referred to as}} <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCBs) are widely used for electrical fault protection in domestic and light industrial installations.

The paper presents a selective review of the significant work relevant to the study of arc phenomena in MCBs under short circuit conditions.

25|$|Some {{companies}} manufacture resettable <b>miniature</b> thermal <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> which screw into a fuse socket.

The RCDs are used for earth leakage protection, while RCBOs combine earth leakage protection with overcurrent protection. In a UK-style board, breaker positions are numbered top to bottom in the left-hand column, then top to bottom in the right column.|$|E
