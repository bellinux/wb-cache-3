5|$|Anton is a {{special-purpose}} supercomputer {{built for}} <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-µs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E

The aim of {{this text}} is to present a surface hopping {{approximation}} for <b>molecular</b> quantum <b>dynamics</b> obeying a Schrödinger equation with cross-ing eigenvalue surfaces. After motivating Schrödinger equations with matrix valued potentials, we describe the single switch algorithm and present some numerical results.

We emphasize the generality of this surface hopping approximation for non-adiabatic transitions. 1. <b>Molecular</b> Quantum <b>Dynamics</b> 1. 1. The Schrödinger Equation.

25|$|Surface hopping {{is a mixed}} quantum-classical {{technique}} that incorporates quantum mechanical effects into <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> simulations. Traditional <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the lighter electrons adjust instantaneously to {{the motion of the}} nuclei. Though the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applicable {{to a wide range of}} problems, there are several applications, such as photoexcited dynamics, electron transfer, and surface chemistry where this approximation falls apart. Surface hopping partially incorporates the non-adiabatic effects by including excited adiabatic surfaces in the calculations, and allowing for 'hops' between these surfaces, subject to certain criteria.|$|E
