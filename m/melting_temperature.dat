ANALYSIS OF REARVIEW MIRROR CASE PRODUCT OF PS 135 BY THE REGULATION OF <b>MELT</b> <b>TEMPERATURE</b> PARAMETER OF THE POLYPROPYLENE (PP) PLASTIC MATERIAL ON INJECTION MOLDING PROCESS (A CASE STUDY AT THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OF PT. SINAR AGUNG SELALU SUKSES, KARANGANYAR, CENTRAL JAVA) Skripsi: the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebalas Maret University, July 2013) The objectives {{of this research}} are to investigate: (1) the effect of <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> parameter on the quality product resulting from the injection molding, (2) the <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> parameter resulting in the best rearview mirror case on the injection molding process of polypropylene (PP) plastic product by using the simulation software, and (3) the correspondence between the simulation software and the production application in industry for the work parameter design of <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> on the injection molding process of polypropylene (PP) plastic product. This research was conducted by analyzing the quality product injection molding of the rearview mirror case product of PS 135. The analysis with simulation used the software of Autodesk Inventor 2013. The work parameter of the injection molding included the mold temperature of 50 °C, the maximum machine injection pressure of 85 MPa, the injection time of 2 s, and the clamp open machine time of 7 s, with the variations of <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> of 200 °C, 210 °C, 220 °C, 230 °C, 240 °C, 250 °C, 260 °C, 270 °C, 280 °C, and 290 °C. The variations of <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> were executed by using the injection molding machine of Haitian HTF 160 X. The data of the research were analyzed by using the descriptive technique of analysis. The result of the {{research shows that the}} <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> parameter influence the total part weight, quality prediction, shrinkage defect, and sink mark defect of the rearview mirror case product of PS 135. The increase in the <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> causes the decrease in the total part weight.

In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price.

Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
