The duo {{recorded}} a demo EP titled Scrape <b>My</b> <b>Lungs</b> in 1993, but {{then took a}} break until 1996, when they recruited drummer John Merryman, guitarist Steve Goldberg and bassist Doug Williams. Merryman also collaborated with Secret Chiefs 3. Soon after the reformation, their second demo EP Fortuitous Oddity was released. During 1997, Cephalic Carnage financed its own tour across the United States.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an {{experiment}} {{conducted by the}} British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named [...] "dephlogisticated air". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: [...] "The feeling of it to <b>my</b> <b>lungs</b> was not sensibly {{different from that of}} common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards." [...] Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled [...] "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air" [...] which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.|$|E

2500|$|During a fall movie preview, Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Malkovich [...] "easily racks {{up the most}} laughs" [...] among the cast as the foul-mouthed and short-tempered ex-CIA man. The first scene Malkovich {{performed}} was a phone call in which he shouts several obscenities at Pitt and McDormand. But Malkovich could {{not be on the}} sound stage for the call because he was rehearsing a play, so he called in the lines from his apartment in Paris. Regarding the scene, Malkovich said, [...] "It was really late at night and I was screaming at the top of <b>my</b> <b>lungs.</b> God knows what the neighbors thought." [...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well.

In the book, co-authored with French journalist Omar Guendouz as ghostwriter, Bakari provides details about her survival and rescue. She discloses that immediately after the crash, {{she thought she had}} fallen out of the airplane by pressing her forehead too hard against the window, and that her motherwho she believed had landed safely without herwould scold her for not wearing her seat belt. Then, floating on debris {{in the midst of a}} jet fuel slick released from the aircraft's burst fuel tanks, she recalls having [...] "...this taste of fuel in my mouth, mixed with salt, which burned my throat, <b>my</b> <b>lungs</b> and my stomach." [...] Bakari writes that she only realized her plane had crashed and that she was the sole survivor when she was in the hospital, believing until then that she had simply fallen out into the ocean.

2500|$|The {{songs on}} the album played {{important}} roles on Aguilera's legacy. [...] "Genie in a Bottle", the album's lead-single, was a number-one hit and Aguilera became the third female artist in 1999 to top the Hot 100 chart with her debut entry, behind Britney Spears's [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "If You Had My Love". Allmusic highlighted that the single incredibly hit number-one on the Billboard's Hot 100 chart before a music video was even out. [...] "Genie" [...] was listed at number 38 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s, About.com placed it at number 2 on her [...] "Top 10 Songs", while AOL Radio ranked at number-one, calling it her [...] "signature song". While listing the [...] "100 Greatest Singers of All Time", Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 52, picking [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] {{as one of her}} [...] "key tracks", writing that [...] "Even in her teen-pop 'Genie in a Bottle' days, she was modeling her dramatic, melismatic technique on old-school soul heroines like Etta James." [...] It was also the top selling debut single of 1999. The song was also covered by contestants of many popular talent shows such as American Idol, The X Factor and The Voice. The success of the follow-up single [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] solidified her as a strong musical force and earned her several accolades, including five MTV Video Music Awards nominations and a Grammy Award nomination. The song's title inspired the title of 2000's American romantic comedy film [...] "What Women Want", having the track on its soundtrack and on a scene. It also inspired the title of the 2003 comedy film of the same name. [...] "I Turn to You" [...] inspired American recording artist Lady Gaga, as she stated, [...] "When I was 15, I was singing 'I Turn to You' at the top of <b>my</b> <b>lungs</b> trying to hit all her notes. So she was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range." [...] With the album's fourth single, [...] "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)", Aguilera managed to have three number-one singles for the same album and four top-ten singles, an achievement she only did with her first album. As well as that, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed the album at #127 on their 200 Definitive Albums of All Time lists.|$|E

5|$|<b>My</b> Iron <b>Lung,</b> an EP {{and single}} {{released}} late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album.

It was also Radiohead's first collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of their artwork since.

5000|$|<b>My</b> Iron <b>Lung</b> is {{the third}} {{extended}} play (EP) by English alternative rock band Radiohead, released on 26 September 1994 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Capitol Records in the United States.
