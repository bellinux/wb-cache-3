We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
500|$|A 2007 Vogue {{profile of}} Grant {{referred}} {{to him as a}} man with a [...] "professionally misanthropic mystique". Grant has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: [...] "It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with {{the way they used to}} release films, more slowly, let them build?" [...] The director Mike Newell has said: [...] "There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy." [...] Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that [...] "he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless."

500|$|Despite {{a mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Miracle at St. Anna received some praise. Eric D. Snider, writing for Film.com praised the film, writing, [...] "This {{is beyond the}} scope of anything Lee has done before, and he rises to the challenge remarkably well, with battle scenes nearly as visceral and jolting as those in Saving Private Ryan and a multi-layered story involving the U.S. Army, the Nazis, and the Italian resistance movement." [...] Snider criticized the film's frame story, which he described as [...] "unnecessary and definitely corny." [...] James Verniere of the Boston Herald awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and a [...] "classic American WWII movie that both acknowledges the rousing tradition of such war epics as The Longest Day (1962) and The Big Red One (1980) and adds something new: paying tribute to the World War II African-American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, criticized the editing but praised the film overall, describing it as [...] "epic" [...] with [...] "one of the best battle scenes I can remember, on par with Saving Private Ryan...Miracle at St. Anna contains richness, anger, history, sentiment, fantasy, reality, violence and life. <b>Maybe</b> <b>too</b> much. Better than too little." ...|$|E

500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her private}} life, Hepburn {{preferred}} to wear casual and comfortable clothes, {{contrary to the}} haute couture she wore on screen and at public events. Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that [...] "you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn't conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found {{the only way to}} get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive." [...] In 1989, she stated that [...] "my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prominent lyrics in {{the song}} include, [...] "I heard you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?"; [...] "Heaven is a place on earth with you/ Tell me {{all the things you}} want to do"; and [...] "open up a beer... and play a video game?" [...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that the inspiration for the song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E

60|$|Meantime, Philip was in raptures {{with the}} {{kindness}} of the beautiful Madame de Selinville. He, whom the Mistresses Walsingham treated as a mere clumsy boy, was promoted by her manner {{to be a man}} and a cavalier. He blushed up to the roots of his hair and looked sheepish whenever one of her entrancing smiles lit upon him; but then she inquired after his brother so cordially, she told him so openly how brilliant had been Berenger's career at the court, she regretted so heartily their present danger and detention, and promised so warmly to use her interest with Queen Catherine, that in the delight of being so talked to, he forgot his awkwardness and spoke freely and confidentially, <b>maybe</b> <b>too</b> confidentially, for he caught Berenger frowning at him, and made a sudden halt in his narrative, disconcerted but very angry with his brother for his distrust.|$|E

You'll never be happy unless you marry Mr. Arthur; so don't you go and throw away a chance, just out of foolishness, and for fear of what folks say. That's how dozens of women make a mess of it. Folks say one thing to-day and another to-morrow, but you'll remain you for all that. Maybe he's married; and, if so, it's a bad business, and there's an end of it; but <b>maybe,</b> <b>too,</b> he isn't. As for that letter, as likely as not the other one will put it in the fire.

Miss Fosbrook would have given a great deal not to have been obliged to do it, but she had {{prompted}} flagrantly already, and a teacher is obliged to have a conscience quite as much as a scholar; so the book was given back, and Susan spent twelve minutes in see-sawing herself, and going over the sentences in a rapid whispering gabble, a serious worry to the governess in listening to Bessie's practising and David's reading, but she {{thought it would be a}} hardship to be forbidden to learn in her own way at that moment, and forbore. David was interrupted in his [...] "Little Arthur's History," [...] and looked rather cross about it, for Susan to try again. She made all the same blunders--and more too! Back again! Poor Susie! Once, twice, thrice, has she read those stupid words over, and knows less of them than before. Davy's loud voice will go into her understanding instead of those French phrases. She looks up in dull stupefaction.|$|E
