500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would have if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley {{was pleased with the}} result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|Cher's final studio album for Geffen Records, Love Hurts (1991), {{stayed at}} {{number one in}} the UK for six weeks and {{produced}} the UK top-ten single [...] "Love and Understanding". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label [...] "hit years" [...] had been especially significant to her, [...] "because I was getting to do songs that I really loved... songs that really represented <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were popular!" [...] She released the exercise book Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos [...] and [...] She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992. That year, the UK-only compilation album [...] peaked at {{number one in the}} country for seven weeks. It features three new songs: [...] "Oh No Not My Baby", [...] "Whenever You're Near", and [...] "Many Rivers to Cross".|$|E

500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I think for the first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E

Kennedy Jr. in June 2005, Scarborough expressed concerns {{about the possibility that}} one of his sons may have suffered vaccine damage (See Thiomersal controversy). Scarborough said [...] "My son, born in 1991, has a slight form of autism called Asperger's. When I was practicing law and also when I was in Congress, parents would constantly come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would bring me videotapes of their children, and they were all around the age of my son or younger. So, something happened in 1989." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E

That was seen as an attempt to press Pasternak to give up writings critical of the Soviet system. In a 1958 letter to a friend in West Germany, Pasternak wrote, [...] "She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the secret police to be closest to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> hoped that by means of a grueling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial.

2500|$|Appointed {{chief of}} staff of the 165th Regiment, Donovan fought in another battle that took place near Landres-et-Saint-Georges on October 14–15, 1918. Going into battle, Donovan [...] "ignored the officers' custom of {{covering}} or stripping off insignia of rank (targets for snipers) and instead sallied forth wearing his medals", according to Evan Thomas. [...] "They can't hit <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> won't hit you!" [...] he told his men. Struck in the knee by a bullet, he [...] "refused to be evacuated and continued to direct his men until even American tanks were turning back under withering German fire." [...] After lobbying by his friend Father Francis Duffy, a famous and widely revered Army chaplain, Donovan was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster{to what medal?} for his service in that battle. After the Armistice, Donovan remained in Europe as part of the occupation. On returning to New York in April 1919, Donovan, now a colonel, was widely discussed as a possible candidate for governor, but he rejected the idea, proclaiming his intention to return to Buffalo and resume the practice of law.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the time}} which purgatory lasts, the {{accepted}} opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, {{it is only}} forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23–24: [...] "From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched"; the former interpreting the words [...] "from one new moon to another" [...] to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words [...] "from one Sabbath to another," [...] in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15–16, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4–5; R. H. 16b), {{the souls of the}} wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [...] ), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).|$|E
2500|$|Balachander {{wanted the}} same artistes to reprise their roles on television. Unfortunately, Sivakumar was {{committed}} to a daily soap. Suhasini was willing to play Sindhu but Balachander {{decided to have a}} different face—he felt if Suhasini played Sindhu, viewers would expect Sivakumar to play JKB. [...] "You cannot separate JKB and Sindhu. Sir (Balachander) felt {{if we are going to}} have a different JKB, let's have a different Sindhu too," [...] says Subha. This is when Y. Gee. Mahendra, a well-known theater and film personality was selected to play JKB. [...] "It is a challenge for a comedy artist like me to do a character role like JKB. I am enjoying both the challenge and the role," [...] he said. He, who has acted in more than 300 films, said it is a kind of homecoming for him. [...] "I acted in a Balachander film 26 years ago!". He was not worried about the fact that JKB was once successfully portrayed by Sivakumar. [...] "Had it been done by Sivaji (Sivaji Ganesan), I would not have accepted the role. Only two people inspire <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are K. Balachander and Sivaji [...] When I have KB on the sets to guide me, why should I worry?

2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
