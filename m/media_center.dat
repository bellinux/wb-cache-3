40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the school library <b>media</b> <b>centers</b> and {{programs}} in the state of Nebraska with the intent of determining their adequacy as compared to the recommendations found in Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, published by the American Association of School Librarians and Association for Educational Communications and Technology. These Guidelines serve as a standard for library <b>media</b> <b>centers</b> and programs throughout the nation. The recommendations found in the Guidelines are based on the analysis of data obtained from the study conducted by the Center for Education Statistics of the U. S. Department of Education, entitled: Statistics of Public and Private School Library <b>Media</b> <b>Centers,</b> 1985 - 86. ^ Results of the data obtained from surveys sent to library media personnel throughout the state were analyzed in the same manner as the data in the Guidelines. The results indicated about the same percent of library <b>media</b> <b>centers</b> in Nebraska are providing high levels of service to students and staff as are libraries nationwide. The majority of the schools in the state which are low service schools, however, are elementary schools. These centers spend less of their budgets on books, subscriptions and audiovisual materials, while a greater proportion of their expenditures go to computers and computer related materials relative to high service schools. These low service schools also frequently have inadequate numbers of personnel serving students and staff. All the returned surveys indicated insufficient use of technology, except for computers, in library <b>media</b> <b>centers.</b> ^ The effects of Federal legislation on library <b>media</b> <b>centers</b> was also explored [...] particularly changes made in the early 1980 s. These changes provided for the disbursement of Federal Funds based on applications from individual school districts, rather than the previous system of earmarking funds for specific programs. School districts frequently apply for and utilize funds specifically to upgrade computer hardware and software, thus excluding library <b>media</b> <b>centers</b> from receiving the benefit of much needed additional funds. ...|$|R
