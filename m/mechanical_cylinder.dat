40|$|The U. S. {{natural gas}} {{pipeline}} industry {{is facing the}} twin challenges of increased flexibility and capacity expansion. To meet these challenges, the industry requires improved choices in gas compression to address new construction and enhancement of the currently installed infrastructure. The current fleet of installed reciprocating compression is primarily slow-speed integral machines. Most new reciprocating compression is and will be large, high-speed separable units. The major challenges with the fleet of slow-speed integral machines are: limited flexibility and a large range in performance. In an attempt to increase flexibility, many operators are choosing to single-act cylinders, which are causing reduced reliability and integrity. While the best performing units in the fleet exhibit thermal efficiencies between 90 % and 92 %, the low performers are running down to 50 % with the mean at about 80 %. The major cause for this large disparity is due to installation losses in the pulsation control system. In the better performers, the losses are about evenly split between installation losses and valve losses. The major challenges for high-speed machines are: cylinder nozzle pulsations, mechanical vibrations due to cylinder stretch, short valve life, and low thermal performance. To shift nozzle pulsation to higher orders, nozzles are shortened, and to dampen the amplitudes, orifices are added. The shortened nozzles result in mechanical coupling with the cylinder, thereby, causing increased vibration due to the cylinder stretch mode. Valve life is even shorter than for slow speeds and {{can be on the}} order of a few months. The thermal efficiency is 10 % to 15 % lower than slow-speed equipment with the best performance in the 75 % to 80 % range. The goal of this advanced reciprocating compression program is to develop the technology for both high speed and low speed compression that will expand unit flexibility, increase thermal efficiency, and increase reliability and integrity. Retrofit technologies that address the challenges of slow-speed integral compression are: (1) optimum turndown using a combination of speed and clearance with single-acting operation as a last resort; (2) if single-acting is required, implement infinite length nozzles to address nozzle pulsation and tunable side branch absorbers for 1 x lateral pulsations; and (3) advanced valves, either the semi-active plate valve or the passive rotary valve, to extend valve life to three years with half the pressure drop. This next generation of slow-speed compression should attain 95 % efficiency, a three-year valve life, and expanded turndown. New equipment technologies that address the challenges of large-horsepower, high-speed compression are: (1) optimum turndown with unit speed; (2) tapered nozzles to effectively reduce nozzle pulsation with half the pressure drop and minimization of <b>mechanical</b> <b>cylinder</b> stretch induced vibrations; (3) tunable side branch absorber or higher-order filter bottle to address lateral piping pulsations over the entire extended speed range with minimal pressure drop; and (4) semi-active plate valves or passive rotary valves to extend valve life with half the pressure drop. This next generation of large-horsepower, high-speed compression should attain 90 % efficiency, a two-year valve life, 50 % turndown, and less than 0. 75 IPS vibration. This program has generated proof-of-concept technologies with the potential to meet these ambitious goals. Full development of these identified technologies is underway. The GMRC has committed to pursue the most promising enabling technologies for their industry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The braking force mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of braking force required to halt the vehicle with minimum stopping distance, {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the braking force in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of braking force developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum braking force on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle stopping distance. In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the stopping distance of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional braking system.

Before ASR cracking occurred, changes in the mechanical properties of the reac-tive cylinders were minor. After cracking, the compressive strength, split-ting tensile strength, and dynamic modulus of the cylinders were significantly reduced.

The results of the thermo-mechanical analysis indicate that the maximum temperature and stress occurr in the valves bridge. The results of the finite element analysis correspond with the experimental tests carried out by researchers, and illustrate cracks in cylinder heads in this region. The results of the thermo-mechanical analysis show that when the engine is running, the stress in the region is compressive, caused by thermal loading and combustion pressure. When the engine is shut off, the compressive stress turns into tensile stress because of assembly loads. The valves bridge is under cyclic tensile and compressive stress state and thus is subject to low cycle fatigue. After several cycles fatigue cracks will appear in this region.

40|$|An apparatus, VCK, is {{designed}} and built to replace the physical damper and springs of the VIVACE (Vortex Induced Vibrations for Aquatic Clean Energy) Converter with a motor-controller system. VIVACE harnesses hydrokinetic energy of water currents by converting it to mechanical energy using VIV. Next, it converts the <b>mechanical</b> energy of <b>cylinders</b> in VIV into electricity. VCK enables conducting high number of model tests quickly as damping and springs are set by software rather than hardware. The controller provides a damper-force and spring-force feedback based on displacement and velocity measurements, thus, introducing no additional artificial force-displacement phase lag, which would bias energy conversion. The damping of even such a simple spring-damper-mass system is strongly nonlinear, even in air, particularly away from the system’s natural frequency and strongly affects modeling near {{the ends of the}} VIV synchronization range. System identification in air reveals nonlinear viscous damping, static friction, and kinetic friction. Hysteresis, which occurs in the zero velocity limit, is successfully modeled by a proposed nonlinear dynamic damping model LARNOS (Linear Autoregression combined with NOnlinear Static model). To obtain the optimal VIVACE power at a given current speed, extensive VIV tests are performed with the VCK VIVACE apparatus for Reynolds number 40, 000 <Re< 120, 000 and damping 0 <ζ< 0. 16 in the Low Turbulence Free Surface Water Channel of the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory at the University of Michigan. Scarce VIV data exist in that parametric subspace of Re and ζ. From the VIV tests, the optimal damping for energy harnessing is found for velocity 0. 41 m/s<U< 1. 11 m/s using spring stiffness 400 N/m<k< 1800 N/m.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{companion}} piece to my short film, “Victorian Organ”. This film {{is an effort}} to contextualize the mechanical, or man-made, within nature. It is an assertion that there really is no 2 ̆ 2 man vs. nature 2 ̆ 2 - (a radically illogical and inherently self-destructive notion), but only man as nature, in which case, alienation and disharmony ultimately lies in our own self-perception. The impulse to identify a relationship between the mechanical and organic is inspired not only by my observations of our human society, but as a way to decode my own inner workings –an urge to reconcile seemingly major dichotomies like reason and emotion. In the film, these ideas are illustrated by pulling the viewer through the innards of a self-winding, mechanically musical tree. The central metaphor is the encrypted code of the music box cylinder {{at the heart of the}} tree, whose rotating bumps dictate not only the notes of the tree’s song, but the pattern of cell growth [...] a spinning <b>mechanical</b> chromosome. The <b>cylinder</b> is wound by a key nested in the center of the root structure, pushed by the tree’s own organically formed roots. The key eventually reaches its extreme point and reverses direction, turning the cylinder and playing out its code like a music box.

In terms of reliability, when finding the limits of parametric stability of the system considered in achieving this limit defining parameter system, consider the condition of parametric stability of automatic control systems for stationary systems, whose parameters may slowly change over time (by virtue of aging or other causes) that consider these systems as quasi-stationary or non-stationary. Also determine how this condition affects the reliability of the system. Scientific novelty of the work lies in the use of parametric failure criterion of robust stable systems, which combines the classic indicators of reliability of technical systems and the stability criteria for calculating the reliability of frequency-dependent automatic control systems, including barometric altimeters based {{pressure sensor}}s with mechanical resonators. This criterion will also take into account the physical processes of degradation of the system during its operation the normalization adjusting next time (overhaul period duration). Using parametric failure criterion of robust stable systems allowed developing methodology for calculating barometric altimeters. The practical applicability. When analyzing the reliability of self-oscillating circuit frequency-dependent system of "mechanical resonator - excitation system oscillations" frequency barometric altimeter to use the proposed criterion, considering as a defining parameter own <b>cylinder</b> oscillation frequency <b>mechanical</b> resonator. To approximate mathematical model of frequency changes over time using a linear probability model physically change the natural frequency of a cylindrical cavity in time due to his physical degradation (thickening of the wall of the cylinder due to attached mass condensation and pollution working environment, change of elastic modulus due to fatigue and aging, etc.). ???????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ???????; ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ?? ????? ?? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????

40|$|Despite careful storage, early <b>mechanical</b> {{recordings}} on <b>cylinders</b> {{and flat}} disc formats {{have been identified}} as at risk from deterioration, caused mainly by material degradation and biological attack from mould growth. There is therefore an urgency to transfer the content of culturally-important artefacts to digital format to preserve the recordings’ content for archival posterity. However, some recordings are too precious to risk playback using conventional stylus methods because the very act of using a mechanical stylus playback system may in some circumstances contribute to further damage to the integrity of the sound contained in the recording’s groove, caused by wear. Other artefacts, such as 78 s exhibiting delamination of the shellac from the metallic substrate, may be too damaged for a stylus to be a practical method for transfer. In recent years there has been a significant quantity of research aimed at developing optical measurement systems for mechanical recordings for non-contact sound recovery. 2 -D imaging systems using high-resolution photography have been developed for flat disc recordings where the sound modulations are encoded as lateral undulations of the sound-carrying groove. However, in cylinder recordings and some 78 s the modulations are in a vertical plane relative to the groove, in so-called ‘hill and dale’ modulations. To measure these features requires 3 -D surface profiling using optical sensors that measure the surface topology by determining the displacement distance between the surface and the sensor. Systems have been independently developed by the Ukrainian Institute for Information Recording Problems, Syracuse University (US) and Hokkaido University group in Japan for 3 D measurement of the sound carrying groove. However, these methods require a tracking system to guide the optical sensor in the nominally helical path around the cylinder to follow the groove. This tracking must be robust at time of measurement, a task which is made difficult by damage and deformation of the artefact’s surface. An alternative transfer strategy being developed through collaboration between the University of Southampton, the British Library Sound Archive, and TaiCaan Technologies Ltd, uses optical sensors to measure the recording’s surface in its entirety. A significant outcome from this approach is the full high precision digital record of the artefact’s surface form for preservation, which is available for future research. The post-measurement processing of the surface topology data makes use of image and signal processing to reconstruct the audio content of the recording. This aspect of the research is aimed at facilitating access to the audio content of culturally-important artefacts by current generations. In this paper we provide a detailed overview of the scanning process for cylinder recordings, the data processing techniques used to recover the audio from the data and describe the high sensor precision required for measuring the surface for successful audio extraction. We show examples of groove damage thought to originate from repeated stylus playback, and highlight the advantages offered by this scanning strategy for application to damaged or even broken recordings...|$|R
