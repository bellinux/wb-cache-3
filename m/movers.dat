5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime <b>Movers</b> {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Most restorations of ceratopsians {{show them}} with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which {{suggest that they}} were not fast <b>movers.</b> But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air <b>movers</b> following {{the passage of}} the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|E

5|$|Under the April 1942 organization, each {{infantry}} battalion had an anti-tank platoon {{with four}} 37mm guns (1/4 ton trucks, {{better known as}} jeeps, were authorized as prime <b>movers)</b> and each regiment an anti-tank company with twelve (towed by 3/4 ton trucks). Each of the four divisional artillery battalions possessed six anti-tank guns, the combat engineering battalion had nine pieces (towed by M2 halftracks); in addition, the division's headquarters company had four (towed by 3/4ton trucks) and the divisional maintenance company two.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born {{resident}} of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, {{both of whom}} served in the provincial assembly, were the prime <b>movers</b> of Patriot activity in the area, {{which was one of}} several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots in these communities were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 6, 1951 {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters the previous April, and the first Democratic victory in the city in more than a half-century. The positions contested were those of mayor and district attorney, and all seventeen city council seats. There was also a referendum on whether to consolidate the city and county governments. Citywide, the Democrats took majorities of over 100,000 votes, breaking a 67-year Republican hold on city government. Joseph S. Clark, Jr. and Richardson Dilworth, two of the main <b>movers</b> for the charter reform, were elected mayor and district attorney, respectively. Led by local party chairman James A. Finnegan, the Democrats also took fourteen of seventeen city council seats, and all of the citywide offices on the ballot. A referendum on city-county consolidation passed by a wide margin. The election marked the beginning of Democratic dominance of Philadelphia city politics, which continues today.|$|E

5|$|The basic prototypes of the M32 {{were created}} by Lima Locomotive on January 11, 1943. The prototypes were labeled T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. These designs competed against the T2 and T7 designs, which both had a turret mounted boom, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The T5 was {{declared}} superior to the T2 and T7 designs after several weeks of testing. The four prototypes were sent to Aberdeen (T5 and T5E1), Camp Hood (T5E2), and Camp Seely (T5E4). However, during the testing the T5E3's engine was damaged, so it could not go through further testing. OCM 21553 standardized the designs of the T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and the T5E4 as the M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and the M32E4 in June 1943. This protocol also terminated the T7 project. However, the M32E4 did not enter production. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime <b>Movers,</b> which were used to tow heavy artillery. The M34s were unarmed, and had special equipment to pull heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the <b>movers,</b> in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime <b>movers,</b> are noticeably louder.|$|E
5000|$|A speed {{reference}} as {{percentage of}} actual speed {{is set in}} this mode. As the generator is loaded from no load to full load, the actual speed of the prime <b>mover</b> tends to decrease. In order to increase the power output in this mode, the prime <b>mover</b> speed reference is increased. Because the actual prime <b>mover</b> speed is fixed by the grid, this difference in speed reference and actual speed of the prime <b>mover</b> is used to increase the flow of working fluid (fuel, steam, etc.) to the prime <b>mover,</b> and hence power output is increased. The reverse will be true for decreasing power output. The prime <b>mover</b> speed reference is always greater than actual speed of the prime <b>mover.</b> The actual speed of the prime <b>mover</b> is allowed to [...] "droop" [...] or decrease {{with respect to the}} reference, and so the name.|$|R

5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth <b>movers</b> were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a concrete bridge over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish the job as it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation of The Bronx was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not yet have a designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal <b>movers</b> in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E

40|$|With remarkably few exceptions, the {{molecules}} mediating synaptic vesicle exocytosis at active zones are structurally and functionally conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. <b>Mover</b> {{was found in}} a yeast- 2 -hybrid assay using the vertebrate-specific active zone scaffolding protein bassoon as a bait. Peptides of <b>Mover</b> have been reported in proteomics screens for self-interacting proteins, phosphorylated proteins, and synaptic vesicle proteins, respectively. Here, we tested the predictions arising from these screens. Using flotation assays, carbonate stripping of peripheral membrane proteins, mass spectrometry, immunogold labelling of purified synaptic vesicles, and immuno-organelle isolation, we found that <b>Mover</b> is indeed a peripheral synaptic vesicle membrane protein. In addition, by generating an antibody against phosphorylated <b>Mover</b> and Western blot analysis of fractionated rat brain, we found that <b>Mover</b> is a bona fide phospho-protein. The localization of <b>Mover</b> to synaptic vesicles is phosphorylation dependent; treatment with a phosphatase caused <b>Mover</b> to dissociate from synaptic vesicles. A yeast- 2 -hybrid screen, co-immunoprecipitation and cell-based optical assays of homomerization revealed that <b>Mover</b> undergoes homophilic interaction, and regions within both the N- and C- terminus of the protein are required for this interaction.

Renegotiation-proofness imposes some restrictions, which is most transparent in games with externalities, i. e., games in which the first <b>mover's</b> payoff increases (or decreases) in the second <b>mover's</b> action.
