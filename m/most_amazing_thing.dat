500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

[...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick."

500|$|Steve Palopoli of Metro Silicon Valley said, [...] "Musically, {{the show}} is heavy on the hits, {{although}} considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts {{that seem to have}} been handed down in regards to the music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" [...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion that {{the kind of person who}} goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E

[...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the <b>most</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.|$|R
