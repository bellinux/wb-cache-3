5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} {{media coverage of}} the so-called military covenant as the government has been accused of failing to meet it; this criticism came from not just the media, but also several previous Chiefs of the Defence Staff said the government needed to do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> support injured troops and their families.|$|E

As of June 30, 2008, {{data from the}} Federal Election Commission showed the NRSC with $24.6 million on hand, {{as compared with the}} DSCC's $43 million. The NRSC chair, Senator John Ensign, took the unusual step of chastising the Republican Senators who, like him, are not facing re-election, and who he thought should have done <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> raise money for their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Brother Walfrid {{regularly}} invited Hibs {{to play in}} Glasgow before Celtic were formed. This {{included a}} match against Renton that drew a crowd of over 12,000. Glasgow had a far greater Irish population than Edinburgh. Brother Walfrid realised that a Glasgow club {{could do a lot}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Irish population in that city than relying on charity from an Edinburgh club. This led in November 1887 to the formation of Celtic, who played their first match in May 1888 with players mostly borrowed from Hibs.|$|E

25|$|Yale has a {{complicated}} relationship with its home city; for example, {{thousands of students}} volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial.

25|$|A {{friend and}} romantic interest, Joanne Herring, {{encourages}} Charlie to do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Afghan people, and persuades Charlie {{to visit the}} Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the Soviet Union, and they insist that Charlie visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. Charlie is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 BBC News article, {{reporter}} Jonah Fisher {{suggested that}} Aung San Suu Kyi’s silence over the Rohingya issue {{is due to}} a need to obtain support from the majority Bamar ethnicity as she is in “the middle of a general election campaign”. In May 2015, the Dalai Lama publicly called upon her to do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging. In May 2016, Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed United States Ambassador to Myanmar, Scot Marciel, not to refer to the Rohingya by that name. This followed Bamar protests at Marciel’s use of the word “Rohingya”.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker {{called it}} the best {{historical}} drama about the Holocaust, a movie that [...] "will take its place in cultural history and remain there." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as Spielberg's best, [...] "brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen." [...] Ebert named it one of his ten favorite films of 1993. Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's [...] "narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness." [...] He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise, and calls {{the scene in the}} shower at Auschwitz [...] "the most terrifying sequence ever filmed." [...] In his 2013 movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a four-star rating, calling it a [...] "staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller," [...] saying [...] "this looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before". He also described it as [...] "Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date". James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a [...] "major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust." [...] In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized [...] "were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement." [...] Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the [...] "visual brilliance" [...] of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as [...] "realistic" [...] and [...] "stunning". He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe. The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
