5|$|Nintendo GameCube memory cards, {{on which}} saved games are kept, can be {{inserted}} into these arcade units. A <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> {{is required for}} players {{a chance to win}} the AX-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in GX. Players can store up to four machines from GX on a <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> then play them in AX. If a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is used with a magnetic stripe card, players have additional options; they can enter stored GX machines into the F-Zero AX Internet ranking system, and transfer custom AX machine parts to GX. F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges. It was discovered in early 2013 that the arcade version is playable within the GameCube version by the use of a cheat cartridge.|$|E
5|$|In fall 2000, Riis {{took over}} Professional Cycling Denmark and the team. After 2000 the {{contract}} with Jack & Jones expired, and Riis did not continue working with <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> due to their financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It {{could also be used}} as a standard PlayStation <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> by connecting it to a PlayStation <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Memory</b> card: <b>Memory</b> <b>cards</b> are flash <b>memory</b> {{storage media}} used to store digital {{information}} in many electronics products. The types of <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> include CompactFlash, PCMCIA, secure digital <b>card,</b> multimedia <b>card,</b> <b>memory</b> stick etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{are subject}} to similar licence {{arrangements}} as CDs and DVDs, so the majority of <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> sold in the Channel Islands are supplied through EU distributors.|$|R
5|$|For 2000, <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> A/S, a Danish {{producer}} of memory cards, stepped in as co-sponsor and Danish cyclist Bo Hamburger {{was brought in}} as captain. The 2000 season did not have as many wins as in 1999 but the calibre was higher and the team {{took part in the}} 2000 Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire, {{or simply}} Pokémon Box, is a {{spin-off}} Pokémon {{game for the}} GameCube console, bundled with a Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable and a <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> 59. It was released in Japan on May 30, 2003 and in North America on July 11, 2004, but only through the New York Pokémon Center and its online store. It is no longer available in either location. The game was released {{in some parts of}} Europe as Pokémon Memory Magic due to translation problems, and Europeans only could get the game by using points from Nintendo of Europe's loyalty program, or by buying the Pokémon Colosseum Mega Pack.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the sixth}} {{generation}} of video game consoles, <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{were based on}} proprietary formats; later systems have used established industry hardware formats for <b>memory</b> <b>cards,</b> such as FAT32.|$|R

5000|$|Secure Digital <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be used}} in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders via the MEAD-SD01 adapter. JVC camcorders {{that record}} in XDCAM EX format use Secure Digital <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> natively.|$|R
5|$|Section D {{believes}} banker Alexis Meynell {{is trying}} to bankrupt the country. Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) asks the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gillian Calderwood (Selina Cadell) to freeze Meynell's assets, but is turned down {{due to lack of}} evidence. To get the evidence they need, Ros is sent undercover to the London Stock Exchange, where Meynell is targeting the bank Highland Life. After starting a rumour about the bank, he starts betting against it. When the chairman of Highland Life, Francis Debham (Simon Williams), attempts to keep the bank afloat, Meynell doubles his position, bankrupting Highland Life. Ros uses the opportunity to swipe a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> from Meynell's mobile phone, containing his secure email account that could prove his guilt. However, they find nothing relevant. Lucas North (Richard Armitage) relays this to Ros and tells her to get closer to Meynell.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} and accessories were {{developed for the}} WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold {{at a cost of}} ¥11,800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a mobile phone network.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
5000|$|Many AVCHD camcorders employ Secure Digital or [...] "Memory Stick" [...] <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> as {{removable}} recording media. Solid-state <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> offer rewritable {{storage in}} a compact form factor with no moving parts.|$|R
50|$|Later, Sony {{partnered with}} a {{third-party}} accessories company Katana to make <b>Memory</b> <b>Cards</b> {{that came in}} 16 MB and 32 MB. These <b>Memory</b> <b>Cards</b> were officially licensed products and has the PlayStation 2 logo, and says Magic Gate on them.|$|R
50|$|There are {{accessories}} for the Disney Mix Stick sold separately. Customers {{can purchase}} a docking station with speakers, wall charger, {{two different types}} of headphones, carrying cases, and preloaded <b>memory</b> <b>cards.</b> The pre loaded <b>memory</b> <b>cards,</b> called Mix Clips, go right into the top memory slot.|$|R
5|$|PlayStation Underground was a {{non-traditional}} {{magazine that}} Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, {{along with a}} booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or coming soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground {{to focus on the}} JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2. PlayStation Underground CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} {{each level}} are {{various types of}} crates, most of which contain items such as Wumpa Fruit and Aku Aku masks, {{which can be broken}} by jumping on or spinning into them. Other types of crate include checkpoint crates, which lets players resume their progress after losing a life, arrow crates which Crash can bounce on, and explosive TNT crates that explode upon being broken, or following a timer that activates by jumping on them. Certain crates, including steel platform crates, are invisible, requiring the player to hit an exclamation box to make them tangible. If the player clears a level with all crates broken without dying, they will earn a gem. Additional gems can be obtained through hidden levels or alternate routes, and some gems are required to access new areas. Collecting all gems in the game allows the player to reach its true ending. If the player manages to collect enough bonus icons, they will be warped to a Bonus Stage which, upon completion, will allow the player to save their progress, either via <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> or password.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{directly}} controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only see {{from the perspective of}} Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of Final Fantasy XII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the overworld on foot, Chocobo, or by airship. Players may save their game to a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> using save crystals or gate crystals, and may use the latter to teleport between gate crystals. An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XII.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{is that many}} consumer devices (e.g., digital cameras, portable music players) cannot make use of USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{compatible}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> varies from reader to reader and can include more than 20 different types. The {{number of different}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> that a multi card reader can accept is expressed as x-in-1, with x being a figure of merit indicating the number of <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> accepted, such as 35-in-1. There are three categories of card readers sorted by the type and quantity of the card slots: single card reader (e.g. 1x SD-only), multi card reader (e.g. 9-in-1) and series card reader (e.g. 4x SD-only).|$|R
50|$|In contrast, <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> (such as Secure Digital (SD), CompactFlash (CF), {{and many}} others) were {{originally}} designed for digital cameras and later {{found their way}} into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly. There are adapters which enable some <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer. The typical CompactFlash card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD. As <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.|$|R
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
25|$|Some drives offer {{expandable}} storage via {{an internal}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> slot, {{much like a}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> reader.|$|E
25|$|The PlayStation 3 <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> Adaptor is {{a device}} that allows data to be {{transferred}} from PlayStation and PlayStation 2 memory cards to the PlayStation 3's hard disk. The device has a cable that connects to the PS3's USB port on one end, and features a legacy PS2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> port on the other end.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1960s, motor drives, {{electronic}} flash, auto-focus, better {{lenses and}} other camera enhancements have made picture-taking easier. New digital cameras free photojournalists from {{the limitation of}} film roll length. Although the number depends {{on the amount of}} megapixels the camera contains, whether one's shooting mode is JPEG or raw, and what size of <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> one is using, it is possible to store thousands of images on a single <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
25|$|Secure Digital (SD) is a {{non-volatile}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> format {{developed by}} the SD Card Association (SDA) for use in portable devices.|$|E
25|$|While {{previous}} system updates have been stored on internal memory, {{this is the}} first update to require a storage device. The update requires at least 128MB free space on either a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> or a hard drive. Microsoft has stated that many Core or Arcade users will not have sufficient space on their limited memory cards for the new update and thus provided them with a free 512MB <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> or a discounted 20GB hard drive for a limited time. This promotion has since ended and all new arcade units now come with 512MB of internal memory.|$|E
