5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} process produces and supplies {{products to the}} distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> process lead to shorter cycle times, meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.|$|E
5000|$|Strategic {{plans are}} drawn up with {{suppliers}} {{to support the}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> management process {{and the development of}} new products. In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance, many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), {{which are}} an {{extension}} to the Petri Nets, {{are used for}} performance evaluation of manufacturing systems. Using our formalism, a manufacturing system is hierarchically represented in three different layers: the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> layer, the control layer and the network layer. SAN models are constructed {{for each of these}} layers. To simplify the understanding of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow,</b> a new graphical representation, the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Flow</b> Network (MFN) has been developed. Conversion of MFN into SAN models simplifies the modeling of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> layer. When MFN at the product level is very complex, a decomposition technique is applied to reduce complexity of the model under specific conditions. The accuracy of this technique is shown for specific conditions. Finally, a performance evaluation of a sample manufacturing system is shown, using the simulation for solution of the model. Performance variables of interest such as machine utilization, machine availability and operation queue length are discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMax-plus algebra {{can be used}} {{to model}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> lines using linear state-space-like {{equations}} which can be used in analysis and control. This paper presents a method for easy and quick generation of the max-plus equations for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> lines of any size or structure. The generated equations can model flow lines with infinite as well as finite buffer sizes. A flow line to be modeled is initially assumed to have infinite buffers for all stations. The line model equations are then generated as a combination of serial and merging stations after identifying the different stages using an adjacency matrix for the flow line. In the generated equations, the dynamics of the system are captured in two matrices that are function of the processing times of the different stations in the line. After generating these equations, extra terms are added to account for the finite buffers where for each buffer size, a matrix is added multiplied by the vector of system parameters delayed by the buffer size plus one. The method is intuitive and easy to understand and code in software and thus can facilitate quick analysis of different configurations of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> lines and assessing what if scenarios. This can also allow quick on-line reconfiguration of controllers for frequently reconfiguring flow lines...|$|E
40|$|This brief {{deals with}} a control {{framework}} for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> lines. For this framework, a continuous approximation model of the manufacturing system is required, which is computationally feasible and able to accurately describe {{the dynamics of the}} system (both throughput and flow time). Often used models, such as discrete-event models and flow models, fail to meet these specifications: the use of discrete-event models may lead to intractably large control problems, while flow models do not accurately describe the system dynamics. Therefore, we consider here a relatively new class of models for the description of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> lines, namely partial differential equation (PDE) -models, which seems to meet the required specifications. However, for the few ldquomanufacturingrdquo PDE-models that have been introduced in literature so far, the accuracy has not been validated yet. In this brief, we, therefore, present a validation study on three of these PDE-models available from literature, which shows {{that there is a need}} for more accurate PDE-models. Furthermore, we propose to use one of these PDE-models for the design of a model predictive controller (MPC-controller), which is to be applied in closed loop with a discrete-event <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flow</b> line. For two considered tracking problems, the resulting MPC-controller is shown to outperform a classical push strategy...|$|E

Here we charac-terize the performance of PFCAs under the following three non-optimal conditions. First, we show that PFCAs can operate while sensing light of a wavelength other than the design point. Second, if only a randomly-selected subset of 10 % of the ASPs are functional, we can nonetheless reconstruct the entire far-away scene using compressed sensing. Third, if the wavelength of the imaged light is unknown, it can be inferred by demanding self-consistency of the outputs...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the structure}} of material flows between urban centres. It {{is based on the}} results of a French survey that describes shipments sent by firms accross the country. Its aim is to shed light on the organization of urban systems. While most of works on urban systems are focused on the most visible and obviously dominant cities, little attention has been devoted to the basis of urban hierarchies. The purpose of this paper is to help fill this void, by integrating higher and lower levels of urban hierarchy. In order to do this, freight flows are analyzed to understand what they highlight on the economic interactions between the urban centres. This research shows that the pattern of freight flows between urban areas in France is hierarchical, but varies depending upon whether the flows are generated by wholesale trade activities or by manufacturing. The differences are explained by the specific organizational characteristics of each of these two activities. Wholesale trade broadly reflects the traditional spatial organization of service activities, with interlocking areas of influence. The spatial organization of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flows</b> is more complex, which can be attributed to the regional specialization of activities. it should be highlighted that many of the outputs of manufacturing are inputs for wholesale trade. The majority of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>flows</b> involve parts and semi-finished goods that are not distributed to the market but to other manufacturing units, or to large purchasers who then coordinate the distribution of these goods. The exception could be certain fresh food products (i. e. Dairy), which, in their final form (ready for consumption), have a market-based distribution structure, similar to wholesale trade...|$|R

In addition, we discuss the concept of design-driven fill synthesis that seeks to optimize CMP fill with respect to objectives beyond mere density uniformity.
