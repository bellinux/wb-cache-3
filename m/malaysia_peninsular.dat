50|$|The {{purpose for}} the dam {{was to meet}} growing demand for electricity.

The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to <b>Peninsular</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> This plan envisioned 730 km of overhead HVDC transmission lines in East Malaysia, 670 km of undersea HVDC cable and 300 km of HVDC transmission line in <b>Peninsular</b> <b>Malaysia.</b>|$|R
