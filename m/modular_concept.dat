25|$|After {{the success}} of the EMB 110 Bandeirante, Embraer began the {{development}} of their first transport category airliner in 1974. The Family 12X comprised three models with <b>modular</b> <b>concept</b> designs: EMB 120 Araguaia, EMB 123 Tapajós and EMB 121 Xingu. EMB 121 was the sole 12X model effectively produced. Araguaia's name was changed to Brasilia in 1979 at the official launching of the project, when at a CAAA (Commuter Airline Association of America) convention at USA several suggestions from prospective operators were collected and incorporated to EMB 120 design. Thus, a completely new aircraft – no longer related to the 12X family – was launched. No common parts from EMB 121 Xingu were used, and the capacity was revised from 24 to 30 seats. Originally designed to utilise the new 1500 shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PW115 turboprop, it was later upgraded to the 1892 eshp PW118.|$|E
2500|$|Very high {{temperatures}} {{are required to}} dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen. A catalyst is required to make the process operate at feasible temperatures. Heating the water can be achieved {{through the use of}} concentrating solar power. [...] Hydrosol-2 is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200°C to heat water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a <b>modular</b> <b>concept.</b> As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to the megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to heliostat fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.|$|E

40|$|The {{benefit of}} <b>modular</b> <b>concepts</b> in plant {{automation}} is seen ambivalent. On one hand it offers advantages, {{on the other}} hand it also sets requirements on the system structure as well as discipline of designer. The main reasons to use modularity in systems design for automation applications in industry are reusability and reduction of complexity, but up to now <b>modular</b> <b>concepts</b> are rare in plant automation. This paper analyses the reasons and proposes measures and solution concepts. An analysis of the work flow and the working results of some companies in several branches show different proposals of modularity.
