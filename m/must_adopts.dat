40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the design and implementation of MuST, a multilingual information retrieval, summarization, and translation system. MuST integrates machine translation and other text processing services to enable users to perform cross-language information retrieval using available search services such as commercial Internet search engines. To handle non-standard languages, a new Internet indexing agent can be deployed, specialized local search services can be built, and shallow MT {{can be added to}} provide useful functionality. A case study of augmenting MuST with Indonesian is included. <b>MuST</b> <b>adopts</b> ubiquitous web browsers as its primary user interface, and provides tightly integrated automated shallow translation and user biased summarization to help users quickly judge the relevance of documents...|$|E
40|$|The Haitian Diaspora {{continues}} {{to bring an}} important and growing financial contribution to the Haitian economy. These remittances are countercyclical, without condition, fast and anti-crisis, greater than international aid. However, {{the participation of the}} Diaspora in the economic and social development of Haiti {{does not seem to be}} possible only through remittances. Our modest proposal is that Haitian Diaspora <b>must</b> <b>adopts</b> a smarter and more efficient approach consisting of, but not necessarily stop supporting the survival of recipient families, 1) finance productive projects and entrepreneurial initiatives; 2) involve and contribute to improve haitian higher education, through a top-down scheme, either through teaching assignments or joint supervision of education and research projects, 3) as much as possible, come back to Haiti to have non erroneous analysis and provide direct participation. Finally, considering that development is related to education and the Haitian population is predominantly young, Diaspora can support, meanwhile optimizing financial resources, both Haitian youth through education and support of entrepreneurship, and Haitian government through institutional strengthening. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{function}} as gene regulatory elements {{in response to}} environmental signals, riboswitches <b>must</b> <b>adopt</b> specific secondary structures on appropriate time scales.

Our findings suggest both that riboswitch transcriptional terminator sequences have been naturally selected for high folding efficiency, and that sequesterers can maintain their function even in the presence of significant misfolding...|$|R
