They can be exploited, for example, in catalysis, bioinorganic chemistry, heavy metal abstraction and molecular magnetism. Furthermore, compounds of this type can be found in natural chemicals, commercial products and industrial applications. In this dissertation, several 3 d, 4 d and 5 d transition metal complexes with polydentate amino- and amidophenolate ligands were prepared and their structure, reactivity and magnetic properties were studied with experimental and computational techniques. In the first part of the dissertation, the solid-state structure, reactivity and magnetic properties of 12 novel 3 d transition metal complexes were examined. The magnetic behavior of a polynuclear metal complex can be linked to its solid-state structural features to constitute so-called magnetostructural correlations. A clear connection between the <b>M-O-M</b> angles and exchange coupling constants was found in the studied dinuclear Fe(III) complexes. Similar magnetostructural correlations were not equally strong in dinuclear ferromagnetically coupled mixed-valence Mn(II) /Mn(III) system.

40|$|The {{development}} of organic optoelectronics has progressed rapidly. These devices are now {{an essential part}} of our lives (e. g. mobile phone, computer, energy applications and touch-enabled applications). With increasing demand for mass production of low-cost materials, researchers are readily seeking new innovative materials to replace conventional materials based on polymers or small molecules. Metal oxides {{are one of the most}} interesting classes of materials, but their current processing is incompatible with organic systems and their application in this field requires new simplified methods of deposition. In this thesis, zinc acetate dihydrate (ZnAc 2 H 2 O) has been selected as a precursor for the formation of ZnO. It is inexpensive, has high volatility and demonstrates the oligomerisation of basic zinc acetate (BZA) in vacuum, which is known as a molecular model of ZnO. While there are limited reports of BZA films and powder in the literature, this is the first time that it is fully characterised. The BZA film is prepared on room temperature substrates, with and without pre-coating of 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylenetetracharboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) using organic molecular beam deposition (OMBD), which convey high quality films with well-controlled film thickness and high purity. Contrasting the morphology of the two films, the growth mode for the former is known as “Frank-van-der-Merwe” whereas the latter is “Stranski-Krastanov”. This formation is critical since film orientation and morphology can dramatically alter device performance. A new method for processing metal oxide using small molecules at room temperature has been developed. This method depends on exposing small molecule film to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light, generating a photon energy of 7. 2 eV (172 nm) via several degradation mechanisms. The effect of atmosphere and irradiation length are evaluated by altering the partial pressure of oxygen and adjusting the height of the sample stage during the VUV process, respectively. The presence of oxygen molecules inducing oxygen radicals and ozone plays a major role in the degradation reaction. This is significantly greater than the effect of irradiance. Finally, a new, room temperature method, VUV process, is used on two BZA films to explore whether this is suitable to the formation of ZnO. Both films exposed to VUV light under different atmospheric conditions show the formation of <b>M-O-M</b> species, with optimised results for high vacuum conditions. Varying the irradiation length results in further enhancement of <b>M-O-M.</b> Furthermore, the underlying PTCDA is preserved during UV exposure. This suggests that ZnO formation acts as an effective barrier layer protecting the underlying organic components. Open Acces...|$|E

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra showed evidence of chemical modification from TeO 4 trigonal bipyramids (tbp) to TeO 3 trigonal pyramids (tp) in tellurite glasses. The optical band gaps of the different glass samples calculated using Tauc’s method were found to range from 3. 5 - 3. 8 eV. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and glass stability (∆T) of alkali tellurite glasses were investigated, as M 2 O [M: Li, Na, K] amounted to 25 mol%, through the use of differential thermal analysis (DTA). The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was measured in a thermo mechanical analysis (TMA) with a slow heating rate after the glass samples were annealed. The results confirm that the optical band gap of alkali tellurite glasses depends on the Te-O-Te structural relaxation related to the ratio of bridging/ non bridging oxygen (BO/NBO). In contrast, the thermal properties are related to the ionic field strength of the Te-O-M and <b>M-O-M</b> bonds, and the Te-O-Te breakage depends on the ratio of BO/NBO.

The ultimate goal is to use these relationships to guide materials design. In this study, 101 intrinsic OER activities of 51 perovskites were compiled from five studies in literature and additional measurements made for this work. We explored the behavior and performance of 14 descriptors of the metal–oxygen bond strength using a number of statistical approaches, including factor analysis and linear regression models. We found that these descriptors can be classified into five descriptor families and identify electron occupancy and metal–oxygen covalency as the dominant influences on the OER activity. However, multiple descriptors still need to be considered in order to develop strong predictive relationships, largely outperforming the use of only one or two descriptors (as conventionally done in the field). We confirmed that the number of d electrons, charge-transfer energy (covalency), and optimality of eg occupancy play the important roles, but found that structural factors such as <b>M–O–M</b> bond angle and tolerance factor are relevant as well.

To characterize these new materials, a variety of analytical techniques have been utilized including both single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, Weissenberg X-ray photographs, thermal analysis (TGA and DTA), magnetic susceptibility and four-probe conductivity measurements. Additional relevant techniques for characterization of inorganic solids were also used. Our study of structure/property correlations should prove insightful towards {{a better understanding of the}} conducting mechanism in technologically important metallic oxides and in the development of new materials with desired applications...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the synthesis, structure and magnetic investigations {{of a series of}} metal-organic framework compounds formed with Mn+ 2 and Ni+ 2 ions. The structures, determined using the single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicated that the structures possess two- and three-dimensional structures with magnetically active dimers, tetramers, chains, two-dimensional layers connected by polycarboxylic acids. These compounds provide good examples for the investigations of magnetic behaviour. Magnetic studies have been carried out using SQUID magnetometer in the range of 2 - 300 K and the behaviour indicates a predominant anti-ferromagnetic interactions, which appears to differ based on the M-O-C-O-M and/or the <b>M-O-M</b> (M = metal ions) linkages. Thus, compounds with carboxylate (Mn-O-C-O-Mn) connected ones, [C 3 N 2 H [Mn(H 2 O) "C 6 H 3 (COO) (3) "], I, ["Mn(H 2 O (3) "aEuroeC(12) H(8) O(COO) (2) "]center dot H 2 O, II, ["Mn(H 2 O) "aEuroeC(12) H(8) O(COO) (2) "], III, show simple anti-ferromagnetic behaviour. The compounds with Mn-O/OH-Mn connected dimer and tetramer units in [NaMn"C 6 H 3 (COO) (3) "], IV, [Mn- 2 (A mu(3) -OH) (H 2 O) (2) "C 6 H 3 (COO) (3) "]center dot 2 H(2) O, V, show canted-antiferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic behaviour, respectively. The presence of infinite one-dimensional -Ni-OH-Ni- chains in the compound, [Ni- 2 (H 2 O) (A mu(3) -OH) (2) (C 8 H 5 NO 4], VI, gives rise to ferromagnet-like behaviour at low temperatures. The compounds, [Mn- 3 "C 6 H 3 (COO) (3) "(2) ], VII and ["Mn(OH) "(2) "C 12 H 8 O(COO) (2) "], VIII, have two-dimensional infinite -Mn-O/OH-Mn- layers with triangular magnetic lattices, which resemble the Kagome and brucite-like layer. The magnetic studies indicated canted-antiferromagnetic behaviour in both the cases. Variable temperature EPR and theoretical magnetic modelling studies have been carried out on selected compounds to probe the nature of the magnetic species and their interactions with them...|$|E
40|$|Developing diluted {{magnetic}} semiconductors (DMSs) is {{an essential}} step toward the realization of spintronic devices where both the charge and the spin of the electrons are manipulated. However the mechanism governing the magnetic interactions in these materials challenges our understanding of magnetism in solids. This challenge mainly lies in the complex interplay between magnetic ions of the DMSs and the intrinsic and extrinsic defects of the host materials. Another contributing factor is the inhomogeneous distribution of the doped magnetic ions in the host materials {{which leads to the}} unintentional formation of hetrostructures and secondary phases which adversely affect the magnetic properties of DMSs. In this dissertation, the magnetic interactions in the DMSs based on Mn, Co and Eu doped ZnO were studied using density functional theory methodology. Additionally, the effect of most common point defect in ZnO, i. e. oxygen vacancy and hydrogen impurity in Co doped ZnO oxides was considered. It was found that in the Mn and Co doped ZnO, there is a strong tendency among the magnetic ions to aggregate via oxygen and form variety of highly stable <b>M-O-M</b> (M stands for transition metals) complexes. Such aggregation was not found to occur in Eu doped ZnO which implies more homogeneous doping pattern for Eu ions and possible achievement of intrinsic ferromagnetism in Eu doped ZnO. Magnetically, it was found that in all Co, Mn and Eu doped ZnO, no ferromagnetism can be induced without an aid from another agent. Specifically, p-type carrier doping by nitrogen proved to establish carrier mediated ferromagnetism in both Mn and Co doped ZnO. Hydrogen contamination in both substitutional and interstitial sites could also open a channel for long range spin-spin interaction and led to room temperature ferromagnetism in Co doped ZnO. However the most stable defect in ZnO, oxygen vacancy did not contribute significantly to magnetism in Co doped ZnO. In Co doped ZnO, Eu codoping resulted in room temperature ferromagnetic alignment between Co and Eu ions and thus enhanced magnetization. As a result Eu and Co codoped ZnO was found to be the potential candidate for technological applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} metal oxides {{have been the}} source of many fascinating physical phenomena such as high Tc superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and orbiton physics [1]. These surprising and diverse physical properties arise from strong correlation effects in the 3 d bands. Most theoretical attempts to understand such systems are based on the Hubbard model. Here we report that for high symmetry {{transition metal}} oxides with threefold t 2 g bands, this model possesses several novel hidden symmetries with many surprising consequences on the ground state properties [2, 3]. We consider cubic 3 d 1 perovskites (i. e., ABO 3) where the five initially degenerate 3 d states are split into a two-fold eg manifold and a lower-energy threefold t 2 g manifold with wavefunctions dyz ≡ X, dxz ≡ Y, and dxy ≡ Z (see Fig. 1). Keeping only the t 2 g states, we base our discussion on the following generic three-band Hubbard Hamiltonian: Here ci,α,σ creates a t 2 g electron (or hole) on the ith ion in the α spatial orbital (i. e., α = X, Y or Z) with spin σ, and εi,α is the on-site energy of the orbital at site i of a simple cubic lattice. Uiα,iβ is the on-site Coulomb repulsion between orbitals α and β at site i. tiα, jβ is the effective hopping parameter from the α orbital at site i to the β orbital at its nearest neighbour site j. As shown in Fig. 2, for cubic perovskites where the metal-oxygen-metal (<b>M-O-M)</b> bond is linear, the hopping parameter tiα, jβ is diagonal in the orbital indices α and β. This suggests that the total number of electrons in each orbital is a good quantum number. Furthermore tiα, jβ is zero along the “inactive ” axis perpendicular to the orbital plane α, due to symmetry (Fig. 2). In other words an α-electron can only hop in α-plane. Thus, for the nth + plane perpendicular to the α-axis, the total number Nnα of electrons in the α-orbital is conserved, i. e., it is a good quantum number. Hence, one can consider the three dimensional lattice as a superposition of interpenetrating planes perpendicular to the x, y, and z-directions, each having a constant number of X, Y, and Z electrons, respectively, which are good quantum numbers (se...|$|E

40|$|Open-framework {{materials}} {{constitute an}} important {{area of study}} in materials chemistry, because of their potential applications {{in areas such as}} sorption and catalysis. Furthermore, these materials exhibit fascinating architectures with unusual bonding and coordination patterns. Besides aluminosilicate zeolites and metal phosphates, metal carboxylates constitute an important family of open-framework structures. In this thesis, results of investigations of a variety of open-framework metal carboxylates, as well as a new family of rare-earth sulfates are presented. More importantly, studies directed towards an understanding of the mechanism of formation of open-framework phosphates and carboxylates and the importance of synthesis parameters like temperature in determining the dimensionality of the products are discussed at length. After providing an introduction to open-framework compounds (Part 1), the thesis (Part 2) presents the results of the investigations of metal carboxylates employing both transition metal and rare-earth metal ions with various organic linkers, ranging from aromatic squarate dianion, aliphatic dicarboxylates like oxalate, adipate, succinate, aminocarboxylates (which contain both the amine and the carboxylate group in the same moiety) and dihydroxybenzoates. Some of these compounds have large channels, for example, both the lanthanum mixed aliphatic dicarboxylates, strontium dihydroxybenzoate etc. Some even show unusual properties, example, a mixed valent iron (II, III) glycinate has a perfect kagome structure and shows unusual magnetic properties, entirely different from those of ordinary Fe(III) kagome structures, copper derivative of 6 -amincaproic acid has large channels and remains crystalline porous even after dehydration, a cobalt oxalato-squarate has both oxalate and squarate moiety in the same structure, where the oxalate is produced in situ by the oxidation of squarate under hydrothermal conditions in the basic medium. While the phosphate and the silicate anions are the most common basic building units in open-framework inorganic structures, the possibility of building open architectures with the sulfate anion as the basic building unit has been explored in Part 3. The results have been rewarding and both layered and three-dimensional rare-earth sulfates with large channels and possessing a α-Po structure or (6, 3) nets with continuous <b>M-O-M</b> connectivity in two dimensions have been obtained. The most intriguing question in the area of open-framework structures relates to the mode of formation. In Part 4, the mechanism of formation of both metal phosphates and metal carboxylates have been discussed. This part includes a study of the transformations of four-membered ring phosphates to higher dimensional structures (like 3 D sodalite-related structure), through lower-dimensional structures, involving a progressive building-up mechanism. Similar progressive building-up mechanism has also been studied for metal carboxylates. The importance of synthesis parameters like temperature in governing the dimensionality of the products has been studied...|$|E
