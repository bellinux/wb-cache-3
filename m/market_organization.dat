40|$|The {{number of}} {{multilevel}} <b>marketing</b> <b>organizations</b> has been increasing, {{and the number}} of people involved is increasing exponentially. As more people {{become a part of the}} multilevel marketing business model, the negative impacts of some multilevel <b>marketing</b> <b>organization</b> practices on people’s lives is growing due to the high potential for moral hazard amongst multilevel <b>marketing</b> <b>organization</b> leadership. It is my contention that new legislation to protect people involved in this type of organization is critical to dramatically reduce the potential for moral hazard. This paper contends that the practices of some multilevel <b>marketing</b> <b>organizations</b> currently can be comparative to pyramid schemes, which is known to have high moral hazard. But the franchise model, which originally had the potential for similar moral hazard, has been greatly reduced through prudent legislation. The ability of this model to minimize the potential for moral hazard maximizes fairness for all parties involved. Therefore, the franchise model guidelines will be examined to provide for a new model for dramatically reducing the potential moral hazard issues posed currently by multilevel <b>marketing</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

Whilst advances {{have been made in}} conceptualizing <b>marketing</b> <b>organization</b> in networks of large trans-national corporations, recent research has highlighted the paucity of empirical work into the intra-firm dispersion of marketing activities. This study is designed to examine just this issue. The aim is to develop data-grounded insights into the organization and dispersion of marketing activities. A case study finds an unusual form of <b>marketing</b> <b>organization.</b> This form of <b>marketing</b> <b>organization</b> is characterized by the decentralization, devolution and dispersion of community-oriented marketing management activities driven by empowered operational-level part-time-marketers who either adopt a traditional mix-management approach or more rarely a relational approach.
