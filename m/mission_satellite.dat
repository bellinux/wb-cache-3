25|$|Since Japan is {{an island}} nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, {{research}} about {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere is a very important issue. For this reason Japan launched in 1997 the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring <b>Mission)</b> <b>satellite</b> in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term.|$|E
500|$|On August18, {{an area of}} {{showers and}} {{thunderstorms}} associated with a trough formed about [...] west-southwest of Guam. Over the following day, a low-level circulation developed within the trough. Tracking slowly northeastward into a region of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and favorable divergence, continued development was anticipated. Later on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system was anticipated to develop further. Hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the low as a tropical depression. The JTWC followed suit early on August20, designating the system as Tropical Depression 16W. Following the development of convective banding features along the southern side of the low, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the former assigning it the name Bolaven. By this time, the storm began turning northwestward {{in response to a}} subtropical ridge south of Japan. Later on August20, microwave imagery from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring <b>Mission</b> <b>satellite</b> depicted a weak eye-like feature.|$|E

2500|$|NASA's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst <b>Mission</b> <b>satellite</b> was {{monitoring}} Comet Lulin as {{it closed}} to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray {{images of a}} comet. [...] "The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.|$|E

40|$|Designing a <b>satellite</b> <b>mission</b> is a not an {{easy task}} as it {{requires}} thorough consideration, complex calculations and repeated analysis in determining the best design parameters. In designing a <b>satellite</b> <b>mission,</b> {{we need to have a}} structured or systematic approach in tackling the issue. For beginners ine <b>satellite</b> <b>mission</b> design, the process can be an exhaustive and a complex activity. Without careful attention, we may miss some important aspects of the design procedures. Such experience would also contribute to the loss of interest among students. Therefore, a tool that can facilitate the design activity, and minimize the complexity of the activity, is needed. Such tool would also promote active learning amongst students in learning not only the theories in designing a <b>satellite</b> <b>mission,</b> but also the analysis part of the design process. The purpose of this paper is to present a research conducted in developing <b>satellite</b> <b>mission</b> design tool that is aimed to promote better understanding in <b>satellite</b> <b>mission</b> design and analysis techniques to students who specialized in Astronautics. The software, with different design module, is targeted to facilitate analytical aspect of the design process in the form of computer aided interaction (CAl) and computer based learning (CBL).
