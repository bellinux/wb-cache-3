2500|$|Prior to World War 2, {{the only}} {{practical}} sources of radiation for radiotherapy were radium and its [...] "emanation", radon gas, and the x-ray tube. [...] External beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) {{began at the}} turn of the century with relatively low voltage (<150nbsp&kV) x-ray machines. [...] It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages. [...] Orthovoltage X-rays, which used tube voltages of 200-500nbsp&kV, began to be used during the 1920s. [...] To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1nbsp&MV or above, called [...] "megavolt" [...] radiation. [...] Producing <b>megavolt</b> x-rays required voltages on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million volts, which required huge expensive installations. [...] Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions. [...] One of the first, installed at St. Bartholomew's hospital, London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons. [...] Radium produced <b>megavolt</b> gamma rays, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores. [...] In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.|$|E

In particular Winterberg is known for the idea of impact fusion and the concept of the magnetically insulated diode for the generation of multi-megampere <b>megavolt</b> ion beams for the purpose of heating plasmas to thermonuclear fusion temperatures. He conceived of a nuclear fusion propulsion reactor for space travel, which is called the Winterberg / Daedalus Class Magnetic Compression Reaction Chamber, which was later developed at the University of Alabama at Huntsville's Propulsion Research Center. [...] Most recently he has designed a giant spacecraft, propelled with deuterium micro-detonations ignited by a GeV proton beam, drawn from the space craft acting as an electrically charged up and magnetically insulated capacitor Winterberg also developed ideas for mining increasingly rare industrially crucial elements on planetary bodies such as the moon using fusion detonation devices.

It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 <b>megavolts.</b> Although it was used {{for a short period}} in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage.|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, {{the energy}} of {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic gamma- and X-rays is expressed in kilovolts or <b>megavolts</b> (kV or MV), whilst {{the energy of}} therapeutic electrons is {{expressed in terms of}} megaelectronvolts (MeV).

The beam is made up of a spectrum of energies: the maximum energy is approximately equal to the beam's maximum electric potential times the electron charge. Thus a 1 MV beam will produce photons of no more than about 1 MeV. The mean X-ray energy is only about 1/3 of the maximum energy. Beam quality and hardness may be improved by X-ray filters, which improve the homogeneity of the X-ray spectrum.|$|R
