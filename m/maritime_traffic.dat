5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic,</b> which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1944, No. 351 Squadron {{carried out}} a {{successful}} rocket attack against Axis coastal defences on the Island of Lošinj, launching from Vis. This {{was followed by a}} period of scouting and reconnaissance over several Yugoslav regions, hitting targets of opportunity, sometimes escorted and supported by the Spitfires of No. 352 Squadron. No. 351 Squadron ranged widely, interdicting rail and road routes in eastern and western Bosnia and throughout Dalmatia, and attacking Axis <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> off the Adriatic coast and islands. As the year drew to a close, operations became severely hampered by the worsening weather.|$|E
5|$|The Coast and <b>Maritime</b> <b>Traffic</b> Command {{comprised}} three naval commands for the northern, {{central and}} southern sections of the Adriatic coast, headquartered at Crikvenica (later Sušak), Makarska (later Split) and Dubrovnik respectively. These commands were further divided into naval districts; North Adriatic Naval Command was divided into the Kraljevica and Senj Naval Districts, Central Adriatic Naval Command comprised the Omiš, Supertar, Makarska, Metković and Hvar Naval Districts, and South Adriatic Naval Command consisted of the Trpanj, Orebić and Dubrovnik Naval Districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties.|$|E

50|$|The 1989 National Defense Authorization Act {{designated}} the DoD {{as the lead}} agency of the Federal Government for the detection and monitoring of aerial and <b>maritime</b> <b>trafficking</b> of illegal drugs into the United States or any of its commonwealths, territories, or possessions. In turn, the Coast Guard was {{designated the}} lead agency for the interdiction and apprehension of illegal drug traffickers on the high seas. In order to meet these statutory responsibilities, the DoD began deploying surface assets to drug interdiction areas, making ships available for direct support of Coast Guard law enforcement operations.|$|R
40|$|Coupled and interdependent {{networks}} {{constitute a}} relatively recent research field that has been so far little invested by port and maritime specialists. The extent to which certain ports benefit from being connected to multiple commodity flows in the maritime network has in fact been poorly addressed. A global database of merchant vessel inter-port movements that occurred in October and November 2004 allows building the respective weighted graphs of solid bulk, liquid bulk, container, general cargo, and passenger/vehicles. Main results underline a very strong influence of commodity diversity {{on the distribution of}} <b>maritime</b> <b>traffics</b> among ports and links between them. The research also underlines the role of different regional settings in the specialization of traffic flows...|$|R
5|$|The Rush vs. Trickett match {{attracted}} {{the largest number}} of spectators ever before gathered at a Sydney sporting event, and the event is part of Australian sporting history. Estimates {{of the size of the}} crowd range from 30,000 to 70,000. Shops and government offices closed for the event, special trains brought people into the city. Steam-ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions, and hundreds of smaller, private vessels crowded the river. Special Regulations were published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to deal with the problems of regulating <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> during the event.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E

5|$|Puglia served {{abroad for}} much of her early career, {{including}} periods in South American and East Asian waters. She saw action in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, primarily in the Red Sea. During the war she bombarded Ottoman ports in Arabia and assisted in enforcing a blockade on <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> in the area. She was still in service during World War I; the only action in which she participated was the evacuation of units from the Serbian Army from Durazzo in February 1916. During the evacuation, she bombarded the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. After the war, Puglia {{was involved in the}} occupation of the Dalmatian coast, and in 1920 her captain was murdered in a violent confrontation in Split with Croatian nationalists. The old cruiser was sold for scrapping in 1923, but much of her bow was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism. It {{has been suggested}} that, like {{the attack on the}} Suez Canal in 1915, it was merely a raid to disrupt <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E
5|$|After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly {{believed}} to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastian Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> in most coastal towns. The pirates docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed Anne towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} an explorative, {{conceptual}} {{study on the}} fundamental problem of maritime transport. The author suggests that the present mechanism of decision-makings will not function on the currently prevailing paradigm: i. e. freedom of shipping and the economies of scale. The current market mechanism relies on rationality, which is only workable {{within the framework of}} short-term predictability. To address the globalised economies and the eventual increase in <b>maritime</b> <b>traffics,</b> more control will inevitably be extended over the supervision of navigation and shipping management. In this future circumstance, the effectiveness of legislative measures will be limited. Rather, a non-economical value system should be incorporated into the decision-making processes of maritime management. It will be the world where moral and ethic are more seriously dealt with in the maritime economic theories...|$|R

25|$|Despite soon {{developing}} {{a reputation of}} being treacherous to cross in stormy weather, and suffering delays caused by its lifting span opening to allow <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> to pass, it created previously unprecedented access to the eastern shore.

40|$|Undoubtedly, {{the bill}} of lading has to be {{considered}} {{as the most important}} document used in carriages of goods by sea. Born, most probably, in the Middle Age, {{the bill of}} lading at first developed its role as proof of the contract of carriage and receipt of the goods carried on board. Subsequently, it became also a document of title, so extending its capacity even to support the sale of the goods to be carried. At present, the bill of lading appears to be extended to the multimodal transports of goods with excellent results and can be used also in electronic applications. The particular and unique role of this document confirms the speciality of the <b>maritime</b> <b>traffics</b> and, more generally, of the maritime field, and emphasizes the consequent need of relevant studies and special legal rules for the purpose of meeting the evolving demands of the modern transport operators through adequate measures...|$|R
40|$|This chapter aims at {{highlighting}} {{the relationships between}} air, maritime & logistic activities of port cities in Europe. Although recent studies have considered sea-air intermodality as a locational advantage for ports and coastal urban centres, they are still few and isolated case studies. Nevertheless, this subject appears to be of growing interest for transport, logistic players and urban planners to improve port performance in a competitive context. However, there is neither an estimation nor a comparative analysis on effective air-sea relations within port city nodes. We propose a valuation of such potentials based on available and comparable data at a European scale, such as air and <b>maritime</b> <b>traffics,</b> urban population, and employment in specific transport activities (freight forwarding, logistics, warehousing, port and airport services). This innovative approach focuses {{on the level of}} interdependency between airports, ports and cities. It shows that air-sea linkages within European port cities are still not strongly interdependen...|$|R

Like in most small European countries, more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport, the Brussels Airport. The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge (Bruges) share more than 80% of Belgian <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic,</b> Antwerp being the second European harbour with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years.

25|$|From {{the summer}} of 1782, French {{planters}} fleeing the Haitian Revolution began arriving in the port with their slaves. The major outbreak of yellow fever that occurred in Philadelphia the next year probably spread there from an epidemic these refugees brought to Charleston, {{although it was not}} publicly reported at the time. Over the 19th century, the health officials and newspapers of the town came under repeated criticism from Northerners, fellow Southerners, and one another for covering up epidemics as long as possible in order to keep up the city's <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic.</b> The distrust and mortal risk meant that between July and October each year communication nearly shut down between the city and the surrounding countryside, which was less susceptible to yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern shore}} housing boom had {{highlighted}} the inadequacies of the Hobart Bridge. Bad weather {{made it difficult}} to cross, and the massive increase in traffic in the 1950s led to severe congestion. The traffic problems, delays caused by the raising of the navigation section for <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic,</b> and the toll all proved extremely unpopular. The government announced plans to build a new bridge at a cost of £7 million, and in 1960, construction commenced on the Tasman Bridge. It opened on 18 August 1964, and greatly increased the volume of traffic capable of crossing the river. The opening of the new bridge also saw the development of two new major connecting highways, the east-heading Tasman Highway, and the north-heading East Derwent Highway, greatly improving access both to, and through Clarence.|$|E
25|$|Fortified {{military}} {{camps and}} watchtowers {{were also used}} on the southeast coast, in this case to stop migration and plundering by the Franks, Angles and Saxons. From about 270, {{attempts were made to}} gain the upper hand over the seaborne attacks of Germanic marauders using heavily fortified strongholds, some of which were newly built. In his chronicle of {{the second half of the}} 4th century Eutropius reported that the commander of the Classis Britannica, Carausius, was tasked in 285 with tackling Frankish and Saxon piracy in the English Channel. The constant raids on the local coasts hindered <b>maritime</b> <b>traffic</b> and in particular the safe transportation of goods and precious metals to Gaul and Rome. The heavily branched river system in Britain enabled the Germanic invaders to quickly penetrate the interior of the island in their small flat boats. As a countermeasure the Roman administration created a separate military district covering both sides of the English Channel. During Carausius' short-lived Britannic Empire, these strategically important fortresses and naval stations were probably manned by his most loyal officers and soldiers, who could just as easily repel Roman invaders. The exact date of its formation, however, is unknown. However, the military situation in Britain, which was already difficult, worsened still further. The local army command had to face new threats without having enough soldiers available and was therefore forced to withdraw troops from other vulnerable areas of the island.|$|E
