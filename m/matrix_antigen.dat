We recently reported the synthesis of an arylene bis(methyl ketone) compound (CNI-H 0294) that inhibits nuclear targeting of the HIV- 1 genome and thus HIV- 1 replication in monocyte cultures. Here we demonstrate that CNI-H 0294 inhibits nuclear targeting of HIV- 1 -derived preintegration complexes by inactivating the nuclear localization sequence of the HIV- 1 <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> in a reaction that absolutely requires reverse transcriptase. This drug/reverse transcriptase interaction defines the specificity of its antiviral effect and is most likely mediated by the pyrimidine side-chain of CNI-H 0294.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{supports the idea}} that TLR 7 and TLR 9 play pathogenic and protective roles, respectively, {{in the development of}} murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the accelerated development of SLE resulting from the deletion of TLR 9 and the respective contributions of TLR 7 and TLR 9 to the development of different autoimmune responses against nuclear and non-nuclear autoantigens implicated in lupus nephritis have not been well defined. In the present study, we addressed these questions by assessing the effect of the TLR 9 and/or TLR 7 deletion on the production of various autoantibodies and the development of lupus nephritis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice congenic for the Nba 2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B 6. Nba 2). TLR 9 -deficient B 6. Nba 2 mice displayed increased production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, serum retroviral gp 70 and glomerular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens,</b> and developed a markedly accelerated form of lupus nephritis. Enhanced disease was associated with functionally upregulated expression of TLR 7, as documented by an increased TLR 7 -dependent activation of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Notably, disease exacerbation in TLR 9 -deficient mice was completely suppressed by the deletion of TLR 7. Our results indicate that TLR 7 has a pivotal role {{in a wide variety of}} autoimmune responses against DNA- and RNA-containing nuclear antigens, retroviral gp 70 and glomerular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens</b> implicated in murine SLE, and that enhanced TLR 7 activity is critical for the accelerated development of SLE in TLR 9 -deficient lupus-prone mice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective To develop {{flow cytometry}} {{for the study}} of human {{articular}} cartilage cell phenotype and to validate the method on chondrocytes cultured in different in-vitro systems. Methods Chondrocyte phenotype was modulated by culturing the cells under differentin-vitro conditions: i. e. in monolayer and in suspension culture in gelled agarose. Monolayer cultured chondrocyte phenotype was assayed by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies against chondrocyte-specific aggrecan, type II and I collagen. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the proportions of chondrocytes expressing these extracellular matrix molecules in both culture conditions. To exclude the effects of cell-harvesting methods on the presence of cell-bound ECM molecules, non-proteolytic isolation procedures were used to obtain the chondrocytes for flow cytometry. Subconfluent cells from monolayer cultures were detached with EDTA. Chondrocytes cultured in gelled agarose were obtained after the agarose was enzymatically digested with agarase. Results Immunohistochemical staining showed that monolayer-cultured chondrocytes, in the presence of serum, gradually lost the expression of chondrocyte-specific aggrecan and type II collagen, while type I collagen was increasingly expressed. Flow cytometry allowed monolayer cultured chondrocyte phenotype to be assessed reproducibly. Chondrocyte phenotype was characterized through the cell membrane-associated extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens.</b> EDTA, used to obtain single cells from monolayer cultures, did not affect the cell-associated matrix. Where the chondrocytes had been cultured in gelled agarose, flow cytometry allowed quantification of the percentages of chondrocytes maintaining or reexpressing their original phenotype. The agarase digestion procedure used to isolate the cells from the agarose gel did not affect the plasma membrane-associated extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens.</b> Conclusion Flow cytometry allows quantification of cells expressing aggrecan, type II and I collagen in their cell-associated extracellular matrix.

40|$|The nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> {{recognized}} by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) B 1 C 8 is a novel serine (S) and arginine (R) -rich protein associated with splicing complexes and is named here SRm 160 (SR-related matrix protein of 160 kD). SRm 160 contains multiple SR repeats, but unlike proteins of the SR family of splicing factors, lacks an RNA recognition motif. SRm 160 and a related protein SRm 300 (the 300 -kD nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> {{recognized by}} mAb B 4 A 11) form a complex that {{is required for the}} splicing of specific pre-mRNAs. The SRm 160 / 300 complex associates with splicing complexes and promotes splicing through interactions with SR family proteins. Binding of SRm 160 / 300 to pre-mRNA is normally also dependent on U 1 snRNP and is stabilized by U 2 snRNP. Thus, SRm 160 / 300 forms multiple interactions with components bound directly to important sites within pre-mRNA. The results suggest that a complex of the nuclear matrix proteins SRm 160 and SRm 300 functions as a coactivator of pre-mRNA splicing...|$|E

Serum samples from 117 patients with different stages of infection, along with 10 serum samples from seronegative patients obtained for routine diagnostic tests, were used. The results were compared with those of an ELISA that uses a native T. gondii antigen extract. The MAG 1 antigen detected antibodies more frequently from the acute stage (97. 3 %) than from the chronic stage (7. 5 %) of toxoplasmosis.

40|$|Exonic {{splicing}} enhancer (ESE) sequences {{are important}} for the recognition of splice sites in pre-mRNA. These sequences are bound by specific serine-arginine (SR) repeat proteins that promote the assembly of splicing complexes at adjacent splice sites. We have recently identified a splicing “coactivator,” SRm 160 / 300, which contains SRm 160 (the SR nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa) and a 300 -kDa nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen.</b> In the present study, we show that SRm 160 / 300 is required for a purine-rich ESE to promote the splicing of a pre-mRNA derived from the Drosophila doublesex gene. The association of SRm 160 / 300 and U 2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) with this pre-mRNA requires both U 1 snRNP and factors bound to the ESE. Independently of pre-mRNA, SRm 160 / 300 specifically interacts with U 2 snRNP and with a human homolog of the Drosophila alternative splicing regulator Transformer 2, which binds to purine-rich ESEs. The results suggest a model for ESE function in which the SRm 160 / 300 splicing coactivator promotes critical interactions between ESE-bound “activators” and the snRNP machinery of the spliceosome...|$|E

The dot immunobinding assay was nearly as sensitive as the reverse transcriptase assay in detecting HIV antigens in experimentally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, {{as well as in}} a T-cell line.

40|$|The SRm 160 / 300 {{splicing}} coactivator, {{which consists}} of the serine/arginine (SR) -related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa and a 300 -kDa nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen,</b> functions in splicing by promoting critical interactions between splicing factors bound to pre-mRNA, including snRNPs and SR family proteins. In this article we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding the 300 -kDa antigen and investigate the activity of it and SRm 160 in splicing. Like SRm 160, the 300 -kDa antigen contains domains rich in alternating S and R residues but lacks an RNA recognition motif; the protein is accordingly named "SRm 300. " SRm 300 also contains a novel and highly conserved N-terminal domain, several unique repeated motifs rich in S, R, and proline residues, and two very long polyserine tracts. Surprisingly, specific depletion of SRm 300 does not prevent the splicing of pre-mRNAs shown previously to require SRm 160 / 300. Addition of recombinant SRm 160 alone to SRm 160 / 300 -depleted reactions specifically activates splicing. The results indicate that SRm 160 may be the more critical component of the SRm 160 / 300 coactivator in the splicing of SRm 160 / 300 -dependent pre-mRNAs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{describes}} the biochemical characterization {{of a novel}} extracellular matrix component, "myotendinous antigen, " which appears early in chick limb morphogenesis at sites connecting developing muscle fibers, tendons, and bone (Chiquet, M., and D. Fambrough, 1984; J. Cell Biol., 98 : 1926 - 1936). This extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> is {{a major component of}} the secretory proteins released into the medium by fibroblast and muscle cultures; the soluble form is characterized here. This form of myotendinous antigen is a large glycoprotein complex consisting of several disulfide linked subunits (M r 150, 000 - 240, 000). The differently sized antigen subunits are related, since they yielded very similar proteolytic cleavage patterns. M 1 antibody can bind to the denatured subunits. The antigen subunits, as well as a Mr 80, 000 pepsin-resistant antigenic domain derived from them, are resistant to bacterial collagenase. Despite possessing subunits similar in size to fibronectin, myotendinous antigen appears to be both structurally and antigenically unrelated to fibronectin or to other known extracellular matrix components. About seven times more M 1 antigen per cell nucleus was released into the medium in fibroblast as compared to muscle cultures. In muscle conditioned medium, myotendinous antigen is noncovalently complexed to very high molecula...|$|E

The 28 -kDa protein bound proacrosin and the 49 -kDa form of acrosin (a-acrosin) {{but it did not}} bind the 36 -kDa acrosin form (,-acrosin). The acrosin-binding activity of the 28 -kDa protein was stimulated by Ca 2 +, inhibited by Mg 2 +, and removed by disulphide bond reduction. Induction of the acrosome reaction by a calcium ionophore resulted in proteolytic cleavage of the 28 -kDa protein, giving rise to a 12 -kDa degradation product that was the only form of ACR. 4 antigen released to incubation media; the release of the ACR. 4 antigen was closely correlated with that of acrosin. The release of a-acrosin to incubation media was accelerated in the presence of ACR. 4 antibody. In a cell-free system, a limited cleavage of the purified 28 -kDa protein into immunoreactive degradation products was catalyzed by acrosin but not by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The data suggest that the 28 -kDa acrosomal protein helps to maintain acrosomal matrix integrity and controls the acrosin release from acrosome-reacted cells...|$|E

Isolated nuclear matrices, examined by TEM, have parallel filaments within the nuclear branches. Hoechst stained DNA has a similar alignment. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that, although extraordinary in shape, these nuclei have some of the same <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens</b> found in smaller, spherical nuclei. SDS-PAGE of the nuclear-associated (nuclear matrix) fraction revealed few polypeptides, including a nuclear isoform of actin (43 kD, pI 6. 45). Nuclear branches label at their periphery with antibodies to actin and myosin and with rhodaminyl-phalloin which is specific for f-actin. The nuclear-associated fraction contains a lamina-like structure that binds heavy meromyosin and antibodies to actin and myosin. This suggests that actin and myosin are components of a layer at the nucleocytoplasmic boundary called the nuclear shell which may correspond to a cytoplasmic zone containing filaments associated with the nuclear envelope.;During larval moults, globules, which label with antibodies to actin, form in the cytoplasm.

Regional differences exist in the density of these bundles. The greatest density occurs in the narrower anterior regions of the gland and may be correlated with the increased hoop stress resulting from the reduced luminal diameter.

An in vitro assay that reconstitutes nuclear import of HIV- 1 pre-integration complexes in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to demonstrate that Vpr is the key regulator of the viral nuclear import process. Mutant HIV- 1 pre-integration complexes that lack Vpr failed to be imported in vitro, whereas mutants that lack a functional MA nuclear localization sequence (NLS) were only partially defective. Strikingly, the import defect of the Vpr- mutant was rescued when recombinant Vpr was re-added. In addition, import of Vpr- virus was rescued by adding the cytosol of HeLa cells, where HIV- 1 replication had been shown to be Vpr-independent. In a solution binding assay, Vpr associated with karyopherin alpha, a cellular receptor for NLSs. This association increased the affinity of karyopherin alpha for basic-type NLSs, including that of MA, thus explaining the positive effect of Vpr on nuclear import of the HIV- 1 pre-integration complex and BSA-NLS conjugates.

Antibodies against NcMAG 1 -conserved region cross-reacted with the orthologuous protein in T. gondii but those against the variable region did not. This indicates that the variable region possesses unique antigenic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examined}} {{the distribution of}} nonlamin nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens</b> during the mitotic cell cycle in mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Four monoclonal antibodies produced against isolated nuclear matrices were used to characterize antigens by the immunoblotting of isolated nuclear matrix preparations, and were used to localize the antigens by indirect immunofluorescence. For comparison, lamins and histones were localized using human autoimmune antibodies. At interphase, the monoclonal antibodies recognized non-nucleolar and nonheterochromatin nuclear components. Antibody Pl stained the nuclear periphery homogeneously, with some small invaginations toward {{the interior of the}} nucleus. Antibody 11 detected an antigen distributed as fine granules throughout the nuclear interior. Monoclonals PI 1 and P 12 stained both the nuclear periphery and interior, with some characteristic differences. During mitosis, P 1 and 11 were chromosome-associated, whereas P 11 and P 12 dispersed in the cytoplasm. Antibody P 1 heavily stained the periphery of the chromosome mass, and we suggest that the antigen {{may play a role in}} maintaining interphase and mitotic chromosome order. With antibody 11, bright granules were distributed along the chromosomes and there was also some diffuse internal staining. The antigen to 11 may be involved in chromatin/ chromosome higher-order organization throughout the cell cycle. Antibodies P 11 and P 12 wer...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{the human}} embryo depends {{on the ability of}} first {{trimester}} cytotrophoblastic stem cells to differentiate and invade the uterus. In this process, transient expression of an invasive phenotype is part of normal cytotrophoblast differentiation. Morphologically, this process begins when polarized chorionic villus cytotrophoblasts form multilayered columns of nonpolarized cells, and invade the uterus. Using immunocytochemistry, we compared the presence of adhesion receptors and extracellular matrix ligands on cytotrophoblasts in villi, cell columns, and the uterine wall. Villus cytotrophoblasts, anchored to basement membrane, stained for alpha 6 and beta 4 integrin subunits and both merosin and A-chain-containing laminin. Nonpolarized cytotrophoblasts in columns expressed primarily alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin subunits and a fibronectin-rich matrix. Cytotrophoblast clusters in the uterine wall stained for alpha 1, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrins, but not for most extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens,</b> suggesting that they interact primarily with maternal cells and matrices. Tenascin staining was restricted to stroma at sites of transition in cytotrophoblast morphology, suggesting that tenascin influences cytotrophoblast differentiation. Our results suggest that regulation of adhesion molecule expression contributes to acquisition of an invasive phenotype by cytotrophoblasts and provide a foundation for studying pathological conditions in which insufficient or excessive trophoblast invasion occurs, such as preeclampsia or choriocarcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} adult T-cell leukemia, encodes unique regulatory and accessory proteins in the pX {{region of the}} provirus, including the open reading frame II product p 13 II. p 13 II localizes to mitochondria, binds farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, an enzyme involved in posttranslational farnesylation of Ras, and alters Ras-dependent cell signaling and control of apoptosis. The role of p 13 II in virus infection in vivo remains undetermined. Herein, we analyzed the functional significance of p 13 II in HTLV- 1 infection. We compared the infectivity of a human B-cell line that harbors an infectious molecular clone of HTLV- 1 with a selective mutation that prevents the translation of p 13 II (729. ACH. p 13) to the infectivity of a wild-type HTLV- 1 -expressing cell line (729. ACH). 729. ACH and 729. ACH. p 13 producer lines had comparable infectivities for cultured rabbit {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC), and the fidelity of the start codon mutation in ACH. p 13 was maintained after PBMC passage. In contrast, zero of six rabbits inoculated with 729. ACH. p 13 cells failed to establish viral infection, whereas six of six rabbits inoculated with wild-type HTLV- 1 -expressing cells (729. ACH) were infected as measured by antibody responses, proviral load, and HTLV- 1 p 19 <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> production from ex vivo-cultured PBMC. Our data are the first to indicate that the HTLV- 1 mitochondrion-localizing protein p 13 II has an essential biological role during the early phase of virus infection in vivo...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the biochemical characterization {{of a novel}} extracellular matrix component, " myotendinous antigen," which appears early in chick limb morphogenesis at sites connecting developing muscle fibers, tendons, and bone (Chiquet, M., and D. Fambrough, 1984; J. Cell Biol., 98 : 1926 - 1936). This extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> is {{a major component of}} the secretory proteins released into the medium by fibroblast and muscle cultures; the soluble form is characterized here. This form of myotendinous antigen is a large glycoprotein complex consisting of several disulfide linked subunits (Mr approximately 150, 000 - 240, 000). The differently sized antigen subunits are related, since they yielded very similar proteolytic cleavage patterns. M 1 antibody can bind to the denatured subunits. The antigen subunits, as well as a Mr approximately 80, 000 pepsin-resistant antigenic domain derived from them, are resistant to bacterial collagenase. Despite possessing subunits similar in size to fibronectin, myotendinous antigen appears to be both structurally and antigenically unrelated to fibronectin or to other known extracellular matrix components. About seven times more M 1 antigen per cell nucleus was released into the medium in fibroblast as compared to muscle cultures. In muscle conditioned medium, myotendinous antigen is noncovalently complexed to very high molecular weight material that could be heavily labeled by [3 H]glucosamine and [35 S]sulfate. This material is sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and hence appears to contain sulfated glycosaminoglycans. We speculate that myotendinous antigen might interact with proteoglycans on the surface of muscle fibers, thereby acting as a link to tendons...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the MIC 1 (microneme protein 1) -MAG 1 (<b>matrix</b> <b>antigen</b> 1) Toxoplasma gondii recombinant chimeric antigen for the serodiagnosis of human toxoplasmosis for the first time. The recombinant MIC 1 -MAG 1 antigen was obtained as a fusion protein containing His tags at the N- and C-terminal ends using an Escherichia coli expression system. After purification by metal affinity chromatography, the chimeric protein was tested for usefulness in an enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG). One hundred ten sera from patients at different stages of infection and 40 sera from seronegative patients were examined. The results obtained for the MIC 1 -MAG 1 chimeric antigen were compared with those of IgG ELISAs using a Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA), a combination of recombinant anti-gens (rMIC 1 ex 2 -rMAG 1) and single recombinant proteins (rMIC 1 ex 2 and rMAG 1). The sensitivity of the IgG ELISA calculated from all of the positive serum samples was similar for the MIC 1 -MAG 1 chimeric antigen (90. 8 %) and the TLA (91. 8 %), whereas the sensitivities of the other antigenic samples used were definitely lower, at 69. 1 % for the mixture of antigens, 75. 5 % for the rMIC 1 ex 2, and 60 % for rMAG 1. This study demonstrates that the MIC 1 -MAG 1 recombinant chimeric antigen can be used in-stead of the TLA in the serodiagnosis of human toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis, which is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an obli-gate intercellular protozoan parasite, is generally asymptom-atic in healthy individuals but may cause severe complications in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients an...|$|E
40|$|Orthomyxoviridae {{and placed}} in the genus {{influenza}}virus A. There are three influenza genera – A, B and C; only influenza A viruses are known to infect birds. Diagnosis is by isolation of the virus or by detection and characterisation of fragments of its genome. This is because infections in birds can give rise {{to a wide variety of}} clinical signs that may vary according to the host, strain of virus, the host’s immune status, presence of any secondary exacerbating organisms and environmental conditions. Identification of the agent: Suspensions in antibiotic solution of oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (or faeces) taken from live birds, or of faeces and pooled samples of organs from dead birds, are inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9 - to 11 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The eggs are incubated at 37 °C (range 35 – 39 °C) for 2 – 7 days. The allantoic fluid of any eggs containing dead or dying embryos during the incubation and all eggs at the end of the incubation period are tested for the presence of haemagglutinating activity. The presence of influenza A virus can be confirmed by an immunodiffusion test between concentrated virus and an antiserum to the nucleocapsid and/or <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens,</b> both of which are common to all influenza A viruses, or by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the allantoic fluids.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} recognizing laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, fibronectin, and two apparently novel {{connective tissue}} components {{have been used}} to examine the organization of extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle in vivo and in vitro. Four of the five monoclonal antibodies are described for the first time here. Immunocytochemical experiments with frozen-sectioned muscle demonstrated that both the heparan sulfate proteoglycan and laminin exhibited staining patterns identical to that expected for components of the basal lamina. In contrast, the remaining matrix constituents were detected in all regions of muscle connective tissue: the endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium. Embryonic muscle cells developing in culture elaborated an extracellular <b>matrix,</b> each <b>antigen</b> exhibiting a unique distribution. Of particular interest was the organization of extracellular matrix on myotubes: the build-up of matrix components was most apparent in plaques overlying clusters of an integral membrane protein, the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The heparan sulfate proteoglycan was concentrated at virtually all AChR clusters and showed a remarkable level of congruence with receptor organization; laminin was detected at 70 - 95 % of AChR clusters but often was not completely co-distributed with AChR within the cluster; fibronectin and the two other extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens</b> occurred at approximately 20, 8, and 2 % of the AChR clusters, respectively, and showed little or no congruence with AChR. From observations on the distribution of extracellular matrix components in tissue cultured fibroblasts and myogenic cells, several ideas about the organization of extracellular matrix are suggested. (a) Congruence between AChR clusters and heparan sulfate proteoglycan suggests the existence of some linkage between the two molecules, possibly important for regulation of AChR distribution within the muscle membrane. (b) The qualitatively different patterns of extracellular matrix organization over myotubes and fibroblasts suggest that each of these cell types uses somewhat different means to regulate the assembly of extracellular matrix components within its domain. (c) The limited co-distribution of different components within the extracellular matrix in vitro and the selective immune precipitation of each antigen from conditioned medium suggest that each extracellular matrix component is secreted in a form that is not complexed with other matrix constituents...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The humoral immune {{response}} against {{a broad spectrum of}} cartilage <b>antigens</b> (cellular and <b>matrix</b> <b>antigens)</b> was studied in a group of patients who showed resorption and/or rejection of transplanted cartilage in nasal surgery. METHODS [...] Sera were obtained from patients with successful and unsuccessful cartilage grafting in the nose, from age and sex-matched healthy donors and from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Antibodies to cartilage components were analysed by the following methods: (1) indirect immunofluorescence on cartilage sections, (2) ELISA using cultured human chondrocytes, isolated chondrocyte membranes and purified collagens type I, II, III, VI, IX and XI, and (3) immunoblotting with purified collagens and chondrocyte cell membranes. RESULTS [...] In the cartilage grafting group showing resorption problems, levels of anti-collagen antibodies were significantly higher against native collagen types IX (p < 0. 002) and XI (p < 0. 002) compared with the non-resorption group and the normal donors. Both transplantation groups revealed elevated reactivities against isolated chondrocytes in the ELISA. In contrast, no reactivity was detectable against collagens type II, III, and VI and chondrocyte cell membranes by both ELISA and immunoblotting. CONCLUSIONS [...] These data demonstrate {{for the first time the}} existence of a humoral {{immune response}}, primarily directed against the so called 'minor cartilage collagens', in patients showing cartilage resorption. Autoreactivities to collagen which are typical of inflammatory rheumatic diseases may also play an important role in the repeated failure of cartilage grafting...|$|R
