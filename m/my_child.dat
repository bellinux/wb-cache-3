The first productions (Goldfaden's Grandmother and Granddaughter and Shmendrick) were popular successes, but Adler's own account suggests that they were basically mediocre, and his Uncle Arke was appalled: [...] "Is this theater?

500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up <b>my</b> <b>child.</b> I see <b>my</b> <b>child</b> is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the tour's title, Beyoncé was criticized by several critics and feminists alike for entitling it after her husband's name as she has been regarded as a feminist. Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person. During an interview with Vogue, Beyoncé described herself as a [...] "modern-day feminist" [...] and further spoke about her decision to reference her husband's name: [...] "I feel like Mrs. Carter is who I am, but more bold and more fearless than I've ever been.....

25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} {{intended for}} All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> to begin its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All <b>My</b> <b>Children.</b> On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live.

500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can <b>my</b> <b>child</b> find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Dion, the album's title, A New Day Has Come, {{acknowledged}} a {{new chapter}} in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of 11 September and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. [...] "It represents <b>my</b> <b>child,</b> because I gave life," [...] Dion said. [...] "Obviously, it also marks my return with a new album. But a new day has also come in the lives of other people because something bad has happened, because we've lost lives, because there's a scar on our world now." [...] Dion struggled over an appropriate image for the cover of the album, feeling that a portrait reflecting her good fortune was in poor taste. She suggested to Sony Music Entertainment that the album cover not include her picture. However, after much discussion, the photo shoot for A New Day Has Come took place in Montreal in late December 2001 with well-renowned photographer Melvin Sokolsky. On 30 and 31 January 2002 an additional photo session for the album took place in Florida, on a beach near Dion's home by the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier. The album cover for A New Day Has Come by Demarchelier was released on 28 February 2002.|$|E

Among the songs she performed there was [...] "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. [...] She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage.
