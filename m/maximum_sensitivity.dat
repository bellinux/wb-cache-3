40|$|Voigt wave {{propagation}} (VWP) was considered in a porous biaxial dielectric material which was infiltrated with a material of refractive index n_a. The infiltrated material {{was regarded as}} a homogenized composite material in the long-wavelength regime and its constitutive parameters were estimated using the extended Bruggeman homogenization formalism. In our numerical studies, the directions which support VWP were found to vary by as much as 300 ^∘ per RIU as the refractive index n_a was varied. The sensitivities achieved were acutely dependent upon the refractive index n_a and the degrees of anisotropy and dissipation of the porous biaxial material. The orientations, shapes and sizes of the particles which constitute the infiltrating material and the porous biaxial material exerted only a secondary influence on the <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivities</b> achieved. Also, for the parameter ranges considered, the degree of porosity of the biaxial material had little effect on the <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivities</b> achieved. These numerical findings bode well for the possible harnessing of VWP for optical sensing applications...|$|R

[...] It soon became apparent that cosmic ray intensity from the West was significantly larger than that from the East.

At the time, this result was surprising, because most investigators held the preconceived notion that the primaries would be negative electrons.|$|E
500|$|The name Razer Naga is {{believed}} to be based on both the Sanskrit word for [...] "snake" [...] and possibly Naga, a World of Warcraft race. The first Razer Naga was announced at Gamescom 2009 and released in August 2009. The first version of the Naga had a total of seventeen buttons, with twelve being {{on the left side of}} the mouse, and a switch on the underside of the mouse that maps them to the keyboard's top number buttons or its numeric keypad. The original Naga had a <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 5,600 DPI. DPI stands for [...] "dots per inch", and is a unit for measuring the sensitivity of a mouse, with a higher DPI equaling a higher sensitivity. Downloadable software by Razer called AddOns allowed the user to map what each key did. The Naga Epic, which was released in November 2010, was the first installment in the Naga series to have wireless functionality. It was also released with an interchangeable side panel and the ability to change the color of the lights from a pool of sixteen million colors. A redesigned version of the original Naga, called the Naga Molten, was released in early 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice coil winding {{is almost always}} copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost.

While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E

2500|$|The lowest-level {{concepts}} {{related to}} visual perception {{for a human}} being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, {{the structure of the}} retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, [...] "fixes" [...] it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The image [...] "marks time" [...] in the vicinity of this point.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overall goal}} of the matrix {{compound}} is to present the sample to the atom beam at a high mobile surface concentration. For <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> the sample should form a perfect monolayer at {{the surface of a}} substrate having low volatility. This monolayer effect can be seen in that once a certain concentration of analyte in matrix is reached, any concentration above that is seen to exhibit no effect, because once the monlayer is formed, any additional analyte is beneath the monolayer, and thus not affected by the atom beam. The concentration needed to cause this effect is seen to change as the amount of non-volatile matrix changes. So concentration of solid analyte needs to be considered in the preparation of the solution for analysis so that signal from [...] "hidden" [...] analyte is not missed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sensitivities of {{two species}} of sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus and Lepomis cyanellus) to the {{electric}} field (E-vector) of polarized light were assessed by compound action potential recordings from the optic nerve of live fish. Under white light and long wavelength adapting backgrounds, two cone mechanisms were found with <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivities</b> in the long wavelength (λmax ≈ 620 nm) and middle wavelength (λmax ≈ 530 nm) regions of the spectrum. In contrast to previous findings (Cameron and Pugh, 1991), no evidence of polarization sensitivity was observed for either species. We conclude from these results that post-larval sunfish do not exhibit polarization sensitivity. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
