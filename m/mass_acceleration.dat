Existing method of gauging the roughness is based on physical measurements and the instrument is installed under the vehicle, which is expensive and will affect the vehicle dynamic responses. This paper shows an easier method to estimate the road roughness by measuring and calculating the power spectral density (PSD) of unsprung <b>mass</b> <b>accelerations.</b> This approach is possible due {{to the relationship between}} these two via a transfer function. By comparing the power spectral densities of estimated road and the standard classes, we can classify the current road classes easily.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{modification of}} the conventional balance control of semi-active suspension systems aiming at {{the elimination of the}} damping force and consequently sprung <b>mass</b> <b>acceleration</b> discontinuities (dynamic jerk). An analysis {{of the relationship between the}} relative displacement of the sprung mass and the relative velocity between the sprung and unsprung masses shows sudden damping force variations (jumps). Conventional balance control in this way introduces at zero crossings of the relative velocity across the suspension jumps in damping force and consequently sprung <b>mass</b> <b>acceleration</b> jumps. The acceleration jumps cause a significant reduction in isolation benefits of semi-active suspensions in which the conventional balance control is used. The presented {{modification of the}} conventional balance control leads to elimination of the damping force and also sprung <b>mass</b> <b>acceleration</b> jumps as is showed by the results of the numerical simulations.

The novel strategy lies {{in the use of}} sprung <b>mass</b> <b>acceleration</b> and unsprung <b>mass</b> <b>acceleration</b> signals simultaneously, which are easily measured and obtained in engineering practice. Using a quarter-car model as an example, a TAEI PID controller for active suspension is established and its control parameters are optimized based on the genetic algorithm (GA), in which the fitness function is a suspension quadratic performance index. Comparative simulation shows that the proposed TAEI PID controller can achieve better comprehensive performance, stability, and robustness than a conventional single-acceleration-error-input (SAEI) PID controller for the active suspension...|$|E

For controlling semi-active parameters, PID controller has been used. PID controller output is fed to the quarter car setup as a damping coefficient. Thus changing the damping coefficient dynamically as the disturbance occurs, and thus improving the ride comfort.
