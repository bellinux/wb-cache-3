5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The <b>Miami</b> <b>Herald</b> declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E

5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The <b>Miami</b> <b>Herald,</b> Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs.

Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
