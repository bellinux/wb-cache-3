5000|$|Entreri reveals {{little about}} his past, but some {{is known about}} his early life. Artemis Entreri was born into the streets of Memnon, to a prostitute named Shanali, he was {{constantly}} abused by his [...] "father," [...] Belrigger, and his uncle, Tosso-posh. Eventually, his mother sold him to a pedophile merchant who was, if anything, worse than his uncle; it's speculated that it was through the depraved merchant's travels is how Entreri reached Calimport. This betrayal was enough to put a block on Entreri's emotions, making the man hide from the world by a sheer mental wall of anger and cynicism. In Calimport, he was taken in by the thieves' guild ruled by Pasha Basadoni. Basadoni taught young Artemis the tricks of the trade, teaching him the basics of fighting, and helping him master stealth. As Entreri practiced, he flourished, becoming the most efficient and deadly assassin in Calimshan and perhaps all of Faerûn. He was hired by many Pashas, his <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>employer</b> being Pasha Pook. Pasha Pook hired Artemis to track down a halfling named Regis who had stolen an enchanted ruby from Pook. Entreri would chase Regis for several years, each time with Regis only escaping by a hair's breadth. Entreri eventually cornered Regis in the far north at the Spine of the World.|$|R

30|$|We {{observe that}} some of these errors can be {{corrected}} with the help of job posting data since the main jobs posted by an employer often relate to its industry. For example, truck driver jobs often correspond to employers that belong to transportation industry. When we look at the jobs posted by the <b>employer</b> <b>named</b> “First Transit,” the titles of the jobs posted include “Shuttle Driver,” “Bus Operator,” “Automotive Technician”. By looking at these job titles, we can see that they belong to the Transportation domain. Also, the word “Transit” in the <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> is a good indicator that the employer industry is Transportation. <b>Employers</b> <b>named</b> “Fresenius Medical Care,” “Community Health Systems, Inc.” contain keywords “medical”, “health” and belong to the Health Care industry.|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} system at CareerBuilder 2 uses an <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system [14, 15, 16] and an employer knowledge base (KB) to infer the employer industry of a job. The <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system normalizes <b>employer</b> <b>names</b> and links {{them to an}} employer entity in the KB. The employer KB contains an industry attribute for each employer entity. However, errors may occur during the computation of the job employer and {{in the construction of}} the employer KB with the industry attributes. For example, the industry of the employer “First Transit” should be Transportation, but is incorrectly labeled as “Office Administrative Services” in the KB. The KB is huge with about 20 M entities, and hence, it is not possible to manually detect the errors.|$|R
30|$|In {{a similar}} way, for each {{industry}} i, we generate a vocabulary V_ni of keywords present in <b>employer</b> <b>names.</b> There {{are two types}} of <b>employer</b> names: Unnormalized <b>Names</b> and Normalized Names. Unnormalized Names are the raw names (mentions) of an employer extracted from the job postings. These names are then given as input to the normalization system and are mapped to entities in the <b>employer</b> KB. The <b>name</b> of this normalized entity is called the Normalized <b>Name.</b> By <b>employer</b> <b>name,</b> we refer to the set of all Unnormalized Names and the Normalized <b>Name</b> of an <b>employer.</b> For each industry, we define a significance score for the unigrams present in the <b>employer</b> <b>names.</b> Then to form the vocabulary of keywords for that industry, we select those unigrams that have their significance score and frequency greater than certain thresholds. The thresholds for V_ni are chosen in a similar way as for how we compute V_ti and V_di. Table  2 shows the size of V_ni and some example keywords in V_ni for a few industries.|$|R
