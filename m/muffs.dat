5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear <b>muffs.</b> Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or <b>muffs.</b> The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, <b>muffs,</b> jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "sustained grind" [...] of the Big <b>Muff</b> {{was later}} an {{integral}} part of the sound of many alternative rock bands through the 1980s and 1990s, being used extensively by The Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr., NOFX, Bush and Mudhoney. The name of the pedal even inspired the title of Mudhoney's 1988 debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff. Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth used the Sovtek version of the Big <b>Muff.</b> [...] And more recently Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who often uses the Sovtek version in a number of The Black Keys songs.Aside from the Big <b>Muff,</b> Electro-Harmonix have made the Nano <b>Muff,</b> the Metal <b>Muff,</b> which has a 3-band EQ and is a distortion; the Little Big <b>Muff,</b> a smaller variation of the current NYC model, the Deluxe Big <b>Muff,</b> the 77/78 op-amp Big <b>Muff,</b> designed by Howard Davis, which uses IC's to create the Fuzz whereas all others, except the Deluxe Big <b>Muff,</b> use transistors. There also exists a customized limited edition Big <b>Muff,</b> called the Mogwai Big <b>Muff.</b> This pedal was designed for the Scottish band Mogwai, and has a slightly more extreme sound. Electro-Harmonix produced only one hundred Mogwai Big <b>Muff</b> pedals.|$|R

25|$|Although a furbearer, the wildcat's skin is {{of little}} {{commercial}} value, due to the unattractive colour of its natural state, and the difficulties present in dyeing it. In the former Soviet Union, the fur of a forest wildcat usually fetched 50 kopecks, while that of a steppe wildcat fetched 60 kopecks. Wildcat skin is almost solely used for making cheap scarfs, <b>muffs,</b> and women's coats. It is sometimes converted into imitation sealskin. As a rule, wildcat fur is difficult to dye in dark brown or black, and {{has a tendency to}} turn green when the dye is not well settled into the hair. When dye is overly applied, wildcat fur is highly susceptible to singeing.|$|E
25|$|Concerned by {{the poor}} start in the Warwick, Waller decided to add ear <b>muffs</b> to Winx's racing {{equipment}} to help her relax – she had always worn them during trackwork but previously had them removed in the parade ring before racing. She made her next start on 2 September in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick. This time she broke well and settled {{near the front of}} the main pack. On the lead, Red Excitement set a quick pace and opened up a large lead of five lengths to the second place horse, who in turn was over five lengths in front of Winx. Turning into the stretch, Winx moved into second but still had five lengths to make up on Red Excitement with 450m remaining. At the 200m mark, she still had three lengths to make up when Bowman dropped the whip. Under a hand ride, Winx continued to close ground and pulled clear in the final strides to win by a length.|$|E

500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The <b>Muffs,</b> and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ...

500|$|The koala {{was heavily}} hunted by European {{settlers}} in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, <b>muffs,</b> and as trimming on women's garments. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing {{in a letter to}} The Courier-Mail, expressed the popular sentiment: [...] "The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account... He affords no sport to the gun-man... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas." [...] Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month open season in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.|$|E

5000|$|The Big <b>Muff</b> Pi was {{the first}} {{overwhelming}} success for Electro-Harmonix's line of pedals. Due to its reliability, its low price and its distinctive sound, the Big <b>Muff</b> sold consistently through the 1970s and was found in innumerable guitarists' pedal collections. For example, David Gilmour and Carlos Santana (although Santana owned one it is reported he did not use it) were some of first famous users of the pedal. David Gilmour famously used the Big <b>Muff</b> on the Pink Floyd albums Animals and The Wall and most recently on his 2006 On An Island tour. Other artists who used the Big <b>Muff</b> during the 1970s include Thin Lizzy, Kiss, Frank Zappa (though Zappa had it modified to produce a very non-typical Big <b>Muff</b> distortion), and Ronnie Montrose. Even after the Electro-Harmonix company was forced {{out of business in}} 1982, the pedal remained in such demand that clones of the Big <b>Muff</b> were made by both competing corporations and independent pedal builders, and demand for [...] "vintage Big Muffs" [...] rose. Unsurprisingly, when Matthews restarted Electro-Harmonix in the 1990s, the Big <b>Muff</b> {{was one of the first}} pedals he reintroduced to the market.|$|R

6000|$|There are <b>muffs</b> in this world. I do {{not refer}} to those hairy {{articles}} of female apparel in which ladies are wont to place their hands, handkerchiefs, and scent-bottles. Although not given {{to the use of}} slang, I avail myself of it on this occasion, the word [...] "muff" [...] being eminently expressive of a certain class of boys, big as well as little, old as well as young. There are three distinct classes of boys--namely, <b>muffs,</b> sensible fellows, and boasters. I say there are three distinct classes, but I do not say that every boy belongs to one or other of those classes. Those who have studied chemistry know that nature's elements are few. Nearly all kinds of matter, and certainly all varieties of mind, are composite. There are no pure and simple <b>muffs.</b> Most boasters have {{a good deal of the}} muff in them, and many <b>muffs</b> are boasters; while sensible fellows are occasionally tinged with a dash of both the bad qualities--they are, if I may be allowed to coin a word, sensible-boasto-muffers!
