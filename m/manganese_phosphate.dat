5|$|The {{manganese}} content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.|$|E
25|$|Lithium iron {{phosphate}} (LiFePO4) is a {{class of}} cathode materials used in lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the auto industry. Valence Technologies produce a lithium iron <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> (LiFeMnPO4) battery with LG Chem selling lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries for the Chevy Volt and A123 produces a lithium nano-phosphate battery. The most important merit of this battery type is safety and high-power. Lithium iron phosphate batteries are one of three major types in LFP family, the other two being nano-phosphate and nano-cocrystalline-olivine.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} water contribution to mineral nutrients intake is also unclear. Inorganic minerals generally enter surface water and ground water via storm water runoff {{or through the}} Earth's crust. Treatment processes also lead {{to the presence of}} some minerals. Examples include calcium, zinc, <b>manganese,</b> <b>phosphate,</b> fluoride and sodium compounds. Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals, but provides {{only a small fraction of}} a human's necessary intake. There are a variety of trace elements present in virtually all potable water, some of which play a role in metabolism. For example, sodium, potassium and chloride are common chemicals found in small quantities in most waters, and these elements play a role in body metabolism. Other elements such as fluoride, while beneficial in low concentrations, can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Manganese has no {{satisfactory}} substitute in {{its major}} applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating),</b> zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.|$|R
50|$|Zinc {{phosphating}} {{results in}} a non-reflective, light- to medium-gray finish. <b>Manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> produces a medium- to dark-gray or black finish. Iron phosphating produces a black or dark gray finish similar to <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating.</b> The grain size of the zinc phosphating is usually the smallest among the three processes, providing a more appealing cosmetic appearance in many applications. Some parkerized guns, particularly of WWII vintage, have almost OD green color. This was caused by contaminants in the acid solution and not cosmoline as is commonly believed.|$|R
50|$|Colquhoun of the Parker Rust-Proof Phosphating Company of America then filed another {{improved}} phosphating {{patent application}} in 1919. This patent was issued in 1919 as , for an improved <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> (Parkerizing) technique.|$|R

50|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{can also}} be used for {{coatings}} (which are processed as described above). These coatings are useful for protection against corrosion and wear over time, due to their toughness. <b>Manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> coating can often be found in the oil and gas industry, firearms and ordnance, aerospace, gears and bearings, and in marine equipment. They are also common in engines, screws, nuts and bolts, and washers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> (Parkerizing), {{even with}} these process improvements, still {{required}} the use of expensive and difficult-to-obtain manganese compounds. Subsequently, an alternative technique {{was developed by the}} Parker Company to utilize easier-to-obtain compounds at less expense through using zinc phosphating (Parkerizing) in place of <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> (Parkerizing). The patent for this zinc phosphating (Parkerizing) process (utilizing strategic compounds that would remain available in America during a war) was granted to inventor Romig of the American Chemical Paint Company in 1938 as , just prior to the loss of easy access to manganese compounds that occurred during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|An {{improved}} {{patent application}} for <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> based {{in large part}} on this early British iron phosphating process was filed in the US in 1912, and issued in 1913 to Frank Rupert Granville Richards as [...]|$|R
25|$|Reports also mention such {{sources as}} {{contaminated}} drinking water, and fuel additive {{methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl}} (MMT), which on combustion becomes partially converted into <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphates</b> and sulfate that go airborne with the exhaust, and manganese ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (Maneb), a pesticide.|$|R
50|$|Purpurite is a mineral, <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate,</b> MnPO4 {{with varying}} amounts of iron {{depending}} upon its source. Like many manganese-containing minerals, it {{is a striking}} pink purple color.|$|E
50|$|Manganese(II) {{phosphate}} is an {{inorganic compound}} with the chemical formula Mn3(PO4)2. It is a rarely studied species {{in contrast to}} the related lithium <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate,</b> which has been investigated as a battery cathode.|$|E
50|$|Hureaulite is a <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{with the}} formula Mn2+5(PO3OH)2(PO4)2·4H2O. It was {{discovered}} in 1825 and named in 1826 for the type locality, Les Hureaux, Saint-Sylvestre, Haute-Vienne, Limousin, France. It is sometimes written as huréaulite, but the IMA does not recommend this for English language text.|$|E
50|$|Mali is {{endowed with}} bauxite, copper, diamonds, gold, Granite, gypsum, iron ore, kaolin, limestone, lithium, <b>manganese,</b> <b>phosphates,</b> salt, silver, uranium, and zinc. Not all {{deposits}} are being exploited, and some {{may not be}} commercially viable. Mali also has ample hydropower.|$|R
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> is {{used for}} rust and {{corrosion}} prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, Baker and Dingman of the Parker Rust-Proof Company {{filed an}} {{improved}} <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> (Parkerizing) process patent in 1928 that reduced the processing time to [...] {{of the original}} time that had been required through heating the solution to a temperature in the precisely controlled range of 500 to 550 F. This patent was issued as [...] in 1930.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} KBD remains controversial. Studies of the {{pathogenesis}} and {{risk factors of}} KBD have proposed selenium deficiency, inorganic (<b>manganese,</b> <b>phosphate...)</b> and organic matter (humic and fulvic acids) in drinking water, fungi on self-produced storage grain (Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp.), producing trichotecene (T2) mycotoxins.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of phosphate coatings {{makes use of}} phosphoric acid and {{takes advantage of the}} low solubility of phosphates in medium or high pH solutions. Iron, zinc or <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> salts are dissolved in a solution of phosphoric acid. When steel or iron parts are placed in the phosphoric acid, a classic acid and metal reaction takes place which locally depletes the hydronium (H3O+) ions, raising the pH, and causing the dissolved salt to fall out of solution and be precipitated on the surface. The acid and metal reaction also creates iron phosphate locally which may also be deposited. In the case of depositing zinc phosphate or <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> the additional iron phosphate is frequently an undesirable addition to the coating.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon is}} similar to the Tanfoglio variant of the Czech CZ-75, with design {{elements}} borrowed from the SIG P210, though few of its parts are interchangeable with the Tanfoglio weapon from whose machining dies and blue prints it was derived. It has a hot forged steel frame mated to a heavy milled slide treated with <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and coated in heat-cured epoxy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>{{phosphates}}</b> often {{combine with}} iron phosphates through paragenesis. [...] In {{the process of}} paragenesis, each mineral affects {{the manner in which}} the other is crystallized. The minerals combine in isomorphic series, meaning that they crystallize in similar forms, producing a sequence of solids. Some examples of “isomorphic series” formed by Mn and Fe include heterosite (Fe,Mn)PO4, purpurite (Mn,Fe)PO4, and triplite (Mn,Fe)PO4..|$|R
50|$|Lithiophylite is a {{resinous}} reddish to {{yellowish brown}} mineral crystallizing in the orthorhombic system often as slender prisms. It is {{usually associated with}} lepidolite, beryl, quartz, albite, amblygonite, and spodumene of pegmatitic origin. It rather readily weathers {{to a variety of}} secondary <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphates</b> and oxides. It is a late-stage mineral in some complex granite pegmatites. Members of the triphylite-lithiophilite series readily alter to secondary minerals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manganese,</b> <b>phosphate,</b> iron, and lithium also form an olivine {{structure}}. This {{structure is}} a very useful contributor to the cathode of lithium rechargeable batteries. This {{is due to the}} olivine structure created when lithium is combined with manganese, iron, and phosphate (as described above). The olivine structures of lithium rechargeable batteries are significant, for they are affordable, stable, and can be safely stored as energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to degrease and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> coating is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|E
50|$|Several Indian {{companies}} have investments in Peru's mining sector including iron ore, <b>manganese,</b> <b>phosphate</b> and gold. IFFCO owns a major stake in large phosphate mine in northern Peru, Zuari Agro has a 30% stake (worth about $36 million) {{in a rock}} phosphate reserve in the same region. Reliance acquired an oil block in the country. Several Indian IT firms also operate in Peru. Tata Consultancy Services operates in Lima, and Tech Mahindra began operating in the country after it acquired Israeli company LeadCom.|$|E

50|$|Parkerizing, bonderizing, phosphating, or {{phosphatizing}} is {{a method}} of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear {{through the application of}} a chemical phosphate conversion coating. Parkerizing is usually considered to be an improved zinc or <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphating</b> process, and not to be an improved iron phosphating process, although some use the term parkerizing as a generic term for applying phosphating (or phosphatizing) coatings that does include the iron phosphating process.|$|R

50|$|Waterhouseite, Mn7(PO4)2(OH)8, is a hydroxy <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate</b> mineral. It is a medium-soft, brittle mineral {{occurring}} in pseudo-orthorhombic monoclinic bladed crystals and orange-brown to dark brown in color. Waterhouseite {{is on the}} softer side with a Mohs hardness of 4, has a specific gravity of 3.5 and a yellowish-brown streak. It is named after Frederick George Waterhouse, first director of the South Australian Museum, as well as recognizes the work Waterhouse Club has done {{in support of the}} South Australian Museum.|$|E
50|$|Switzer {{also worked}} with other {{scientists}} to identify and name five minerals, which were all new to science, during his career. In his honor, three prominent mineralogists - Peter B. Leavens, John S. White and Pier F. Zanazzi - proposed naming a mineral after Switzer. The mineral in question consisted of pale brown crystals, composed of <b>manganese</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and was first discovered in North Carolina. In 1967 the International Mineralogical Association approved the name designation switzerite, in honor of George Switzer.|$|E

40|$|As {{with most}} mining activities, the mining of <b>manganese</b> and <b>phosphate</b> has serious {{consequences}} for the environment. Despite a largely adequate and progressive framework for environmental governance developed since 1994, few mines have integrated systems into their supply chain processes to minimise environmental risks and ensure the achievement of acceptable standards. Indeed, few mines {{have been able to}} implement green supply chain management (GrSCM). The purpose of this article was to explore challenges related to the implementation of GrSCM and to provide insight into how GrSCM can be implemented in the South African <b>manganese</b> and <b>phosphate</b> industry. This article reported findings of a qualitative study involving interviews with 12 participants from the <b>manganese</b> and <b>phosphate</b> industry in South Africa. Purposive sampling techniques were used. Emerging from the study were six themes, all of which were identified as key challenges in the implementation of GrSCM in the <b>manganese</b> and <b>phosphate</b> mining industry. From the findings, these challenges include the operationalisation of environmental issues, lack of collaboration and knowledge sharing, proper application of monitoring and control systems,lack of clear policy and legislative direction, the cost of implementing GrSCM practices, and the need for strong leadership and management of change. On the basis of the literature reviewed and empirical findings, conclusions were drawn and policy and management recommendations were accordingly made...|$|R
