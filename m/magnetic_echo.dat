40|$|We {{propose the}} use of the gyrotropic motion of vortex cores in nanomagnets to produce a <b>magnetic</b> <b>echo,</b> {{analogous}} to the spin echo in NMR. This echo occurs when an array of nanomagnets, e. g., nanodisks, is magnetized with an in-plane (xy) field, and after a time τ a field pulse inverts the core magnetization; the echo is a peak in M_xy at t= 2 τ. Its relaxation times depend on the inhomogeneity, on the interaction between the nanodots and on the Gilbert damping constant α. Its feasibility is demonstrated using micromagnetic simulation. To illustrate an application of the echoes, we have determined the inhomogeneity and measured the magnetic interaction in an array of nanodisks separated by a distance d, finding a d^-n dependence, with n≈ 4.

40|$|The Osbourn Trough is a 900 km long, east-west {{trending}} gravity low, {{visible in}} satellite altimetry data, which intersects the Tonga Trench at 25 ◦ 30 ’S. A recent survey collected gravity, <b>magnetic,</b> <b>echo</b> sounder, and swath bathymetry data on three adjacent, north-south trending ship tracks {{centered on the}} trough. The linear gravity low is 20 – 30 mGal less than the regional value and {{is accompanied by a}} flat-lying, 200 – 500 m deep sediment-filled valley. Swath bathymetry images reveal several parallel, east-west trending linear ridges and valleys {{on either side of the}} main trough as well as other morphologic features characteristic of relict spreading centers, including a prominent inside corner high and possible pseudo-fault trace. The presence of magnetic anomalies (possibly anomalies 33 and 32) suggests that the seafloor here was formed after the end of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (anomaly 34). These data support the conclusion that this trough is a spreading center, which stopped spreading in Late Cretaceous time. The existence of this feature has important implications for tectonic reconstructions in this region. The Osbourn Trough could be part of the fossil spreading center between the Pacific Plate and a fragment of the Phoenix Plate, the Bellingshausen Plate. This would require the seafloor between the Osbourn Trough and the Chatham Rise to the south to be a remnant fragment of the Bellingshausen Plate. This remnant may have joined to the Pacific Plate when the Hikurangi Plateau entered the Gondwana subduction zone at the Chatham Rise possibly causing the cessation of spreading on the Osbourn Trough. 11 - 24 ˚- 25...|$|E

For this reason, {{the mechanism of}} this interaction and its dependence with distance d between these nanoobjects {{has been the subject}} of several recent studies. In the present work, the problem of the interaction between magnetic nanodisks with magnetic vortex structures is treated both analytically and through micromagnetic simulation. The coupling of two magnetic nanodisks is obtained, in the case of nanodisks with different gyrotropic frequencies. The motion of the two vortex cores, and consequently the time dependence of the total magnetization M(t) is derived using Thiele's equation and by simulation. The magnetic coupling strength as a function of the distance between the disks of each pair is computed with a recently developed method, using the <b>magnetic</b> vortex <b>echoes,</b> analogous to the NMR spin echoes.

40|$|Purpose: In 3 D {{gradient}} <b>echo</b> <b>magnetic</b> {{resonance imaging}} (MRI), strong field gradients B 0 (macro) are visually observed at air/tissue interfaces. At low spatial resolution in particular, the respective field gradients {{lead to an}} apparent increase in intravoxel dephasing, and subsequently, to signal loss or inaccurate R- 2 * estimates. If the strong field gradients are measured, their influence can be removed by postprocessing. Methods: Conventional corrections usually assume a linear phase evolution with time. For high macroscopic gradient inhomogeneities {{near the edge of}} the brain and at the paranasal sinuses, however, this assumption is often broken. Herein, we explored a novel model that considers both linear and stochastic dependences of the phase evolution with echo time in the presence of weak and strong macroscopic field inhomogeneities. We tested the performance of the model at large field gradients using simulation, phantom, and human in vivo studies. Results: The performance of the proposed approach was markedly better than the standard correction method, providing a correction equivalent to that of the conventional approach in regions with high signal to noise ratio (SNR > 10), but appearing more robust in regions with low SNR (SNR < 4).

Host carbogen breathing increased both arterial blood pCO 2 and pO 2, but decreased blood pH. A fourfold increase in tumour pO 2 (measured polarographically) and a twofold increase in image intensity [measured by gradient recalled <b>echo</b> <b>magnetic</b> resonance (MR) imaging sensitive to changes in oxy/deoxyhaemoglobin] were observed.

The improvement in energy status of the tumour was reflected in changes in tissue ions, including Na+, through ionic equilibria.
