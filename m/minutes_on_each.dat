5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{have been}} reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. With pine trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. A cockatoo spends about twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> pine cone.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, BART {{had envisioned}} {{frequent}} local service, with headways {{as short as}} two minutes between trains on the quadruple-interlined section in San Francisco and six <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> individual line. However, headways have fallen short of the original plans. While trains do arrive every three minutes on the quadruple-interlined section between West Oakland and Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side, {{but most of}} the boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

25|$|PATH {{operates}} 24hours a day, {{seven days}} a week. During weekday hours, PATH operates four train services, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. Each line is represented by a unique color, which also corresponds {{to the color of}} the lights {{on the front of the}} trains. The Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (orange and blue), since it is a late-night hours combination of the Journal Square – 33rd Street and Hoboken – 33rd Street services. During peak hours, trains operate every four to eight <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> service. Every PATH station except Newark and Harrison is served by a train every two to three minutes, for a peak-hour service of 20 to 30 trains per hour.|$|E
2500|$|The 29th and 4th {{divisions}} were {{to advance}} east {{across the valley}} of Beaumont-Hamel to intermediate line on Beaucourt spur and then advance to the second position in [...] hours. British artillery fire would lift off the German front trench at zero hour and the field artillery was to move eastwards in six lifts, off the first objective [...] after zero and then lift in succession after about twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> of the further objectives, the heavy artillery lifting five minutes earlier each time. The divisional field artillery was to lift for [...] as each infantry advance began and then move east at [...] per minute. Each division was to reserve two 18-pounder batteries ready to advance at short notice and visual signalling, runners, flares, signals to contact patrol aircraft, wide-angle signalling lamps were provided. Bombers (hand-grenade specialists in the infantry) carried flags to mark the front line.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Rendell , engineer, deposed that he {{constructed}} the present steam ferry boats or bridges at the Hamoaze. These were worked by chains, which extended to either shore; and when wind and tide was strong, the chains formed {{a species of}} arc, and the platform [...] was not {{at right angles with}} the landing place. Considerable difficulty would therefore arise in bringing the rails of the bridge so immediately in contact with the rails of the landing place, [...] that the trains might easily and safely run on and off the bridge; besides that, a difficulty arose from the great fall in the tide, which at spring was no less than 18feet. [...] was of opinion that by a train being stopped, divided, and placed upon the steam bridge, and landed {{on the opposite side of}} the Hamoaze, tackled together, and put in motion, a great delay would be occasioned, independent of the seven or eight minutes in crossing, of from eight to twelve <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side.|$|E

2500|$|According to Chuck D, Hank Shocklee {{made the}} last call when songs were completed. [...] "Hank {{would come up}} with the final mix because he was the sound master... Hank is the Phil Spector of hip-hop. He was way ahead of his time, because he dared to {{challenge}} the odds in sound." [...] This {{was also one of the}} details which Chuck felt to be unique to the time and recording of the album. [...] "Once hip-hop became corporate, they took the daredevil out of the artistry. But being a daredevil was what Hank brought to the table." [...] It was decided amongst the group that the album should be exactly one hour long, thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side. At the time, audio cassettes were more popular than CD's and the group didn't want listeners having to hear dead air for a long time after one-half of the album was finished. The two sides of the album were originally the other way around, the album beginning with [...] "Show Em Whatcha Got" [...] which leads into [...] "She Watch Channel Zero?!". This instead became the start of side two or the [...] "Black Side". Hank Shocklee decided to flip the sides just before the mastering of the album and start the record with Dave Pearce introducing the group during their first tour of England.|$|E

5000|$|Eleven @ 11:00 is {{the title}} of the 11:00 p.m. {{newscast}} on many local television stations in the United States. The name is {{based on the fact that}} the newscast will run for at least eleven minutes before the first commercial break, a summarized weather forecast segment will air during that time, or the top local and regional and/or national news headlines (sometimes themed to spend a <b>minute</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> story as a countdown of the day's most important stories) will run in the first eleven minutes of the newscast, or in a few cases, provide alliteration in newscast titling for a station which is on Channel 11. By contrast, the traditional newscast format has the opening segment (or [...] "A-block") lasting only 7-8 minutes long; however this has expanded in some local news formats to 8-10 <b>minutes</b> depending <b>on</b> the market outside of the [...] "Eleven @ 11" [...] format due to competition.|$|R

Rominger was able to gain almost a <b>minute</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> of the main general classification contenders including Piotr Ugrumov and Evgeni Berzin. The third stage was Cipollini's second stage victory as he won the bunch sprint. The fourth stage was contested on a set circuit that was covered four times.

50|$|But {{nearly all}} of the {{programs}} being recorded ran for only fifteen or thirty minutes, and rarely for more than one hour.

It would also require having somebody available every fifteen minutes to set up and execute each transcription, and to perform this task a somewhat daunting seventy-six consecutive times over a nineteen-hour period.|$|E
50|$|Forty {{steam and}} internal-combustion {{locomotives}} were {{used on the}} island. These were imported from Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA including three 70 ton geared Shay locomotives, a type of locomotive predominantly used within the USA. According to the time table, the Shay locomotives needed 2 hours per trip, requiring 20-30 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> journey for refuelling with wood and water.

50|$|Green (unripe) plantains are peeled, sliced length-wise, diagonally, or width-wise, {{and then}} fried twice. The raw slices of plantains are fried {{for one to}} two <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side until they are golden in color, and removed and patted to remove excess cooking oil. Afterwards, they are pounded flat with a hinged utensil made for the task, called a tostonera, or less {{conveniently}} with any kitchen utensil that has a large enough flat surface, for instance between two plates. The flattened plantain slices are then fried once again until they are crisp and golden brown.|$|E
