5|$|At this point, {{the roadway}} loops around itself at a {{section in the}} roadway locally known as The Helix, {{descending}} the New Jersey Palisades to reach {{the entrance to the}} Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River.

After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road features an eastbound toll plaza and enters the Lincoln Tunnel.

5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near <b>Midtown</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and <b>Midtown</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and considered the front-runner in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a <b>midtown</b> <b>Manhattan</b> hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, the case against him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying to a grand jury about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian dignitary. Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E

At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson River in Hudson County).|$|E

5|$|In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna was {{combined}} {{with several other}} railroads to create the Consolidated Rail Corporation, who continued maintenance of the New Jersey and New York Line {{for the next seven}} years, until the newly formed New Jersey Transit took over the station in 1983. On March 17, 1984, the station building, now 114 years old, was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and by that June, the station was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The station building was restored in 2001 by contractors from Jablonski Building Conservation Incorporated in <b>Midtown</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> who had experience restoring train stations. The building conservation repainted the old station's wooden siding yellow and the bay windows to a brand new brown on the station's ground-level platform.|$|E

5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd StreetâSoutheast Queens line, which would stretch {{from the existing}} 57th Street subway station in <b>Midtown</b> <b>Manhattan</b> to the existing Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens. The construction of this line was to be split up into three parts. The first part, Route 131âA, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131âB, the SuperâExpress Bypass Line, would continue along the LIRR right-of-way to Forest Hills. And finally, Route 131âD, the Southeastern Queens Line, would build {{a branch of the}} Queens Boulevard Line at Briarwood through Downtown Jamaica to Springfield Gardens via the LIRR's Atlantic Branch, with a ramp to eliminate the Jamaica Avenue elevated structure in Downtown Jamaica.|$|E
