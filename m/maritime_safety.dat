At {{the time of the}} agency's creation, the search effort involved China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States as well as several agencies of the Australian government: the Australian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Safety</b> Authority (AMSA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the Department of Defence, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The search activities also involved analysis of the flight's satellite communications by Inmarsat, the AAIB (UK), the NTSB (US), and other organisations.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} corridor {{was soon}} discounted {{and the focus}} of the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia and within Australia's concurrent aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) regions that extend to 75°E longitude. On 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean; the Australian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Safety</b> Authority (AMSA), Australia's search and rescue agency, initially coordinated the search within Australia's SAR region, correlating information with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and officials in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations. For the following six weeks, the Australian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Safety</b> Authority (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), Inmarsat (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, <b>maritime</b> <b>safety,</b> environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
