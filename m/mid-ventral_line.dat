60|$|Section 84. The {{pelvic girdle}} {{differs from the}} {{pectoral}} in most land vertebrata in being articulated with the vertebral column. This difference {{does not exist in}} fishes. It consist in the rabbit of four bones; the ilium (i.), the ischium (is.), the pubis (pb.), and the small cotyloid bone-- the first two and the latter one meeting in the acetabular fossa (ac.) in which the head of the femur works. The pubes and ischia are fused along the <b>mid-ventral</b> <b>line.</b> Many morphologists regard, the ilium as equivalent to, that is, strictly corresponding in its relation, to the scapula, the pubis to the cartilaginous substratum of the clavicle, and the ischium to the coracoid.|$|E
60|$|First Dissection.-- Pin out {{the frog}} in a {{dissecting}} dish, ventral surface uppermost, {{and cover with}} water. Open up the skin along the <b>mid-ventral</b> <b>line.</b> Note the large sub-cutaneous lymph spaces, the pelvic and pectoral girdles, and the anterior abdominal vein. Cut into the body cavity {{on one side of}} this latter, cut across in front of where the vein dips down to liver, and peel the body wall away from it. The xiphisternum will probably be cut in this operation. In early spring the females are greatly distended with ova, and the greater portion of the ovary may, with advantage, be removed. The oviduct is dead white then, and larger and much more in evidence than the (pinkish) intestine even. Turn over the viscera, and compare with Sheet 11; one lung is often found greatly inflated, and then projects back into the body cavity; the stomach is, in some cases, pushed forward and hidden behind the shoulder girdle. Observe the allantoic bladder, the spleen, gall bladder, portal vein, and pancreas. By squeezing the gall bladder gently, the bile duct will be injected with bile, and will be apparent if the stomach is turned over. The oesophagus, {{just in front of the}} stomach, should be cut through, and the rectum, and the mesentery and alimentary canal supported by it, removed. This will expose the urogenital organs. (Vide Figures given.) These vary greatly, especially in the females, at different seasons. The condition figured would be seen in late autumn, or winter. In spring females are often found copulating with males, and then the ovary itself is inconspicuous, while the lower part of the oviduct is enormously distended with ova, so as to be mistaken sometimes for the ovary by those who fail to note that the ova are enclosed by a thin semi-transparent skin (wall of oviduct). The vena cava inferior is seen between the kidneys and the renal portal vein beside the ureter. Cutting through the mesentery supporting the kidney laterally, the dorsal aorta is exposed, and on either side of it the sympathetic chain and rami communicantes, often tinged with black pigment. This black pigment is a frequent but variable feature of the frog's anatomy, and usually dapples or blackens the testes, and also sometimes darkens the otherwise pale pink arteries. Behind the kidneys the sciatic plexus also becomes visible. Careful drawings should be made. Cut off the head of the frog, shave off top of brain case, and put the head in strong spirit.|$|E

40|$|A thin band of re£ecting {{platelets}} overlies {{the central}} {{parts of the}} light and dark stripes found {{on each side of}} the dorsal surfaces of the body of the mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.). When this ¢sh has its antero-posterior axis horizontal and its mid-dorsal and <b>mid-ventral</b> <b>lines</b> in the same vertical plane,V, the surfaces of the re£ecting platelets in these bands are within a few degrees of being vertical. These surfaces are, however, tipped about 178 from plane V towards the tail. In the angular distributions of radiance commonly found in the sea, the re£ections from these bands can mask parts of the pattern of light and dark stripes seen by neighbours in ways that depend on the orientation of the ¢sh in the external light ¢eld and the position of the ¢sh relative to its neighbours. With this arrangement, when the ¢sh changes its orientation and/or its velocity with respect to neighbouring ¢sh, this is signalled to its neighbours as changes in the patterns of brightness of its dorsal surfaces. Relatively small changes in roll, pitch and yaw can produce large changes in appearance and, as vision is a most important sense in the mackerel, it seems likely that these changes are important for signalling...|$|R
40|$|The worms are slender, elongate, and [...] {{somewhat}} flattened dorsoventrally. The {{dimensions of}} fifteen "in toto" mounts are 1. 55 - 2. 36 mm. long. and 0. 26 - 0. 24 mm. broad, but living specimens are narrower and one and a. half {{times as long}} as fixed specimens. The body is broadest at its middle length and tapers towards the extremities (Fig. 1). It is narrowest immediately behind the crown of the rhynchus. The latter is hemispherical and bears two papillae anteriorly (Piga). (These papillae do not represent contracted tentacles {{as is the case}} in some members of the Bucephalidaes as they are seen only when the animal is extended and are not noticeable in fixed specimens). The rhynchus is notable in that it is armed with a single circlet of spindle-shaped spines, which are eighteen in number and measure 0. 44 mm. long and 0. 012 mm. in diameter. The circlet is interrupted in the <b>mid-ventral</b> <b>line</b> (Figs. 1 - 2). The body is covered hy'a thick cuticle with minute spinules 0. 012 mm. long closely arranged in transverse rows. The rhynchus is free from these spinules except within the ventral break in the circlet of spines. The mouth is situated on the ventral surface, at about the middle length of the body when contracted, but at the junction of the second and last thirds of the body when extended.

40|$|Anatomical {{studies on}} the {{arterial}} supply of the stomach of the rabbit are necessary to know the pattern of its blood supply to gain information {{in the interest of}} experimental surgery, pharmacology and toxicology which can be applied to domestic animals and human. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present investigation was carried out on 20 adult healthy Baladi rabbits of either sex. The animals were collected from several farms at Beni-Suef Governorate. Immediately after slaughtering of rabbits, thorough washing was done with normal saline solution via the thoracic part of the aorta. Then gum milk latex colored red with carmine was injected via the thoracic aorta just prior to its passage through the hiatus aorticus of the diaphragm.

40|$|A multi-year {{cooperative}} project {{between the}} Bonneville Power Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service was initiated in 1983 {{to evaluate the}} potential of the Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag for marking salmonids. The second year 2 ̆ 7 s work had three phases. The objective of Phase I was to evaluate fish tagging with PIT tags. Phases II and III were concerned with the automatic monitoring of juvenile and adult fish injected with PIT tags. In Phase I, sham PIT tags were injected into the body cavity of juvenile salmonids. Tagged fish ranged in weight from 0. 8 to 43. 9 g. Observations based on six tests, ranging in time from 19 to 99 days, indicated that the best site for injecting the tag was along the <b>mid-ventral</b> <b>line</b> {{in the area of the}} pectoral or pelvic fins. Potential advantages to tagging the fish in the area of the pectoral fins were noted. As tagging techniques improved, tag retention of 99...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The metathoracic {{scent gland}} {{system is a}} basic feature of the order Heteroptera. It occurs widely {{not only in the}} {{terrestrial}} forms (Geocorisae) and water‐surface bugs (Amphibicorisae) but also in the totally aquatic bugs (Hydrocorisae) and their littoral relatives (Ochteridae, Gelastocoridae). In Hydrocorisae the metathoracic scent gland conforms to Carayon 2 ̆ 7 s (1971) omphalian type (orifice median and undivided or, if divided, orifices close together towards the <b>mid‐ventral</b> <b>line)</b> but shows marked differences in structure and physiological function between species from different families. There is taxonomic interest in the distribution of the three distinctly different types of metathoracic occlusion apparatus. Naucoridae and Belostomatidae have a median lip‐valve, Notonectidae and Gelastocoridae a pair of stop‐valves, Corixidae a median flap‐valve. The valve opener muscles are usually dorso‐ventral but are ventral in Corixidae; the cuticular microsculpture in the metathoracic efferent system specifically in Hydrocorisae with stop‐valves (Notonectidae, Gelastocoridae) is similar to that widely present in Geocorisae. Groupings of Hydrocorisae from variations in the metathoracic occlusion apparatus differ from others based upon variations in the chemical constitution of the secretions. It is considered that the facts now known on metathoracic scent gland structure and function accord well with the hypothesis that Hydrocorisae constitute a polyphyletic assemblage. Copyrigh...|$|E
