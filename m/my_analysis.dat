2500|$|Maher's proof {{appears to}} {{contradict}} {{the result of the}} Bayesian argument, which was that the observation of a non-black non-raven provides much less evidence than the observation of a black raven. The reason is that the background knowledge that Good and others use can not be expressed {{in the form of a}} sample proposition – in particular, variants of the standard Bayesian approach often suppose (as Good did in the argument quoted above) that the total numbers of ravens, non-black objects and/or the total number of objects, are known quantities. Maher comments that, [...] "The reason we think there are more non-black things than ravens is because that has been true of the things we have observed to date. Evidence of this kind can be represented by a sample proposition. But ... given any sample proposition as background evidence, a non-black non-raven confirms A just as strongly as a black raven does ... Thus <b>my</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that this response to the paradox [...] cannot be correct." ...|$|E

60|$|This worthy was to {{have been}} brought to me, that I might discover, if possible, by what {{processes}} of 'that which he was pleased to call his mind' he had arrived at the conclusion that such a thing could be done. Clearly, he could not plead unavoidable ignorance of the subject-matter, as might the old cook at San Josef, who, the first time her master brought home Wenham Lake ice from Port of Spain, was scandalised at the dirtiness of the 'American water,' washed off the sawdust, and dried the ice in the sun. His was a case of Handy- Andyism, as that intellectual disease may be named, after Mr. Lover's hero; like that of the Obeah-woman, when she tried to bribe the white gentleman with half a dozen of bottled beer; a case of muddle-headed craft and elaborate silliness, which keeps no proportion between the means and the end; so common in insane persons; frequent, too, among the lower Irish, such as Handy Andy; and very frequent, I am afraid, among the Negroes. But--as might have been expected--the poor boy's moral sense had proved as shaky as his intellectual powers. He had just taken a fancy to some goods of his master's; and had retreated, to enjoy them the more securely, into the southern forests, with a couple of brown policemen on his track. So he was likely to undergo a more simple investigation than that which was submitted to <b>my</b> <b>analysis,</b> viz. how he proposed to wash the salt out of the sugar.|$|E

40|$|This paper centres {{around a}} {{creative}} design project for first-year fashion design students. This project was informed by (1) the theoretical underpinnings of design thinking, (2) a human-­centred approach {{to design and}} (3) protocol studies of novice engineering and industrial design students’ approaches to the design process. The design project assumed a design process method that focused on human beings – and their needs – as the driver for fashion design. The aim of adopting such a human‐centred method for creative design was three‐fold. Firstly, the design project aimed to create a culture and awareness of human beings and their needs as a driver for fashion design. Secondly, the project aimed to explore the design process of first-year fashion design students with regard to how they framed a design problem and design needs of human beings within a community, {{in an attempt to}} find the best possible solution. Thirdly, the design project aimed to establish whether the design process of novice fashion design students yielded similar or different results to that of empirical findings of protocol studies. In this paper, guided by the research question, which pertained to how novice fashion design students approached a human-centred design process, I offer a reflective analysis, as a fashion design educator, concerning the design process employed in this particular design project. I then compare <b>my</b> reflective <b>analysis</b> to findings from protocol studies conducted with novice engineering and industrial design students. The paper begins with a theoretical discussion of design thinking and human-­centred design. The discussion then shifts to the findings of protocol studies of novice engineering and industrial design students and their approach to the design process. Subsequently, the paper briefly contextualizes the creative design project and then focuses on <b>my</b> reflective <b>analysis</b> concerning the design methodology employed by novice fashion students drawing comparisons with the protocol studies. This research adopts a qualitative paradigm, and makes use of my detailed notes to support <b>my</b> reflective <b>analysis.</b> Based on a comparative method of analysis, I draw comparisons or differences between <b>my</b> reflective <b>analysis</b> and the findings of protocol studies. The paper contributes to the discourse on the design process, human-­centred design and design education from the perspective of fashion design and fashion design educatio...|$|R
