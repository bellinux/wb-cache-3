40|$|The use {{of direct}} <b>mould</b> <b>concrete</b> as {{material}} for the surfacing on bridges is an increasingly used coating option. But in order to implement this option at a larger scale, {{a change in the}} formula according to “bridge code 2004 part 62. 323 ” for direct <b>mould</b> <b>concrete</b> has to be made. This is because the present formula gives too high volumes of steel fiber. Thus this report will be a part of improving the said formula. In this report the author makes an inventory in which, among others things, the amount of bridges that have been directly molded with concrete as surfacing. The inventory shows in what intervals in both runway length and the area of the surface that is direct moulded as well as where and when these bridges were built. There is also an inventory made of what kind of damage these bridges have been suffering. This is then presented in graphical format {{in order to get a}} grip on its scope. Another part of the research made in this report is to study the temperature and relative humidity’s effects on concrete shrinkage. This is done to simulate the <b>concrete</b> <b>moulding</b> in different seasons and locations in the country. The goal is to acquire an understanding on the extent of direct <b>mould</b> <b>concrete</b> usage in Sweden, as well as to find a favorable moulding-environment. If the shrinkage process is slow the grip between the main concrete construction and the surface coating is better, which in turn results into a smaller amount of required steel fibers in the concrete. It also leads to easier processing when moulding, and minimizes the surface roughness of the bridge way. Validerat; 20120311 (anonymous...|$|R
50|$|Falsework {{consists}} of temporary structures used in construction to support spanning or arched structures {{in order to}} hold the component in place until its construction is sufficiently advanced to support itself. For arches, this is specifically called centering. Falsework also includes temporary support structures for formwork used to <b>mould</b> <b>concrete</b> to form a desired shape, scaffolding to give workers access to the structure being constructed, and shoring which is temporary structural reinforcement used during repairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used form of {{prefabrication}} in building and civil engineering {{is the use of}} prefabricated concrete and prefabricated steel sections in structures where a particular part or form is repeated many times. It can be difficult to construct the formwork required to <b>mould</b> <b>concrete</b> components on site, and delivering wet concrete to the site before it starts to set requires precise time management. Pouring concrete sections in a factory brings the advantages of being able to re-use <b>moulds</b> and the <b>concrete</b> can be mixed on the spot without having to be transported to and pumped wet on a congested construction site. Prefabricating steel sections reduces on-site cutting and welding costs as well as the associated hazards.|$|R
50|$|The narrow high {{triangular}} parapeted rear {{entrance is}} accessed from the courtyard from a door sheltered by a <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> awning supported by consoles which sits beneath the large semi-circular window which lights the main stairwell.|$|E
50|$|The central {{projecting}} parapets to each elevation contain {{panels of}} terracotta tiles with a stylised diamond pattern to each tile. The <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> door surrounds to the north, {{south and east}} entrances have vertical bands of an arrow pattern to the upper corners.|$|E
50|$|Staddles {{are often}} found in {{architectural}} salvage yards {{as they may be}} seen as attractive structures. They are also sold new, being made from <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete.</b> Chainsaws are used to produce wooden 'staddle stones' for use as garden seats or ornaments. In this context the staddle stones are often called mushroom stones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{results from}} an extensive {{study on the}} calculation of the surface free energy of mineral materials. The usefulness of such evaluation is demonstrated through the technological operation of casting and <b>moulding</b> <b>concrete.</b> Surface interactions will firstly act on the dispersion of particles inside the concrete mix and the viscosity of the fresh material; the specific effect of superplasticizers and Modifying Viscosity Agent is presented through the determination of surface free energy properties. The second analysis {{is dealing with the}} interactions between mineral and vegetal oils applied on the wooden or steel formwork and fresh concrete. The evaluation of contact angle and interfacial forces help to efficiently select the most appropriate material. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Coignet is the {{inventor}} of <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> which is known as Béton Coignet. He had much success at building {{with this type of}} concrete. He became a renowned building contractor and showed his many designs, including the molded concrete church of Le Vesinet near Paris. This church with its 130-foot spire is the first modern monumental building built in concrete.|$|E
50|$|The timber framed {{building}} clad with weatherboards has a gabled roof, sheeted with {{corrugated steel}} and supported on concrete piers topped with termite caps. Entrance {{to the building}} is achieved up three <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> steps through a single wooden door located on the southern side of the building. Two pairs of casement windows are located {{on each side of}} the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} seven spans of 45.7 ft each, {{with a total}} span of 319.6 ft. The bridge is 24.2 ft wide, and has an asphalt-over-concrete deck. The substructure {{is made up of}} concrete abutments and wingwalls with solid concrete piers. Other features of the bridge include <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> guardrails with arch-pierced concrete walls, cantilevered roadway with tapered cantilevered brackets, and tapered girder haunches at piers.|$|E
5000|$|Dolosse are {{normally}} made from un-reinforced concrete, poured into a steel <b>mould.</b> The <b>concrete</b> will sometimes be mixed with small steel fibers, to strengthen {{it in the}} absence of reinforcing. Construction is done {{as close as possible to}} the site of installation because the dolosse are very heavy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} an In situ Fabricator, a mobile robot intended for on-site manufacturing, assembly and digital fabrication. We present an overview of a prototype system, its capabilities, and highlight the importance of high-performance control, estimation and planning algorithms for achieving desired construction goals. Next, we detail on two architectural application scenarios: first, building a full-size undulating brick wall, which required a number of repositioning and autonomous localisation manoeuvres. Second, the Mesh <b>Mould</b> <b>concrete</b> process, which shows that an In situ Fabricator in combination with an innovative digital fabrication tool can be used to enable completely novel building technologies. Subsequently, important limitations and disadvantages of our approach are discussed. Based on that, we identify the need for a new type of robotic actuator, which facilitates the design of novel full-scale construction robots. We provide brief insight into the development of this actuator and conclude the paper with an outlook on the next-generation In situ Fabricator, which is currently under development...|$|R
50|$|The 1891 section has {{an ornate}} parapet {{broken by a}} central gable and small gable roof entry lobby. This gable has an open-bed {{pediment}} above the central front opening. The openings {{on either side of}} the entrance have rectangular windows surmounted by an arched <b>concrete</b> <b>moulding</b> descending to a dripstone and broken by a keystone. The pair of windows either side of the entrance and side windows are casement windows and are delineated by <b>concrete</b> <b>moulding</b> that is horizontal beneath the sill and outlines the arch of the window shape. All windows are recessed into the wall.|$|R
50|$|Entrance to {{the main}} (first) level is via a split stair with an iron {{balustrade}} to a large central door comprising two leaves with moulded panels, glazed fanlight, and rendered architrave and hood. A wide, short hall leads {{to the main}} perpendicular corridor. The hall has <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> skirtings, rendered walls, timber plate rail, and sheet-and-battens ceiling. A wall-mounted plaque commemorates the building's opening. A teacher's room is {{on either side of}} the hall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{extension}} is radically different from anything else on the London Underground. Stations are characterised by cavernous, stark interiors lined with polished metal panels and <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> walls and columns. Some of the stations are truly enormous; [...] {{has been compared to}} a cathedral, with it being said that the neighbouring One Canada Square, if laid on its side, could fit in the station with room to spare. [...] has a dramatic vertical void nearly 40 m deep.|$|E
5000|$|There is an L shaped {{concrete}} stable building {{behind the}} house which is marked with the date [...] "1926." [...] It has a hipped, metal clad roof and large timber doors. The walls are rough cast and have metal framed multiple-panel windows set within <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> surrounds. Situated {{to the west of}} the stables is a small building constructed of timber slabs on a pole frame with a gabled roof. This is believed to be the oldest building on the site.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of the SZD-40 Halny uses mixed materials, with a fibeglass {{laminated}} forward fuselage, {{welded steel}} tube centre-section truss, rolled aluminum tube rear fuselage boom and fibreglass laminate tail section.The wings, extended to 20m span by adding extensions {{to the roots}} using a section substantially modified from the Zefir 4's original NACA 66 216 416, were constructed from plywood, pressure <b>moulded</b> in <b>concrete</b> <b>moulds</b> {{and covered with a}} layer of glass-fibre, to give a very smooth and accurate finish. [...] Another meaningful modification from the original Zefir series wing was a change from Fowler (wing loading decreasing) flaps to camber increasing slotless flaps. This (flap) modification was a definite departure from previous (Zefir) attempts in variable wing geometry glider design. Notes by Eng. Jerzy Śmielkiewicz suggest that this was due to realisation that a laminar flow could not be sustained over the wing with (high speed retracted configuration) Fowler flap mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Wood is {{a natural}} organic {{material}} consisting primarily of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of lignin. Regarding mechanical properties, the fibers are strong in tension, and the lignin matrix resists compression. Thus wood {{has been an important}} construction material since humans began building shelters and using boats. Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as lumber or timber. In construction, wood is not only a structural material, but is also used to form the <b>mould</b> for <b>concrete.</b>|$|R
40|$|End {{restrained}} steel moulds {{having a}} channel section {{were used to}} study restrained shrinkage cracking. In these <b>moulds</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens from different mixes were cast to measure the free and restrained shrinkage strain. Three local admixtures of (FDMA) were used which are lime stone dust (LSD), Silica flour (SF) and bentonite (Bt). Three levels of addition were used for each type, (1. 5 %, 3 % and 4 % by weight of cement) for (LSD), (2. 5 %, 5 % and 8 % by weight of cement) for (SF) admixture and (2. 5 %, 4. 5 % and 6 % by weight of cement) for bentonite admixture. The experimental results illustrate that For concrete specimens with different levels of (LSD), the free shrinkage strain decreased at early and later ages, while no noticeable effect was observed in free shrinkage strain with (SF) at all ages but it increased significantly with (Bt) addition. The increase of content of any admixture used leads to a decrease in cracking time, crack width and creep strain at (cracking time). Mathematical models were developed in this study. Non-linear regression estimation is used to evaluate good coefficient correlation with less difference between the observed value and predicted value (df) and with fewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} verandahs are {{supported}} by paired cast iron columns with corinthian capitals; these are in turn supported by masonry plinths. Between these are cast iron balustrades with timber hand rails. These columns support a dentiled soffit. Similarly paired cast iron columns support the first floor balcony and the ground level balustrade has <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> balustrading with hourglass-shaped balusters. The corners of the ground floor verandah are visually strengthened by construction in masonry with recessed arcading. The ground floor verandah is paved in polychromatic geometric tiles.|$|E
50|$|Sheltered by a {{hipped roof}} clad with {{corrugated}} metal sheeting the building, at street {{level to the}} north corner, is supported on concrete stumps and stone retaining walls accommodating {{the slope of the}} site south and southwest down to Mary Street. Three rendered masonry chimney stacks rise from rooms on the eastern side. Decorative paired timber roof brackets interspersed with rectangular <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> indents run around the building under the main roof. A reconstructed timber floored verandah runs around the northeast and northwest sides, sheltered by a concave roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{elevation}} is symmetrical about a projecting broken pedimented entrance {{dominated by the}} lift tower which is emphasised by relieved rendered quoining. A small flight of concrete steps flanked by freestanding decorative wrought iron lamps arrives at the entrance porch which is sheltered by a <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> awning supported by large console brackets. Repetitive rhythmic detailing of flat arched timber sash windows to this elevation gives it a stark presence to the street. The elevation is disrupted by the later flights of open metal fire stairs {{to the east and}} west ends.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of specific weight lowering of kaolin suspensions using air-entraining agents. These agents are usually used as concrete admixtures. The goal of the thesis is to verify an alternative possibility of creating porous structure in kaolin suspensions in order to prepare heat insulating <b>moulded</b> refractory <b>concretes</b> without using lightweight fillers. The effect of several air-entraining agents was compared, after that the dosage of agent and mixing conditions were optimized. The stabilization of prepared foams and practical application of selected agents were also part of the thesis...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{concrete}} {{water storage}} tanks and generator/pump shed (no UQ number), located {{adjacent to the}} Dressing Shed above Lockyer Creek. These {{are associated with the}} early water supply to the campus established in the late 1920s. The tanks are circular, of <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> construction, and highly intact. They stand approximately 2.5 to 3 metres above ground. The generator/pump shed adjacent to the tanks is a small, timber-framed, skillion-roofed structure clad externally with corrugated metal sheeting. The generator/pump has been removed but the concrete plinth on which it rested remains.|$|E
5000|$|To be a {{high-speed}} trunk route, its 1930s planners designed some parts to be three-roads-in-one. The central section was exclusively for through traffic while adjacent side roads - {{either side of}} the main carriageway - provided local access. Although the sections within Liverpool were dual carriageway from the beginning, a few short stretches through Salford continue to use the original three-lane layout. The rest of the road was converted to dual with a central reservation in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the original 1930s bridges remain; they were built from steel in preparation for any future expansion as they would be easier to replace than ones constructed from <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} dam with an unlined side spillway {{extending from}} the left abutment, it is 56 m tall; 247 m long; and it holds [...] of water. Cataract Dam was the first dam built in the Upper Nepean Scheme. It was also first dam in Australia to use pre-cast <b>moulded</b> <b>concrete</b> blocks for the upstream face of the dam. The downstream face is of mass poured basalt concrete, with a basalt facing. A readily accessible source of suitable rock was located at Sherbrooke, situated {{near the top of}} Bulli Pass. To transport the basalt from the quarry to the dam construction site, a [...] gauge steam tramway, 8.8 km long, was constructed.|$|E
50|$|Concrete is a fluid {{that offers}} the {{opportunity}} to economically create structures of almost any geometry - we can pour <b>concrete</b> into a <b>mould</b> of almost any shape. This fluidity is seldom utilise, with concrete instead being poured into rigid moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. The ubiquitous use of orthogonal <b>moulds</b> as <b>concrete</b> formwork {{has resulted in a}} well-established vocabulary of prismatic forms for concrete structures, yet such rigid formwork systems must resist considerable pressures and consume significant amounts of material. Moreover, the resulting member requires more material and has a greater self-weight than one cast with a variable cross section.|$|R
50|$|The {{process has}} won the Design for Development award of the South African Bureau of Standards Design Institute in 1997, with the {{institute}} praising Moladi as:...an interlocking and modular shutter system for <b>moulding</b> complex <b>concrete</b> structures. The panels are lightweight and very robust. The system is especially suited for affordable low-cost, mass housing schemes. In {{addition to being a}} part of the drive by the South African government to replace shantytowns with proper houses, Moladi also exports to third world countries like Panama, where the company also plans to set up a factory. The company also opened a new factory in Port Elizabeth in 2008.|$|R
