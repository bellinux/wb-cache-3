40|$|Biomass burning {{releases}} trace {{gases and}} aerosol particles that significantly affect {{the composition and}} chemistry of the atmosphere. Australia contributes approximately 8 % of gross global carbon emissions from biomass burning, yet there are few previous measurements of emissions from Australian forest fires available in the literature. This paper describes the results of field measurements of trace gases emitted during hazard reduction burns in Australian temperate forests using open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In a companion paper, similar techniques are used to characterise the emissions from hazard reduction burns in the savanna regions of the Northern Territory. Details of the experimental methods are explained, including both the measurement set-up and the analysis techniques employed. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} different ways to estimate whole-fire emission factors are discussed and a measurement uncertainty budget is developed. Emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires are measured locally for the first time for many trace gases. Where ecosystem-relevant data are required, we recommend the following emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires (in grams of gas emitted per kilogram of dry fuel burned) which are our mean measured values: 1620 ± 160 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon dioxide; 120 ± 20 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon monoxide; 3. 6 ± 1. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methane; 1. 3 ± 0. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethylene; 1. 7 ± 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formaldehyde; 2. 4 ± 1. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methanol; 3. 8 ± 1. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetic acid; 0. 4 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formic acid; 1. 6 ± 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ammonia; 0. 15 ± 0. 09 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of nitrous oxide and 0. 5 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethane...|$|R

40|$|Savanna fires {{contribute}} approximately 40 – 50 % {{of total}} global annual biomass burning carbon emissions. Recent comparisons of emission factors from different savanna regions have highlighted {{the need for}} a regional approach to emission factor development, and better assessment of the drivers of the temporal and spatial variation in emission factors. This paper describes the results of open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopic field measurements at 21 fires occurring in the tropical savannas of the Northern~Territory, Australia, within different vegetation assemblages and at different stages of the dry season. Spectra of infrared light passing through a long (22 – 70 m) open-path through ground-level smoke released from these fires were collected using an infrared lamp and a field-portable FTIR system. The IR spectra were used to retrieve the mole fractions of 14 different gases present within the smoke, and these measurements used to calculate the emission ratios and emission factors of the various gases emitted by the burning. Only a handful of previous emission factor measures are available specifically for the tropical savannas of Australia and here we present the first reported emission factors for methanol, acetic acid, and formic acid for this biome. Given the relatively large sample size, it was possible to study the potential causes of the within-biome variation of the derived emission factors. We find that the emission factors vary substantially between different savanna vegetation assemblages; with a majority of this variation being mirrored by variations in the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) of different vegetation classes. We conclude that a significant majority of the variation in the emission factor for trace gases can be explained by MCE, irrespective of vegetation class, as illustrated by variations in the calculated methane emission factor for different vegetation classes using data sub-set by different combustion efficiencies. Therefore, the selection of emission factors for emissions modelling purposes need not necessarily require detailed fuel type information, if data on MCE (e. g. from future spaceborne total column measurements) or a correlated variable were available.

The feeding value of azolla in laying hens was studied in two feeding trials of 16 and 8 weeks duration, respectively. Azolla meal was included at a level of 50 or 100 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> diet at the expense of sesame meal in diets formulated on a total protein and total amino acid, or digestible protein and digestible amino acid basis (Trial 1). In Trial 2, 150 and 200 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> azolla meal was included in diets formulated using a total protein and total amino acid, or digestible protein and digestible amino acid basis. L-lysine HCl and DL-methionine were added to the diets formulated using digestible nutrients to adjust the digestible lysine and methionine contents to those in the wheat sesame meal based control diet. It was found that azolla meal could replace sesame meal on a digestible protein and digestible amino acid basis up to 200 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> diet with egg production as the parameter, while it could replace only up to 150 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> sesame meal in the diet based on total protein and total amino acids.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to {{study the effects of}} interactions between low quality grass silage (GS) dominated by orchardgrass and maize silage (MS) on ad libitum intake, digestibility and nitrogen retention in wether sheep. The study consisted of four feeding treatments involving GS and MS alone and GS and MS mixtures in a ratio of 67 : 33 or 33 : 67 (dry matter (DM) basis) fed twice daily. The GS was high in DM (463 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1), neutral detergent fibre (715 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) and acid detergent fibre (429 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) while low in crude protein (90. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM). The DM content (<b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1) and starch concentration (<b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) of MS were 264 and 211, respectively. The inclusion of MS into diet had positive linear effects on fresh matter ad libitum intake (kg d 1 and <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 M 0. 75 d 1) (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001 respectively), digestibility of DM (P < 0. 01), organic matter (P < 0. 01), acid detergent fibre (P < 0. 05), starch (P < 0. 001), digestibility of organic matter in DM (D-value) (P < 0. 001), nitrogen intake (P < 0. 01) and nitrogen output in faeces (P < 0. 01). A positive associative effect of low quality GS and MS was observed for ad libitum intake (kg d 1 and <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 M 0. 75 d 1) of fresh matter (quadratic, P < 0. 01), DM (quadratic, P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 01 respectively) and organic matter (P < 0. 001), for digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, crude protein, starch and D-value (quadratic, P < 0. 01), digestibility of organic matter (quadratic, P < 0. 05), nitrogen intake (quadratic, P < 0. 001) and nitrogen balance (quadratic, P < 0. 05).

Fuel-based emission factors (EF; with units of pollutant mass emitted per kg of fuel combusted) were determined for fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), inorganic ions, trace metals, and organic species. For the forced draught zig-zag brick kiln, EF PM 2. 5 ranged 1 – 19  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 with major contributions from OC (7  %), sulfate {{expected to be}} in the form of sulfuric acid (31. 9  %), and other chemicals not measured (e. g., particle bound water). For the clamp kiln, EF PM 2. 5 ranged 8 – 13  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1, with major contributions from OC (63. 2  %), sulfate (20. 8  %), and ammonium (14. 2  %). Our brick kiln EF PM 2. 5 values may exceed those previously reported, partly because we sampled emissions at ambient temperature after emission from the stack or kiln allowing some particle-phase OC and sulfate to form from gaseous precursors. The combustion of mixed household garbage under dry conditions had an EF PM 2. 5 of 7. 4  ±  1. 2  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1, whereas damp conditions generated the highest EF PM 2. 5 of all combustion sources in this study, reaching up to 125  ±  23  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1. Garbage burning emissions contained relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), triphenylbenzene, and heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Sb), making these useful markers of this source. A variety of cooking stoves and fires fueled with dung, hardwood, twigs, and/or other biofuels were studied. The use of dung for cooking and heating produced higher EF PM 2. 5 than other biofuel sources and consistently emitted more PM 2. 5 and OC than burning hardwood and/or twigs; this trend was consistent across traditional mud stoves, chimney stoves, and 3 -stone cooking fires. The comparisons of different cooking stoves and cooking fires revealed the highest PM emissions from 3 -stone cooking fires (7. 6 – 73  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), followed by traditional mud stoves (5. 3 – 19. 7  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), mud stoves with a chimney for exhaust (3. 0 – 6. 8  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), rocket stoves (1. 5 – 7. 2  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), induced-draught stoves (1. 2 – 5. 7  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), and the bhuse chulo stove (3. 2  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1), while biogas had no detectable PM emissions. Idling motorcycle emissions were evaluated before and after routine servicing at a local shop, which decreased EF PM 2. 5 from 8. 8  ±  1. 3  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 to 0. 71  ±  0. 4  <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 when averaged across five motorcycles. Organic species analysis indicated that this reduction in PM 2. 5 was largely due to a decrease in emission of motor oil, probably from the crankcase.

The proportion of fixed N increased from 50 % without bio-char additions to 72 % with 90 <b>g</b> <b>kg?</b> 1 bio-char added. While total N derived from the atmosphere (NdfA) significantly increased by 49 and 78 % with 30 and 60 <b>g</b> <b>kg?</b> 1 bio-char added to soil, respectively, NdfA decreased to 30 % above the control with 90 <b>g</b> <b>kg?</b> 1 due to low total biomass production and N uptake. The primary reason for the higher BNF with bio-char additions was the greater B and Mo availability, whereas greater K, Ca, and P availability, as well as higher pH and lower N availability and Al saturation, {{may have contributed to}} a lesser extent. Enhanced mycorrhizal infections of roots were not found to contribute to better nutrient uptake and BNF. Bean yield increased by 46 % and biomass production by 39 % over the control at 90 and 60 <b>g</b> <b>kg?</b> 1 bio-char, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was a representation of chemical composition of pasture samples from different farms and NDF degradability examination by in sacco method. The experiment took place on three farms with different altitudes. All samples were analyzed for ash, crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF). NDF degradability was evaluated by in sacco method in chosen herbs from samples of pasture. During the grazing season in a sward reduces the content of NL {{and at the same}} time increases the content of CF. During the pasture period declines the share of clovers in growth and on the contrary significantly higher proportion of grasses. The highest NDF degradability all the time of incubation in the rumen was in Taraxacum officinale and varied from 453. 1 <b>g.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 NDF in 6 h of incubation to 882. 1 <b>g.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 NDF in 72 h of incubation. The lowest NDF degradability was in Rumex obtusifolius (198. 1 to 581. 8 <b>g.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 NDF) and Ranunculus acris (278. 6 to 566 <b>g.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 NDF). Differences between farms are minimal...|$|R
