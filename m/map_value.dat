Alternatively, culling front faces and only rendering the back of objects to the shadow map is sometimes used for a similar result.|$|E

A system is robust when it achieves both a high Mean Average Precision (<b>MAP)</b> <b>value</b> for the entire set of topics and a significant <b>MAP</b> <b>value</b> over its worst X topics (MAP(X)). It is a well known fact that Query Expansion (QE) increases global MAP but hurts the performance on the worst topics. A selective application of QE would thus be a natural answer to obtain a more robust retrieval system...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the accuracy of thematic maps or classified remotely sensed images has been much discussed, but no single approach has emerged as uniformly useful. Various success measures, such as kappa or the overall accuracy, can be derived for a map or classified image but, when addressing {{different aspects of the}} map such as the number and taxonomic detail of map classes, these measures may not be completely appropriate. In addition, strong arguments have been made that the use of kappa should be replaced with the use of allocation and quantity disagreement. Also, different measures of map accuracy may be combined into a single measure of 'composite map value', the form of which may be context specific. To illustrate this, we consider a composite <b>map</b> <b>value</b> metric (V*) that considers the overall predictive accuracy as well as the number, detail and accuracy of map classes. For recently suggested measures of <b>map</b> <b>value,</b> confidence intervals have not been considered. Our aim is to discuss generic methods to derive confidence intervals for assessment metrics with an emphasis on a simply implemented bootstrap procedure adapted for use with sparse confusion matrices with numerous zero entries...|$|E

30|$|The Taxiways {{is defined}} as a {{composite}} type which consists of four components, i.e., taxiways, optimals, suboptimals and edges.

A <b>map</b> <b>value</b> can be assumed as an unordered collection of pairs in which the first element is a key which is used to get the second element of the pair.

We propose a new action recognition system by exploiting very deep two-stream ConvNets and Fisher vector representation of iDT features. Specifically, we utilize those successful very deep architectures in images such as GoogLeNet and VGGNet to design the two-stream ConvNets. From our experiments, we see that deeper architectures obtain higher performance for spatial nets. However, for temporal net, deeper archi-tectures could not yield better recognition accuracy. We an-alyze that the UCF 101 dataset is relatively very small {{and it is very}} hard to train such deep networks on the current ac-tion datasets. Compared with traditional iDT features, our implemented two-stream ConvNets significantly outperfor-m them.

40|$|Decoding in {{wireless}} rapidly fading channels {{requires that}} the receiver has access to explicit or implicit channel-state information (CSI). This paper presents a joint channel estimation and decoding scheme for frequency-flat, time-selective Rayleigh fading with relatively high Doppler, that does not require external phase information or even pilot symbols. This system outperforms a pilot-aided iterative channel estimation algorithm that does not decode and estimate jointly. The joint decoding algorithm models the phase trajectory of the channel as a suitable Markov process, the dynamics of which depend on the Doppler rate. At each iteration it considers all possible phase trajectories to determine the maximum a posteriori probability (<b>MAP)</b> <b>value</b> for each bit. This decoding procedure is {{a natural extension of}} standard turbo decoding, but introduces a significant complexity increase. Performance is assessed via an upper bound to the capacity of a Markov-phase channel. 1 Introduction Si [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we are {{interested}} in the problem of finding maximum a posteriori probability (<b>MAP)</b> <b>value</b> assignments for a set of discrete attributes, given the constraint that some of the attributes are permanently fixed to some values a priori. For building a system capable of this type of uncertain reasoning in practice, we need first to construct an accurate abstract representation of the problem domain, and then to establish an efficient search mechanism for finding MAP configurations within the constructed model. We propose a hybrid Bayesian network-neural network system for solving these two subtasks. The Bayesian network component can be used for constructing a compact, high-level representation for the problem domain probability distribution quickly and reliably, assuming that suitable expert knowledge is available. The neural network component provides then a computationally efficient, massively parallel platform for searching the model state space. The main application areas f [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design and}} performance evaluation of a pilot-aided turbo-coded system to achieve reliable PSK communication in frequencyflat, time-selective fading, with a relatively high Doppler rate. We introduce a suitable Markov model with {{a finite number of}} states, designed to approximate both the values and the statistical properties of the correlated flat fading channel phase, which poses a more severe challenge to PSK transmission than amplitude fading. The Forward-Backward algorithm is used to determine both the maximum a posteriori probability (<b>MAP)</b> <b>value</b> for each bit in the data sequence, and the MAP channel phase in each iteration. Soft information is exchanged between the phase and data estimation modules. Using a turbo-code and joint iterative decoding and channel estimation, performance is demonstrated to approach an upper bound to the capacity of a Markov-phase channel. I.

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the importance of visual representations of strategic intent in order to understand how organizational resources – especially intangible assets and intellectual capital – are used to create value. Based on the literature the paper provides a taxonomy of organizational value drivers.
