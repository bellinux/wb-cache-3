50|$|Polyamide {{material}} is heated until liquid (typically at 410F/210C). The hot liquid Polyamide {{material is}} then injected {{at very low}} pressure, typically 50 to 200 psi (3.5 to 14 bar) into a relative cold mold-set (65F/18C). The low viscosity polyamide material flows gently into the mold-set cavity and around the electronics to be encapsulated. It also starts cooling down {{as soon as it}} touches the mold-set cavity and the electronics. A mold-set cavity is typically filled in a few seconds but a typical full <b>molding</b> <b>cycle</b> is 20 to 45 seconds. As the Polyamide material starts to cool down it also starts to shrink. Continuous injection pressure is therefore applied to the cavity, even after its initial fill. This is done in order to compensate for the shrinkage that naturally occurs when the Polyamide material goes from liquid to solid (i.e. hot to cold). The Polyamide temperature is not too hot for the electronics and does not re-melt or re-flow the solder. This is simply because the relative cold mold-set will absorb the brunt of the heat, thereby reducing the temperature that a circuit board may see. Millions of circuit boards are successfully over-molded without causing any harm in the process. A low injection pressure does not stress a fragile solder joint.|$|E

Ultimately, the solidified part is ejected from the mold without damage.

40|$|Abstract: Reduction {{in plastic}} {{injection}} <b>molding</b> <b>cycle</b> time and increase in part quality are two {{goals that are}} not usually thought of as being compatible. Conformal cooling channels {{are one of the}} technologies that will help achieve both goals. Cooling time is the only phase of the injection <b>molding</b> <b>cycle</b> that has significant time to reduce. Reduction in cooling time usually results in parts with hotter temperatures. This could result in increased part shrinkage and warpage. The key to cycle time reduction and better quality is to cool the parts uniformly and more quickly. This study will show that conformal cooling channels provide better cooling than standard conventional cooling lines. By designing cooling channels around the part’s geometry, more uniform cooling can be achieved compared to standard conventional cooling lines. Rapid tooling is the easiest and most inexpensive method to construct conformal cooling lines in mold inserts. It is important to balance mold strength with cooling concerns. Cooling lines in the inserts reduce the structural integrity of the inserts. Correct placement and design of the cooling channels is needed to reduce the effect of the cooling lines on the structural integrity of the inserts. Computer-Aided-Engineering tools are needed to optimize the mold inserts for cooling and strength. High Density Polyethylene and Polycarbonate were used in this study. The mold and melt temperature differences between the two materials will help to illustrate the difference between the mold materials and cooling line layouts...|$|E
