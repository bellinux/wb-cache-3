Trichoderma spp. was isolated with the highest occurrence from the examined P. ostreatus (33.30 %) and their associated soil (17.10 %). The cellulolytic filamentous fungi are responsible for green mold disease on mushrooms and spoilage of <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawns</b> [27]; the mold causes substantial and economic losses of some edible mushrooms, namely, species of Pleurotus, Agaricus and Lentinula in South Korea, Italy, Hungary, Canada, USA, Iran, New Zealand and Romania [28, 29]. Streptomyces spp., Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces bovis, Pseudomonas putida, Penicillium italicum, Fusarium spp. and others were isolated from the soil around wild P. ostreatus. Streptomyces spp. produce indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), which acts as biocontrol against soil-borne pathogenic microorganisms. Many microorganisms exert growth-promoting effects by secreting beneficial secondary metabolites and enzymes that support spore germination and fruiting formation of wild mushrooms [30, 31].

The mushroom's scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions. In the time of China's Qing Dynasty, the species was collected in Yunnan Province and sent to the Imperial Palaces to satisfy the appetite of Empress Dowager Cixi, who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi.

Another notable use was a state banquet held for American diplomat Henry Kissinger on his visit to China to reestablish diplomatic relations in the early 1970s. One source writes of the mushroom: [...] "It has a fine and tender texture, fragrance and is attractive, beautiful in shape, fresh and crispy in taste." [...] The dried fungus, commonly sold in Asian markets, is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender.

Oil palm fronds were cut and used to grow Pleurotus ostreatus. The first fructification occurred 20 days after waterring. The biological efficiency reached at 28. 6 %. When sawdust of para rubber logs was added to the cut oil palm fronds at the rate of 1 : 1 (vol : vol.), the biological efficiency reached at 39. 3 %. Supplementary material at the rate of 5 % was also added into the combination of cut oil palm frond and sawdust. The result showed that rice bran, corn meal or oil palm-kernel meal give yields between 142. 2 - 165. 0 g/bag (B. E. = 42. 8 - 49. 6), which were not statistically different. Oil palm pericarp waste was also used as main substrate for P. ostreatus cultivation. The average yield obtained during 40 days havesting period was 112. 6 g/bag (B. E. = 64. 3 %). Addition of sawdust or rice bran into pericarp waste decreased the yield of the basidiocarps. Palm-kernel meal at the rate of 5 - 20 % was used as a supplement material. Addition of 20 % palmkernel meal into sawdust supported higher yield. The biological efficiency reached 55. 8 %. From the above results, four formulae of the substrate were prepared. Treatment of oil palm pericarp waste + 3 % rice bran + 3 % corn meal + 0. 75 % Ca(OH 2) supported higher yield of the basidiocarps. The average yield obtained from 950 g of substrate was 190. 2 g during 60 days havesting (B. E. = 57. 2 %). Using 6 % palm-kernel substitute 3 % rice bran + 3 % corn meal supported the same yield (B.

40|$|Mushrooms, or edible fungi, are {{appreciated}} {{for their}} good taste and nutritional value by many cultures, {{but to a}} rather limited extent in most ACP countries. In many places they are collected from the wild, {{but it is possible}} to culture mushrooms, although to do so successfully their biology and growing requirements must be understood. It is to assist the wider understanding of the potential of mushrooms as a farm crop in ACP countries and their exploitation that CTA has co-published with the Transfer Technology for Development (TOOL) the practical Manual on mushroom cultivation. Techniques of cultivation, species and opportunities for commercial exploitation in developing countries are described with case-histories, diagrams and illustrations. Some of the information has previously only been accessible to readers of Chinese and is available {{now for the first time}} in English. Mushroom growing involves many steps, from selecting a suitable technique and strain to spawn manufacturing, growing the crop and marketing the final product. This manual on the cultivation of mushrooms in tropical situations covers general biological information about the nature of mushrooms, information on how to conduct a feasibility study, the commercial potential of mushrooms, and technical information on the cultivation of more than ten species of fungi. In earlier times cultivation of mushrooms often failed because their biology was not understood. The first records indicate that the wood ear mushroom (Auricularia) was cultivated from 600 AD onwards. The cultivation of white mushrooms (Agaricus) started about 1650 in France. Cultivation spread rapidly after the second World War when reliable <b>spawn</b> (<b>mushroom</b> seed) became commonly available in a number of countries. However, most mushrooms are still currently produced in the western hemisphere and South-East Asia, especially mainland China and Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Mushroom growing has many advantages. No arable land is needed and agriculturaI wastes, such as straw, are converted into fertilizers and soil conditioners. Income is generated, because mushrooms have a high added value in comparison to other crops. An extra source of protein and valuable vitamins and minerals is added to local diets. In most cases a fast return on any investment is possible. The Chinese have developed many methods of growing mushrooms with limited inputs and it is some of these methods described in this book that are published for the first time in English. These techniques can easily be applied in ACP countries also and a start has been made. Examples are Malawi, where the government has sent technicians to Taiwan to study Agaricus production; and Burundi, where the Chinese have recently started a commercial spawn enterprise. The potential for using waste products as a growing medium or substrate may be particularly appealing to many ACP countries. Shiitake mushrooms can be grown on wood logs in mountains with broadleaf tree forests, on pasteurized corn cobs and on sawdust. A technique for growing mushrooms on coffee pulp waste developed in Mexico can be adapted for coffee growing regions in Africa, Jamaica or Papua New Guinea. Culture can be in beds or where the substrate is held in plastic bags. Spawn production is still one of the limitations for mushroom cultivation in Africa, Latin America and some parts of Asia. Suitable strains are hard to obtain and there are still too few strains available that are suited to high temperature climates. However, some commercial strains from the Far East for low-input cultivation car now be ordered. Technical skills and c theoretical background are necessary to produce the spawn and accurate guideline: on producing various types of spawn are described in Manual on mushroom cultivation. In general, literature on mushroom culture is expensive and is not aimed at developing countries. By making the information in this book available to extension workers in ACI countries, CTA is encouraging the further dissemination of knowledge on a crop with considerable potential to farmers in their own country through local media and in the own language. The publication is available from CTA, free of charge, for ACP nationals. Manual on mushroom cultivation CTA has co-published with the Transfer Technology for Development (TOOL...|$|R

This basic concept {{was applied to the}} wheat grain used in the production of oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> in a bid to facilitate an increased adoption of oyster mushroom production in Zimbabwe and possibly in other developing countries. The use of Tyndallisation as an alternative to autoclaving grain for oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> production was investigated in a two-phased experiment. The first phase was for determining the period required to boil the water prior to boiling the wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain. This was investigated by boiling water for 5, 20 or 30 minutes prior to the normal Tyndallisation boiling (10 mins) for three days with overnight incubation. The second phase investigated the use of short boiling times for a longer duration. The wheat grain was boiled for 5 and 10 mins for 6 days with a 2 min prior boiling of the water. The spawn produced was tested for fruiting ability in banana substrate. Good quality spawn was obtained for the 30 mins boiling for the 2 and 3 days (first phase experiment) and the 5 mins boiling for 4 days (second phase experiment). Treatments varied significantly (ANOVA) in the number of days until presence of contamination. The duration of incubation for production of good quality spawn was determined to be one week.

The optimal environmental conditions for the Pleurotus strains were determined by establishing variability in growth response and primordium development on agar media over a range of growth parameters: osmotic potential (ï€­ 0. 5 MPa to ï€­ 5. 0 MPa), temperature (5 to 40 Â°C) and pH (2 to 12). The maximum growth rates and the optimum conditions for growth varied for the different strains. A Pleurotus ostreatus strain able to grow and fruit at elevated temperatures (25 Â°C) was identified that has potential for cultivation in the tropics. Nine strains were identified with high growth rates. Primordia were produced at low pH (4 to 6), at suboptimal growth temperatures (ï‚£ 25 Â°C), and under moderate water stress (ï€­ 0. 5 to ï€­ 3. 5 MPa). An investigation into the effect of micro-solute concentration changes on the growth response of the Pleurotus species was carried out on agar media using micro-concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The solutes at micro-concentrations ranging from 0. 35 g l- 1 to 1. 00 g l- 1 for PEG 6000, 1. 50 g l- 1 to 3. 85 g l- 1 for KCl and 0. 60 g l- 1 to 1. 54 g l- 1 for NaCl produced a two to three fold increase in {{the growth rate of}} the Pleurotus strains, which has potential application in oyster <b>mushrooms</b> (Pleurotus species) <b>spawn</b> production and cultivation. The optimum micro concentrations of combined KCl and NaCl solutes of 2. 70 g l- 1 KCl: 1. 08 g l- 1 NaCl or 3. 85 g l- 1 KCl: 1. 54 g l- 1 NaCl at 20 Â°C; and 1. 50 g l- 1 KCl: 0. 60 g l- 1 NaCl or 2. 70 g l- 1 KCl: 1. 08 g l- 1 NaCl for both 25 Â°C and 30 Â°C; of PEG 6000 of 0. 90 g l- 1 (20 Â°C) and 0. 65 g l- 1 (25 and 30 Â°C) were identified. Development of alternative spawn substrate protocols was done by varying the boiling, soaking periods for the substrates (maize [Zea mays] grain, maize cobs, pumpkin seeds [Cucurbita sp. ] and bean seeds [Phaseolus vulgaris]). Maize grain, pumpkin seeds and maize cobs with a water content of 35 to 39 %, 41 to 47 % and 64 % respectively have potential use as alternative substrates to wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain in Pleurotus species spawn production. The feasibility of creating novel media formulations for culturing Pleurotus strains was investigated by developing various whole wheat grain and crushed wheat grain mixtures. The novel media formulations of 1 : 3 (w/v) to 1 : 5 (whole wheat grain: distilled water) and 1 : 3 to 1 : 15 (crushed wheat grain: distilled water) were determined to be optimal for use as low-cost alternative media for culturing Pleurotus species for spawn production and cultivation purposes. An investigation in the use of Tyndallisation as a means of sterilising the growth media for spawn production was carried out by modifying primarily the boiling times and number of days of incubation. Tyndallisation of 30 minutes boiling daily for three days (wide-mouthed bottles) and 5 minutes boiling for four days (narrow-mouthed bottles) were optimal for production of Pleurotus species spawn. Alternative single substrates and substrate mixtures (1 : 1) were determined by growth and basidiome production on thatch grass (Agropyron sp.), banana fronds (Musa sapientum), wheat straw, sage (Coleochloa setifera); banana + sage, banana + grass, banana + wheat straw and sage + grass. Grass and sage were the best substrates singly and in combination with banana. Biological efficiencies greater than 140 % were obtained. Positive and negative synergistic effects on primordium development dependant on the strain and substrate mixture were noted. Genetic variability of Pleurotus species and strains was investigated by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. The 15 Pleurotus strains separated into four clusters. The internal transcribed spacer sequences analysis suggested that strain 31674 was misidentified as P. sajor-caju instead of P. ostreatus. The value of noting the history of the strain in phylogenetic analysis was proposed. This study recommends BCCM/MUCL strain 31017 (P. sajor-caju) for spawn production and cultivation processes due to having the characteristics of high growth rate, high biological efficiency, prolific primordial formation and moderate xerotolerance which are highly desirable for spawn production and cultivation processes...|$|R

The results revealed that P. sajor caju had the highest mycelia growth (7. 8 cm) on rice bran/soil culture media while P. tuber-regium had the highest mycelia growth (5. 8 cm) on cassava peels/soil culture media. V. voivacea had the highest mycelia growth (7. 1 cm) on palm fibre culture medium. The least mycelia growth (1. 5 - 4. 4 cm) was observed on potato dextrose agar culture media and yeast agar culture media. Therefore natural supernatant extracts culture media stimulated higher mycelia growth than synthetic agar culture media employed in this study. Thus it is recommended that P. sajor caju, P. tuber-ragium and Vvoivacea mycelium can be grown culturally on rice bran/soil, cassava peels/soil and palm fibre culture media respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Eight fungal and one {{bacterial}} contaminants from naturally contaminated spawn of {{oyster mushroom}} were isolated and identified. These were Aspergillus ffavus var. cotumneris, A. niger, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium janthinellum, Penicillium spp., Rhizopus stotoniter, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride and Bacillus brevis. Month-wise variation in spawn contaminations caused by various {{fungal and bacterial}} contaminants was observed. The contamination was the highest during the monsoon season (28. 57 %) followed by pre-monsoon (21. 90 %). Type of substrates {{was found to have}} influence on spawn contamination. Paddy grain based spawn recorded significantly lowest (15. 00 %) contamination as compared to wheat grain based (30. 00 %) spawn. Key words: Spawn, oyster mushroom Contamination of cereal grain based spawn caused by various mycoparasites has been constantly reported from many countries (Bitner, 1971; Biserka, 1972 and Suman and Jandaik, 1992). As a result, spawn manufacturers usually lose 15 - 20 % spawn due to spoilage caused by different contaminants (Suman and Jandaik, 1992; Ahlawat et al., 1999). Hence the spoilage of spawn due to some fungal and bacterial contaminants is considered {{to be one of the}} biggest constraints faced by the spawn producing laboratories. Considering the importance of this aspect the present study was undertaken to determine the type and extent of contamination of <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> bags and also to find out the effect of different factors affecting their incidence...|$|E
30|$|Although {{some heavy}} metals like Mn 2 +, Cr 2 +, Fe 3 + and Cd 2 + are {{required}} for growth of plants in trace amounts, they may damage plants if present beyond their maximum permissible limits [27]. Recent {{studies have shown that}} heavy metal uptake by the oyster mushroom into the cell across the cell membrane as intracellular uptake is dependent on the cell metabolism [3, 28]. This type of heavy metal uptake from mine dump waste by the oyster mushroom requires energy expenditure by the mushroom cells. Since the mushroom is heterotrophic, it uses the organic substrate as the source of energy. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical decomposition processes. Consequently, combinations of the viable <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> in dried mushroom and the wheat straw as source of energy for the active uptake of the heavy metals from mine dump waste in treatment 5 experimental pits were followed by considerable reductions of the heavy metal concentrations to be within safe limits (Fig.  2). The application of P. ostreatus as a biosorbent is not only dependent on its biosorptive capacity, but also {{how easy it is to}} regenerate and reuse oyster mushroom biomass. However, the intracellular heavy metal absorption by the mushroom cells can only mean that the absorbed heavy metals are disposed off through destructive treatment.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} find out the fungal competitors and symptom studies in damaged Oyster <b>Mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> packets at National Mushroom Development and Extension Center, Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of nine fungal competitors of oyster mushroom were isolated and identified namely- Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, T. viride Pers. (Green strain), T. viride Pers. (Yellow strain), T. koningii Oudem, Mucor hiemalis Wehmer, Papulaspora byssina Hotson, Neurospora sp. Shear and B. O. Dodge., Aspergillus flavus Link., and Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat. on the basis of microscopic, morphological and cultural characteristics. To produce oyster mushroom in an eco-friendly manner and {{to find out the}}ir antifungal potency, 23 plant species belonging to 19 families were screened out against isolated nine fungal competitors of oyster mushroom. Among 23 extracts, the maximum (44 %) mycelial inhibition of T. harzianum was found due to Aegle marmelos whereas Eclipta alba showed the highest mycelial inhibition (62 %) of T. viride (Green strain); in case of T. viride (Yellow strain), Cassia tora exhibited the highest mycelial inhibition (39 %); Diospyros cordifolia showed the maximum mycelial inhibition (48 %) of T. koningii; Curcuma longa (rhizome) gave the maximum mycelial inhibition (90 %) of Neurospora sp. There were no significant effects found to control of P. byssina, B. theobromae, M. hiemalis and A. flavus due to 23 different types of botanicals tested. Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride (Green strain), T. viride (Yellow strain), T. koningii, A. flavus, Neurospora sp. and P. byssina was successfully inhibited by 30, 50 and 70 ppm of fungicide-Bavistin 50 WP but B. theobromae and M. hiemalis were not affected by Bavistin at mentioned concentration...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{ascertain}} the viability of spawn produced on cassava peels and used for spawning cassava peels and sawdust substrates and compare the yield with mushroom fruits from the conventional Sorghum bicolor known {{to be the best}} material for spawn production. Three different species of mushroom cultures were inoculated on cassava peels, two Pleurotus pulmonarius strains (FIIRO and Thailand) and Lentinus squarroslus. The study of mycelia colonization rate study was done in triplicate. L. squarroslus completed colonization within 18 days of inoculation in test tube with a growth mean value of 11. 16 cm, the two strains of P. pulmonarius (FIIRO and Thailand) completed colonization in 21 days with FIIRO strain having growth mean value of 11. 46 cm and Thailand strain 11. 20 cm. Cassava peels spawn production was done in two ways, singly and supplemented with rice bran, yield from different species of mushroom (L. squarroslus and P. pulmonarius (FIIRO Strain) cultivated with cassava peels spawn in the study were compared with sorghum grains spawn. Different weight of 100, 200, 300 g were used for cultivation, sorghum grains spawn produced the highest yield (202. 13 g) from the two species used followed by cassava peels supplemented with rice bran (179. 86 g) and single cassava peels spawn (124. 13 g). L. squarroslus did not fruit on cassava peels even with the sorghum grains spawn. The differences from the yield of the three spawn was negligible as the differences was not noticeable (cassava peels 124. 133 ± 5. 21 a, supplemented cassava peels spawn 179. 867 ± 0. 64 a, and sorghum grains spawn 202. 133 ± 8. 86 a). This result verified the use of cassava peels in the production of viable <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn...</b>|$|E
40|$|Agaricus flocculosipes and A. subrufescens are edible {{species that}} belong to section Arvenses of the genus Agaricus. Agaricus subrufescens (almond mushroom) is known to produce {{bioactive}} compounds with medicinal properties, such as anti-cancer and anti-tumor activity and fruiting bodies are also edible and nutritious. Agaricus subrufescens is presently cultivated in Brazil, China, Japan, Taiwan and some European countries for use as foods and nutraceuticals. Agaricus flocculosipes is a newly described species currently known only from Thailand, Mayotte Island and China. Species of Agaricus have high potential for cultivation as many species are edible and have medicinal properties. Herein we report the first cultivation of A. flocculosipes and a Thai strain of A. subrufescens. The strains were isolated from wild sporocarps and subcultured on compost extract agar medium. Standard compost based on wheat straw and horse manure {{was used as the}} cultivation substrate. A comparative study of the cultivation of one strain of A. flocculosipes and two strains of A. subrufescens from France and Thailand was carried out with four replicates trays. The <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn</b> was inoculated into the compost and incubated at 25 °C. The mycelia fully covered and grew throughout the media after incubation for two weeks. A casing layer made up of sand, peat and lime (1 : 1 : 1) was applied. Fruiting phase was performed at 25 °C and 95 % humidity. The first primordia of the French and Thai strains of A. subrufescens occurred after the casing layer was added at days 12 and 24, respectively. Yields were obtained from both strains of A. subrufescens. The yield of the Thai strain (85. 90 ± 27. 06 g kg- 1) was lower than that of the French strain (178. 56 ± 68. 28 g kg- 1) in the first production cycle lasting 34 days. The first primordia of A. flocculosipes formed at day 32 after casing, and the strain produced only a few fruit bodies (1. 04 ± 0. 95 g kg- 1). Further research is needed to develop suitable agriculture wastes and regimes for growing these mushrooms and for increasing production yields so that these strains and species can be industrialized...|$|E
40|$|Two {{bacterial}} isolates N 10 and B 2, {{isolated from}} the dry paper mulberry bark and from the air of indoor?farmed straw mushroom, respectively, were identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus subtilis by the conventional and Biolog method. The antagonism of these bacteria against plant pathogens and various kinds of edible mushrooms were investigated in vitro to determine its potential for compost application. P. polymyxa N 10 inhibited plant pathogenic fungi, i. e., Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus niger, Alternaria sp., Sclerotium rolfsii and some edible mushrooms, i. e., Volvariella volvacea, Pleurotus ostreatus, P. abalonus, Lentinus squarrosulus and Auricularia auricular. P. polymyxa N 10 was also inhibitive to commonly contaminated fungi found in compost, such as Trichoderma sp. And onilia sp [...] B. subtilis B 2, on the other hand, did not inhibit the growth of V. volvacea but was antagonistic to almost all of tested fungi, except Trichoderma harzianum and Monilia sp [...] Our preliminary test showed that yield of straw mushroom was increased by supplementation of cultured broth in compost in outdoor cultivation. They were grown in shaken nutrient broth {{at room temperature for}} 24 hrs (ca. 1. 5 × 107 and 1. 0 × 107 cfu/ml for P. polymyxa N 10 and B. subtilis B 2) and sprayed to mushroom compost at the rate of one liter per 4 m 2 area of 45 kg dry wt., then inoculated with straw <b>mushroom</b> <b>spawn.</b> Seven crops were done per year and each crop was accomplished by two indoor farms consisting of three replications each. Results of experiments of the first two years clearly indicated that mushroom yields from the bacterial supplemented compost were significantly higher than those of the control and nutrient broth treated one. On the third year, soybean milk or cow milk were used as growing medium for bacteria instead of nutrient broth to simplify the bacterial preparation technique and B. subtilis B 2 was chosen as the only bacterial strain used for experiment based on experimental results of the previous two years. Overall results of the 3 year experiments strongly indicated that supplementation of P. polymyxa N 10 and B. subtilis B 2 to straw mushroom compost increased the mushroom yield over the non supplemented one...|$|E
