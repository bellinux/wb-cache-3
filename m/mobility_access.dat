25|$|There {{were several}} {{negative}} reactions, concerns and criticisms {{as a result}} of the December 2008 public meetings and online hearing where the preliminary findings of the MAPS (<b>Mobility,</b> <b>Access</b> and Pricing Study) were discussed. One participant questioned the rationale for having to pay to drive on a public street. Others considered that congestion pricing is a regressive tax imposing a greater burden on those without a good option to ride public transit and on low-income commuters. Other considered too expensive to pay USD 6.00 for a short duration trips. Zone residents with children and inflexible schedules complained they would be unfairly affected. Another major concern is the lack of reliability and capacity of San Francisco's existing network of transit services, limiting commuters to switch to public transport once the congestion pricing is implemented.|$|E

Community networks are inspired by a dynamic vision of community that incorporates a global sense of place. A global sense of place is valuable because it helps to illuminate a place 2 ̆ 7 s connections with the world and may therefore enable scale-jumping forms of activism. This article analyzes interviews with participants in four U.

The degree to which each network emphasizes <b>mobility,</b> <b>access,</b> and place varies. This variation has implications for both community activism and issues of diversity in community. Networks that fail to link <b>mobility,</b> <b>access,</b> and place may increase, rather than decrease, inequalities in access to electronic communications {{as well as to}} forms of political power...|$|E
