40|$|Abstract: A {{procedure}} for monitoring discrete multivariate counts is proposed. The procedure {{is based on}} two schemes: the first scheme detects a shift {{in one or two}} of the p variables; the second procedure detects a shift in all the variables. The first scheme is based on an unbiased estimator for the shift in a particular Poisson count when input variables are not measurable. Run length results show that for most shift conditions this estimator is more effective in detecting a shift in one or two variables than using <b>multiple</b> <b>C</b> charts on the raw counts. The second scheme is based on the average of the p variables. Run length results show that its performance is equal to or better than the performance of <b>multiple</b> <b>C</b> charts on the raw counts.

40|$|Synaptic vesicle fusion {{in brain}} synapses occurs in phases {{that are either}} tightly coupled to action {{potentials}} (synchronous), immediately following action potentials (asynchronous), or as stochastic events {{in the absence of}} action potentials (spontaneous). Synaptotagmin- 1, - 2, and - 9 are vesicleassociated Ca 2 +sensors for synchronous release. Here we found that double C 2 domain (Doc 2) proteins act as Ca 2 +sensors to trigger spontaneous release. Although Doc 2 proteins are cytosolic, they function analogously to synaptotagmin- 1 but with a higher Ca 2 +sensitivity. Doc 2 proteins bound to N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complexes in competition with synaptotagmin- 1. Thus, different classes of <b>multiple</b> <b>C</b> 2 domain-containing molecules trigger synchronous versus spontaneous fusion, which suggests a general mechanism for synaptic vesicle fusion triggered by the combined actions of SNAREs and <b>multiple</b> <b>C</b> 2 domain-containing proteins...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) {{is still}} a major clinical challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated multiple distinct C. difficile strains in the faeces of patients with CDI; yet whether true mixed CDI occurs in vivo is unclear. In this study we evaluated whether two distinct C. difficile strains could co-germinate and co-proliferate in an in vitro human gut model. METHODS: An in vitro triple-stage chemostat was used to study the responses of two PCR ribotype 001 C. difficile strains following exposure to ceftriaxone at concentrations observed in vivo (7 days). C. difficile viable counts (vegetative and spore forms), cytotoxin titres and indigenous microflora viable counts were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Both C. difficile strains germinated and proliferated following exposure to ceftriaxone. Cytotoxin production was detected in the gut model following C. difficile spore germination and proliferation. Ceftriaxone elicited reduced viable counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and elevated viable counts of Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains are able to proliferate concurrently in an in vitro model reflective of the human colon. Previous studies in the gut model have reflected clinical observations so clinicians should be mindful {{of the possibility that}} <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains may infect patients.

40|$|Background: Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) {{is still}} a major challenge to healthcare facilities. The detection of <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains {{has been reported in}} some patient samples during initial and recurrent CDI episodes. However, the behaviour of individual strains and their contribution to symptomatic disease is unclear. Methods: An in vitro human gut model was used to investigate the germination and proliferation of two distinct C. difficile strains during initial and recurrent simulated CDI, as well as their response to vancomycin treatment. The gut model was inoculated with a pooled human faecal emulsion and indigenous gut microbiota, C. difficile populations (vegetative and spore forms), cytotoxin levels and antimicrobial activity were monitored throughout the experiment. Results: Both C. difficile strains germinated and proliferated in response to ceftriaxone instillation, with cytotoxin detected during the peak vegetative growth. Vancomycin instillation resulted in a rapid decline in the vegetative forms of both strains, with only spores remaining 2 days after the start of dosing. A recrudescence of both strains occurred following the cessation of vancomycin installation, although this was observed more quickly, and to a greater extent, in one strain than the other. Conclusions: Within a human gut model, <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains are able to germinate and proliferate con-currently in response to antibiotic challenge (the onset of simulated CDI).

40|$|Abstract—The {{research}} {{reported here}} integrates computational, visual, and cartographic methods {{to develop a}} geovisual analytic approach for exploring and understanding spatio-temporal and multivariate patterns. The developed methodology and tools can help analysts investigate complex patterns across multivariate, spatial, and temporal dimensions via clustering, sorting, and visualization. Specifically, the approach involves a self-organizing map, a parallel coordinate plot, several forms of reorderable matrices (including several ordering methods), a geographic small multiple display, and a 2 -dimensional cartographic color design method. The coupling among these methods leverages their independent strengths and facilitates a visual exploration of patterns {{that are difficult to}} discover otherwise. The visualization system we developed supports overview of complex patterns and, through a variety of interactions, enables users to focus on specific patterns and examine detailed views.

40|$|Cesium- 133 MAS NMR and X-ray powder {{diffraction}} {{have been}} used to investigate Cs+ ion-exchange in synthetic samples of the titanosilicate mineral, sitinakite. The effect of incorporating Nb using Nb(V) ethoxide as the Nb source into the sitinakite framework and its influence on Cs+ ion-exchange was also studied. Refinements of X-ray powder data show that substitution of niobium for titanium in the sitinakite framework occurs to a limited extent using the synthetic method employed. Niobium substitution is also supported by 29 Si MAS NMR spectra. Any niobium that was not substituted into the sitinakite structure was present in a distinct Nb-rich oxide/hydroxide phase. NMR studies reveal that in the undoped samples with low Cs loadings, at least four types of Cs+ are present, while at higher levels of Cs+ loadings, an additional two sites are populated. Similar sites appear to be occupied in the Nb-substituted samples but the relative occupancies are strongly modulated relative to the undoped samples.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is the {{predominant}} cause of antecedent infection in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) or Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). C. jejuni probably triggers GBS or MFS through molecular mimicry between bacterial sialylated lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) and gangliosides in peripheral nerve tissue. We investigated whether co-infections with <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> jejuni strains occur in GBS or MFS patients and we further characterized these strains. PFGE analysis of 83 C. jejuni isolates from single primary colonies from stool cultures of 13 patients with GBS or MFS revealed co-infection with two different strains in one patient (8 %). We showed that only strain GB 5. 1 contained an LOS biosynthesis gene locus that {{is associated with}} neuropathy. The patient serum strongly reacted with the LOS of strain GB 5. 1 and not with the LOS of strain GB 5. 2. Mass spectrometry revealed that both strains expressed a non-sialylated outer core structure in their LOS. The patient serum contained anti-asialo-GM 2 antibodies that cross-reacted with the LOS of strain GB 5. 1. This study demonstrates that co-infection with <b>multiple</b> <b>C.</b> jejuni strains occurs in GBS patients. Consequently, not all C. jejuni strains isolated from the faeces of a GBS patient are involved in the pathogenesis of GBS per se. Furthermore, this is the first report in which cross-reactivity of antibodies to asialo-GM 2 and to the LOS of a C. jejuni strain from a GBS patient has been demonstrated.
