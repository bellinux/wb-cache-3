Parallelism has been employed for many years, <b>mainly</b> <b>in</b> high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, <b>mainly</b> <b>in</b> the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
