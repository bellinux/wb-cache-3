Ørlandet Radio opened in 1952. Norway had twenty-seven coast radio station in 1953, of which five were located in Svalbard and Jan Mayen. Twelve only had a telephony service, while the remainder had both telegraphy and telephony. The maritime VHF radio system was introduced in 1956. Because of the limited range of VHF compared to MF, an additional forty unmanned stations were established, connected with a <b>manned</b> <b>station</b> with relays.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{commenced}} in September 1875 {{with the}} Main South Line junction located {{just north of}} Mosgiel station's yard, and although the line crossed mainly flat land, one engineering difficulty was presented by the Gladfield swamp. [...] A solid base {{could not be found}} even at a depth of twelve metres, and the problem was eventually solved by laying many layers of flax to provide a firm foundation for the line. [...] Two bridges were required during construction, the 67 metre Taieri River bridge near Outram, and a 42-metre bridge across the Silver Stream. [...] The line was remarkably straight: in its entire 14.5 kilometre length, it had a mere three curves. [...] Only one <b>manned</b> <b>station</b> and goods shed were built on the line, both at the terminus in Outram. [...] It was opened for service on 1 October 1877.|$|E
