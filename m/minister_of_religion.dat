5|$|Two years later, on Christmas Day, 1930, the family's first {{daughter}} was born, Margaret. Two more {{children were born}} to the family; Patricia in 1936, and Thomas in 1945. All three of them attended private schools: Patricia attended the Presbyterian Girls' College, becoming a teacher; and Margaret attended Methodist Ladies' College, later training as a child psychiatrist. The sixth Thomas wanted to attend university, but, like his forebears, was rebuked and worked on the orchard. Like a Playford before him, he became a <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in his later life.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Religion.</b>|$|E

As the villagers wanted him back, the prefect of the Aude reinstated Saunière. Between 1890-1891 he also said mass on Sundays in Antugnac.

25|$|Fagan {{was born}} in Tulbagh, a {{historical}} town in the winelands of the Cape Colony, in 1889. He was the oldest of seven children. His father was a lawyer and amateur poet, and kept a vast collection of books at the family's Cape Dutch residence (now a National Monument) on Kerk Straat, including leading works of theology and English literature. Fagan began his schooling in Tulbagh but completed the bulk of it in Somerset West. In 1905 he went to Victoria College (later to become the University of Stellenbosch), from which he earned a BA in Literature. He hoped (like many of his peers) to be a <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> {{and went to the}} seminary in Stellenbosch; but his father's long-standing wish was that he would become a barrister, and continued to pay for private lessons in law.|$|E

A number of officers of Epirote origin (not exceeding 30), as well as ordinary soldiers, deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries. Soon, armed groups, such as the [...] "Sacred Band" [...] or Spyromilios' men around Himarë (gr.

2500|$|... 10 December 1871, Empire, Pulpit Law (Kanzelparagraph) passed at the {{initiative}} of Bavaria and meant to curb what was considered the misuse of religious sermons for political agitation from the pulpit.

Then the negotiations were taken over by Stanisław Grabski, who represented the endecja faction, then dominant in the government. The negotiations between Grabski and Francesco Borgongini Duca spanned four months and 23 meetings in Rome.

2500|$|Lord Frederick Beauclerk was {{the leading}} [...] "amateur" [...] player of the Napoleonic period but he was {{notoriously}} mercenary, despite his status and his calling as an ordained <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> In 1806, he had {{the idea of a}} match between the amateurs and the professionals. To emphasise the social distance between the two, the amateur team would be called the Gentlemen and the paid professionals the Players. Even then, it was not a straight match because Beauclerk selected the two leading professional players Billy Beldham and William Lambert as [...] "given men" [...] for the Gentlemen. Thanks mainly to Lambert's contribution, the Gentlemen won. The match was not a success but Beauclerk organised a repeat two weeks later, also at Lord's. This time, only Lambert was a given man and Beldham joined the Players. The joint efforts of Beauclerk and Lambert earned another win for the Gentlemen. The seed for the long-running series had been planted but the fixture was not revived until 1819. Cricket was badly disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, especially between 1810 and 1814. The 1819 match was won by the Players, who had the unquestionably amateur Lord Strathavon as a [...] "given man", against a Gentlemen team that was all-amateur and included their best players Beauclerk, E. H. Budd and William Ward. As in 1806, the game attracted little interest but MCC were determined to persevere.|$|E
2500|$|Out of caution, Radić was {{quieter than}} usual at the {{following}} evening's session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Maštović then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radić made by Popović and Račić the previous day had gone unpunished {{by the president of}} the Assembly, Ninko Perić. Popović responded by saying [...] "...if Stjepan Radić, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall." [...] The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Perić ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Račić. Račić was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using [...] "other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom". Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Račić and shouting as he spoke. Račić demanded that Perić penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted [...] "you plundered beys!", accusing Račić of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Perić was not going to reprimand Pernar, Račić reached into his pocket and produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujičić, who was sitting behind the podium, grabbed Račić by the back while the former <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Religion,</b> Obradović, seized his right shoulder. Račić pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granđa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribićević just as HSS deputy Đuro Basariček jumped to the podium. Račić aimed at Pribićević but shot Basariček instead. He then shot Radić in the hand and stomach. Radić's nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Račić yelled [...] "I was waiting for you!" [...] and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariček and Radić's nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granđa were wounded but survived. Radić was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I.|$|E
