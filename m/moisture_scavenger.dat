40|$|The {{impact of}} excipients with high water {{affinity}} {{on the physical}} and chemical stability of a moisture sensitive active ingredient was evaluated. The active drug, theophylline anhydrous, was mixed {{with one or more}} excipients and subjected controlled humidity conditions for 30 to 120 days. X-ray diffraction was performed on the blends following storage {{in order to determine the}} conversion of theophylline anhydrous to theophylline monohydrate. ^ Conversion of theophylline anhydrous to theophylline monohydrate was evaluated based on excipients present in the formulations. Two diluents, hydrous lactose and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, were utilized, either alone or in combination. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, a binder in wet granulation processes, and fumed silica, a glidant and <b>moisture</b> <b>scavenger,</b> were also included in several blends. Both polyvinylpyrrolidone and fumed silica have high moisture affinity and are able to bring moisture into a formulation. The ability of these excipients to preferentially adsorb moisture in a formulation and protect theophylline anhydrous from hydration was addressed in this study. The formulations were found to have predictable results based on the excipients used. The type of diluent used in formulations containing fumed silica was found to be of particular importance. ^ The role of the excipients may also have a great effect on properties affecting tablet production. In order to determine if the blends studied would have properties allowing them to be easily tableted, functional parameters affecting powder flow were evaluated. The Carr Flowability Indices were utilized for this evaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} if {{poorly understood}} problem that hydrogels display is {{the tendency of}} these contact lens materials to dehydrate, causing certain complications of the corneal epithelium. However, recent {{studies have indicated that}} the evaporation rate of water from different hydrogel lenses is the same and the severity of conditions such as corneal staining is controlled by the states of water in the material. A study was therefore undertaken which concluded that increased corneal desiccating staining occurred as the proportion of water existing in the bound state decreased. The possibility of using dehydrated hydrogels as packaging materials with desiccating properties has also been investigated. As hydrogels have a high affinity for water they have adequate ability to function as a <b>moisture</b> <b>scavenger</b> in an enclosed atmosphere. It was concluded that this ability is maximised by a high total water content and an increase in the proportion of this water existing in the bound state for the material when it is fully hydrated. N-vinyl pyrrolidone has a low reactivity in vinyl polymerisation reactions which results in polymers with local domains of the same chemical type which can lead to deposition. As contact lenses comprising of this monomer are susceptible to deposition, a monomer with a higher reactivity in vinyl polymerisations is acryloylmorpholine and its incorporation in favour of NVP is encouraged. Unfortunately a large proportion of high EWC hydrogels are mechanically weak and attempts to increase this property by increasing hydrophobicity or cross-linking results in a decrease in EWC. Monomers with the potential to carry a positive charge were incorporated into a high EWC, AMO-HEMA copolymer and the physical properties were investigated. Although EWC increased, mechanical properties decreased only slightly. Therefore simultaneous incorporation of a positively charged monomer and a negatively charged monomer was investigated. The resulting copolymers showed increased water content and increased initial modulus. A technique for measuring the coefficient of friction of contact lenses during lubrication has been developed...|$|E
40|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{reveals the}} growing problem of food-borne illness around the world. Hundreds of {{millions}} of people worldwide are getting sick from contaminated food, because 1 / 3 - 1 / 2 of food products are not consumed (EC Directives 80 / 590 /EEC and 89 / 109 /EEC). Therefore, the preservation of food freshness and shelf life extension is important task for researchers around the world. In the last decade, much attention is paid to active and intelligent packaging investigation, development and practical application. Active packaging (AP) is defined as a type of packaging that changes the condition of the packaging to extend shelf life or to improve safety or sensory properties while maintaining the quality of the packaged food. Several AP systems have been widely reported, such as O 2 and ethylene <b>scavengers,</b> <b>moisture</b> regulators, CO 2 emitters, antioxidant and antimicrobial controlled-release packages, and devices to control the release or adsorption of flavours and odours [1]. Intelligent packaging (IP) is defined as technology that uses the packaging system communication function to monitor changes in the internal and external environments. IP aims to convey information to the stakeholders of the food supply chains (e. g., manufacturers, retailers, and consumers) related to the food's quality. Basically there are three intelligent systems: sensors, indicators and radiofrequency identification (RFID) [1]. The perspective goal for the future is the integration of several functions within only one device (multi-functional intelligent packaging), as well as the development of new functions...|$|R
40|$|The food systems {{slated for}} future NASA {{missions}} must meet crew nutritional needs, be acceptable for consumption, and use resources efficiently. Although the current food system of prepackaged, moderately stabilized food items {{works well for}} International Space Station (ISS) missions, many of the current space menu items do not maintain acceptability and/or nutritive value beyond 2 years. Longer space missions require that the food system can sustain the crew for 3 to 5 years without replenishment. The task "Integration of Product, Package, Process, and Environment: A Food System Optimization" has the objective of optimizing food-product shelf life for the space-food system through product recipe adjustments, new packaging and processing technologies, and modified storage conditions. Two emergent food processing technologies were examined to identify a pathway to stable, wet-pack foods without the detrimental color and texture effects. Both microwave-assisted thermal sterilization (MATS) and pressure-assisted thermal stabilization (PATS) were evaluated against traditional retort processing to determine if lower heat inputs during processing would produce a product with higher micronutrient quality and longer shelf life. While MATS products did have brighter color and better texture initially, the advantages were not sustained. The non-metallized packaging film used in the process likely provided inadequate oxygen barrier. No difference in vitamin stability was evident between MATS and retort processed foods. Similarly, fruit products produced using PATS showed improved color and texture through 3 years of storage compared to retort fruit, but the vitamin stability was not improved. The final processing study involved freeze drying. Five processing factors were tested in factorial design to assess potential impact of each {{to the quality of}} freeze-dried food, including the integrity of the microstructure. The initial freezing rate and primary freeze drying temperature and pressure were linked to final product quality in freeze-dried corn, indicating processing modifications that could lead to improved product shelf life. Storage temperatures and packaging systems were also assessed for the impact to food quality. Reduced temperature storage had inconclusive impact to the progression of rancidity in butter cookies. Frozen storage was detrimental to fruit and vegetable textural attributes but refrigerated storage helped to sustain color and organoleptic ratings for plant-based foods. With regard to packaging systems, the metallized film overwrap significantly decreased the progression of the rancidity of butter cookies as compared to the highest barrier non-metallized film. The inclusion of oxygen scavengers resulted in noticeable moisture gains in butter cookies over time, independent of packaging film systems. Neither emergent processing technology nor the freeze dry optimization resulted in compelling quality differences from current space food provisions such that a five-year shelf life is likely with these processing changes alone. Using a combination of refrigeration and PATS processing is expected to result in organoleptically-acceptable fruit quality for most fruits through five years. The vitamin degradation will be aided somewhat by the cold temperatures but, given the labile nature of vitamin C, a more stable fortification method, such as encapsulation, should also be investigated to ensure vitamin delivery throughout the product life. Similarly, significant improvement to the packaging film used in the MATS processing, optimization of formulation for dielectric properties, vitamin fortification, and reduced temperature storage should be investigated as a hurdle approach to reach a five year shelf life in wet-pack entrees and soups. Baked goods and other environmentally-sensitive spaceflight foods will require an almost impenetrable barrier to protect the foods from oxygen and <b>moisture</b> ingress but <b>scavengers</b> and reduced storage temperature did not improve baked good shelf life and are not recommended at this time for these foods...|$|R
