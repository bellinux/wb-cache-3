Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E

[...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way." [...] Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered {{the use of the}} Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.|$|E

In a season disrupted by injuries, Mendes only played in one more match for Braga, against his old club Vitória Guimarães. He had his contract cancelled in January 2003, which allowed him to join Moreirense. He made his debut on 3 February 2003 in a 1–1 draw at Benfica. He made two more appearances that season as the club finished 12th in the table. Having fractured his foot in July 2003, he was used sparingly during the 2003–04 season by manager Manuel Machado. He made four league appearances in an injury-plagued season, as the club finished 9th in the Primeira Liga. Mendes dropped down a division in June 2004 after signing a one-year contract with Santa Clara. [...] "This project is attractive," [...] he said. [...] "The coach, Jose Morais, spoke to me and showed willingness in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Azores and that's important.

500|$|Nurmi {{was married}} to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen from 1932 to 1935. Laaksonen, who was not {{interested}} in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, [...] "is concentration on athletics at last forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the judge for a divorce." [...] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a [...] "self-made" [...] businessman. Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed [...] "uneasy". Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career. As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equaled his father's time. In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the [...] "three Olavis" [...] (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.

500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E

After the Great Exhibition closed in 1852, its principal building, known as [...] "the Crystal Palace", was dismantled and rebuilt in the south London suburb of Sydenham as a centre for education, the arts and leisure. Grove was appointed secretary of the Crystal Palace. He engaged a wind band and a conductor, Heinrich Schallehn. The latter was found to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by August Manns, who, with Grove's encouragement, developed the band into a full-sized symphony orchestra. With programmes chosen by Grove and Manns, the Crystal Palace concerts became a central feature of London's musical scene and remained so until the end of the century. Grove wrote the programme notes for the concerts. In 1901, a biographer wrote: ...|$|E
