In the other experiment, NS was added to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm in a completely randomized design. Results showed that the application of 100 and 150 ppm NS both as an immersion and as added directly to the culture medium significantly reduces internal and external contaminations compared with the control group. Using NS in culture medium was more efficient to reduce fungal and bacterial contamination than immersion. High concentrations of NS had an adverse effect on the viability of G×N 15 single nodes and this effect was more serious in immersed explants in NS than directly added NS ones regarding the viability of buds and plantlet regeneration.

Experiments on in vitro propagation and rooting of stem cuttings were carried out. Dipping stem cuttings in half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media for 12 h prior to application of rooting hormones improved bud break and prolonged survival of stem cuttings on a mist bed. Early leaf loss was observed for stem cuttings planted without MS treatment. However, rooting was poor (11 % for cuttings pre-treated in MS and 0 % for those not pre-treated). For <b>micro-propagation,</b> significant differences (P < 0. 05) in shoot multiplication and root regeneration were found. MS media supplemented with 2. 0 mg l– 1 benzylaminopurine was superior {{in the number of}} micro-shoots produced. Rooting capacity of micro-cuttings was improved from 42 % to 64 % when MS media supplemented with 0. 5 mg l– 1 IBA were repeated for the micro-cuttings that initially failed to root. There was 70 % survival rate of plantlets after hardened off.

40|$|Primers were {{designed}} to reveal pararetrovirus-like sequences from potato (Solanum tuberosum) by PCR. One primer pair covered {{an area of the}} reverse transcriptase region, others covered the end of a transactivator and a repetitive region. The sequences obtained ranged from 800 to 1100 bp and had homology to known sequences of TPV (tobacco pararetrovirus) and TVCV (Tobacco vein clearing virus). Aligning the sequences from the potato genome gave a phylogenetic clustering into three different groups. Genomic Southern hybridization was used to confirm the results, with probes hybridizing to the full length of the digested DNA. In situ hybridization was used to localize different pararetrovirus-like sequences to the chromosomes of potato, which showed a low copy number sequence dispersed throughout the genome.;A diverse range of plant species was analysed with the pararetrovirus-like primers, and clones homologous to TPV and TVCV were obtained from a liverwort, a fern, tomato, tobacco, pea, rice and banana. These results were confirmed with genomic Southern hybridization, which also revealed pararetrovirus-like sequences in the DNA of other lower plants, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.;Integrated pararetroviruses {{have been found to be}} a serious problem in banana breeding as <b>micro-propagation</b> may give rise to episomal viruses, reducing the yield considerably. The possibility of the widespread presence of pararetrovirus-like sequences in plants may have important implications for virus resistance, sudden pathogen outbreak and genomic evolution...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{tissue culture}} is an {{inevitable}} technique to overcome healthy and limited planting materials problems using suitable energy sources. Different carbohydrates have diverse effect on in vitro growing plantlets {{in terms of}} growth performance, acclimatization and cost used for <b>micro-propagation.</b> Hence, this paper reports the effects of sucrose, fructose, glucose, table sugar and starch on pineapple in vitro mass propagation and acclimatization {{as well as the}} analysis of energy source required cost per a medium. A complete randomized design was used to compare analytic grade sucrose with other four energy sources at 2 and 3 % (w/v). The results revealed that the energy sources with varied concentration strongly influenced the in vitro growth and subsequent acclimatization of pineapple plantlets. Analytic grade sucrose and table sugar at 3 % performed well for in vitro survival rate (100 %), shoot amplification (15. 3 - 16. 5 shoots), rooting ability (2. 5 cm long and 12 roots) and acclimatization (95. 4 - 97 %). However, fructose and glucose required high importation cost (229. 1 % and 121. 9 % over analytic grade sucrose, respectively), and have low growth and acclimatization performance next to starch and energy free medium. Thus, table sugar has found to be a suitable alternative energy source for pineapple mass propagation, which saved about 95 - 97 % cost from that of laboratory grade sucrose...|$|E
