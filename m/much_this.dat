5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E

25|$|By 1971, the yen {{had become}} undervalued.

In 1772, Commander Fernando de Leyba was ordered to assert dominance over the local French and {{to reduce the amount}} of feasts and gifts for the local Quapaw, as it was costing the colonial government too <b>much.</b> <b>This</b> brought the Spanish close to hostilities with the Quapaw, but eventually Commander Leyba conceded the goods and conflict was avoided.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{activity}} of bridges during the Middle Ages {{is directly related}} to the need of restoring the old Roman road system that was already obsolete, in order to develop new connections and boost trading. Since the end of the 11th century that need was so urgent that building bridges and restoring the paveways were activities that started to be considered as pious. São Gonçalo of Amarante and São Lourenço Mendes, sponsors of the construction of Amarante and Cavês bridges, respectively, were called saints by popular acclamation, such as Saint Benizet of Avignon (France) or Sán Domingos da Calçada (La Rioja (Spain)), showing how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon of bridge and road construction were considered extremely important elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} is {{an expression}} of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy is a measure of how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the maximum entropy production principle. It states that non-equilibrium systems behave {{such a way as to}} maximize its entropy production.|$|E
500|$|In North America, {{house sparrow}} populations are more {{differentiated}} {{than those in}} Europe. This variation follows predictable patterns, with birds at higher latitudes being larger and those in arid areas being paler. However, [...] how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> is caused by evolution or by environment is not clear. Similar observations {{have been made in}} New Zealand, and in South Africa. The introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status, especially in North America and southern Africa, and American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser even gave the subspecies name P. d. plecticus to the paler birds of western North America.|$|E

500|$|Emily Heward of Music OMH called [...] "Jai Ho" [...] an [...] "exuberant Bollywood dance number" [...] that [...] "encapsulates the film's feel-good-factor, and {{reminds us}} just how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> score deserves the accolades {{it has already}} won and the many it is sure still to receive– just as India's most treasured {{composer}} deserves the new-found global recognition it has earned him". In {{a review of the}} Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack, Joginder Tutej of Bollywood Hungama deemed [...] "Jai Ho" [...] the [...] "flagship number" [...] of the film. Tutej complimented Sukhwinder Singh's vocals as being [...] "energetic" [...] and concluded that the singer [...] "can comfortably add on another big chartbuster to his name". He also stated that the song, while [...] "boasting of an amazing mix of melody and rhythm" [...] remains [...] "Indian at heart" [...] and is [...] "instantly catchy". He concluded that: [...] "No wonder, it is the lone promotional song of the film and also sees a music video being dedicated to it.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Born This Way" [...] {{was met with}} {{generally}} positive reception among music critics.

[...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote that the fantasy aspects of the video is overshadowed by the overall spectacle, which he believed was analogous to Gaga, [...] "after thoroughly dominating this world with 'Born This Way,' [...] seems content to create brand-new worlds to tower over." [...] Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery, was extreme in the video. Raphael Chestang from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video, also complimenting the fashion. Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984), while believing it to be [...] "more of a high-fashion short film than a conventional music video". Jim Farber from New York Daily News wanted Gaga to add more humor in her videos, adding that although the video had [...] "joyous" [...] shock value, it definitely lacked creativity.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Vulture, Scott Meslow gave [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] 4 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "as the Marvel Cinematic Universe {{has gotten}} bigger and weirder, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gotten bigger and better, and [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] {{is a strong}} premiere that shows off just how <b>much</b> <b>this</b> TV series has evolved." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, with his {{highlights}} the reveal that Simmons is on another planet, which would allow the series interesting story opportunities. Conversely, Sava felt elements of the episode were too procedural and [...] "a surplus of infodumps that drag the pacing," [...] and, unlike Goldman, felt leaving out May and Ward was [...] "a big reason why this premiere is an underwhelming reintroduction to this world." [...] He concluded, [...] "There’s lots of potential for this season to address the moral complications of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s mission, and hopefully the writers will use the themes of Civil War to explore the murky ethics of capturing and holding superpowered people against their will ... the transition into the age of Inhumanity {{may be a little}} rocky, but there’s enough substance in this premiere to suggest a promising season ahead." [...] Meslow and Sava both indicated their pleasure in the introduction of Joey Gutierrez, who Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey.
