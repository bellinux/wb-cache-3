50|$|In {{order to}} produce a <b>mortar</b> <b>joint,</b> the mason must use one of several types of jointers (slickers), rakes, or beaders. These tools are run through the grout in between the {{building}} material before the grout is solid and create the desired outcome the mason seeks.|$|E
50|$|Before {{commercial}} wall plugs, fixings {{were made}} to brick or masonry walls by chiselling a groove into a soft <b>mortar</b> <b>joint,</b> hammering in a crude wooden plug and then attaching to the wooden plug.

5000|$|Although good-quality bricks may outlast civilizations, {{the mortar}} that bonds them can crack and crumble {{after a number}} of years.

For maintenance, degraded <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> need to be renewed by removing the old mortar and applying new mortar, a process known as [...] "repointing".|$|R
50|$|During the 18th and 19th centuries, British {{bricklayers}} {{became aware}} that, by thickening the vertical <b>mortar</b> <b>joint</b> between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former' or over specially constructed timber falsework (temporary structure {{to be removed}} once the construction is complete).

50|$|While {{most popular}} during America’s Colonial period, this design is often {{replicated}} in newer brickwork. It is created with a grapevine jointer, {{which is a}} metal blade with a raised bead that creates an indented line {{in the center of}} the <b>mortar</b> <b>joint.</b> These lines are often rough and wavy, simulating the generally straight yet slightly irregular appearance of a grapevine.

40|$|Synopsis: The {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} un-reinforced masonry walls strengthened with externally bonded unidirectional composite laminates and subjected to out-of-plane loading is investigated. The model is based on variational principles, static equilibrium, and compatibility between the structural components, which include the masonry units (blocks), the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints,</b> the FRP strips, and the adhesive layers. The modeling of the masonry block and the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> follows the small displacements and the Bernoulli-Euler beam theories. The strengthening FRP strips are modeled following the lamination theory and the adhesive layers are modeled as two dimensional linear elastic continuum. The effects of cracking of the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> and the debonding of the composite laminates near the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> are also considered. A numerical example is presented. The numerical results quantitatively describe some of the phenomena that govern {{the behavior of the}} strengthened wall and may lead to its failure. A summary and conclusions close the paper...|$|R
50|$|In masonry, <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the spaces}} between bricks, {{concrete}} blocks, or glass blocks, that are filled with mortar or grout. If {{the surface of the}} masonry remains unplastered, the joints contribute significantly to the appearance of the masonry. <b>Mortar</b> <b>joints</b> can be made in a series of different fashions, but the most common ones are raked, grapevine, extruded, concave, V, struck, flush, weathered and beaded.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{material}} properties of unreinforced masonry (URM) such as the flexural tensile strength of <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> and bricks and torsional shear bond strengths of the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints,</b> to name a few, vary considerably from joint to joint and brick to brick, even within the same wall. Furthermore, it {{is well known}} that this spatial variability might significantly affect the structural performance and reliability of URM walls. The paper develops a computational method to predict the strength for URM walls subject to one-way horizontal bending considering unit-to-unit spatial variability of <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> and bricks. In this context, the term “unit” is being used to describe the location in the wall associated with a single brick and the adjacent <b>mortar</b> <b>joints.</b> In this way, the material properties are assumed to be uniform along the length, height and thickness of individual bricks but may vary from brick to brick within the wall. Tensile strength, shear bond strength and associated fracture energies of the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints,</b> and tensile strength and fracture energy of the bricks are the main parameters considered herein. We examine how spatial variability in unit strengths (<b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> and bricks) affect the variability of ultimate strength and damage progression of clay brick URM walls in one-way horizontal bending. Stochastic analysis in the form of Monte Carlo simulations used a 3 -D nonlinear Finite Element Analysis. The results were validated from a database of available experimental results on masonry four course beams. It was found that good agreement of peak load exists between the stochastic simulation and the experimental results for the four course beam subject to horizontal bending...|$|R
50|$|Poor {{repointing}} work often {{raises the}} level of the <b>mortar</b> <b>joint</b> above the face of the masonry unit, which causes the mortar edge to feather. Such a process is aesthetically undesirable and can cause performance problems as a thin layer of mortar will quickly erode. In addition, depending {{on the nature of the}} mortar, mortar that rises above {{the level of}} the face of the masonry unit can participate in damaging the arris or corner of the masonry unit. In these cases, deteriorated mortar is often not removed to a sufficient depth.|$|E

50|$|Bricks, stone blocks, {{and other}} masonry units are {{typically}} laid {{in a bed}} of mortar.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{sheds light}} into {{the effect of the}} {{periodic}} pattern of bricks and <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> on the load-carrying capacity of the interface between fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites and masonry. Two simplified cohesive material laws are proposed for the FRP-mortar and FRP-brick interfaces, which allow for the computation in closed form of a finite effective bond length Leff of the interfaces. The aforementioned simplified interfacial laws are employed to compute the load response of the FRP-masonry interface, and to obtain the interfacial shear stress, the FRP axial strain, and the slip profiles along the bonded length. The results indicate that length of the stress-transfer zone (LSTZ) of the FRP-masonry interface varies periodically as its location shifts with respect to the position of the <b>mortar</b> <b>joints.</b> Furthermore LSTZ can be different from the effective length b effL of the FRP-brick interface and is influenced {{by the size of the}} bricks and <b>mortar</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rushmore {{farmhouse}} is a -story, six-bay-wide by two-bay-deep stone residence surmounted by a steeply pitched gable roof. Interior stone chimneys {{pierce the}} gable ends.

The façade appears to have been whitewashed at one time and there are large areas where the original mortar has been replaced with Portland cement.

Two gabled dormers on the south elevation were added at a later, unknown date.|$|E
50|$|The Lafayette Building's {{steel frame}} is encased with {{concrete}} and brick, collectively {{selected by the}} architects for their fireproof qualities. The first story of the building, which contains retail space, is clad in black granite, while the upper levels are faced with smooth light grey limestone on the street-front elevations. Less costly brick faces the alley and courtyard elevations. Regularly spaced square windows with one-over-one, double-hung configurations dominate all elevations and are slightly recessed to avoid interruption of the wall plane. Bronze is used liberally {{on the first two}} stories, forming spandrels that divide the first and second levels, window frames, entrance doors, shop fronts, and select railings. Simple recessed panels at select ends of the building run the full height of the main mass and suggest plain classically inspired pilasters.

He built almost exclusively with basalt at that time, a black or grey rock available in the local hills. Basalt is a hard volcanic rock, it weathers very well, but is somewhat difficult to cut. Frazer and his masons split and chiseled the stone, making a roughly squared face. These blocks were set in courses on the building facades that faced the streets. The blocks were then finished around the edges with black-dyed mortar and joined by a white <b>mortar</b> <b>joint,</b> giving a squared look to the slightly irregular edges.

40|$|The {{moisture}} transport in {{mortar and}} <b>mortar</b> <b>joint</b> often {{is an important}} parameter in degeneration of brick masonry and other block constructions. In this study, the influence of single additives on the moisture transport properties of mortar is investigated. Due to water extraction during brick laying, curing conditions of mortar in <b>mortar</b> <b>joint</b> differ from curing conditions of separately cured mortar. Consequently, the moisture transport properties of <b>mortar</b> <b>joint</b> differ.

40|$|Thermal bridges in {{building}} walls are usually caused by <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> between insulated building blocks {{and by the}} presence of concrete columns and beams within the building envelope. These bridges create an easy path for heat transmission and therefore increase air-conditioning loads. In this study, the effects of <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> only on cooling and heating loads in a typical two-story villa in Riyadh are investigated using whole building energy analysis. All loads found in the villa, which broadly include ventilation, transmission, solar and internal loads, are considered with schedules based on local lifestyles. The thermal bridging effect of <b>mortar</b> <b>joints</b> is simulated by reducing wall thermal resistance by a percentage that depends on the bridges to wall area ratio (TB area ratio or Amj/Atot) and the nominal thermal insulation thickness (Lins). These percentage reductions are obtained from a correlation developed by using a rigorous 2 D dynamic model of heat transmission through walls with <b>mortar</b> <b>joints.</b> The reduction in thermal resistance is achieved through minor reductions in insulation thickness, thereby keeping the thermal mass of the wall essentially unchanged. Results indicate that yearly and monthly cooling loads increase almost linearly with the thermal bridge to wall area ratio. The increase in the villa’s yearly loads varies from about 3 % for Amj/Atot = 0. 02 to about 11 % for Amj/Atot = 0. 08. The monthly increase is not uniform over the year and reaches a maximum in August, where it ranges from 5 % for Amj/Atot = 0. 02 to 15 % for Amj/Atot = 0. 08. In winter, results show that yearly heating loads are generally very small compared to cooling loads and that heating is only needed in December, January and February, starting from late night to late morning. Monthly heating loads increase with the thermal bridge area ratio; however, the variation is not as linear as observed in cooling loads.
