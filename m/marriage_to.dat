5|$|However, Dot causes {{trouble for}} certain {{residents}} too, although not intentionally. She {{is responsible for}} the break-up of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due to the lack of lust in his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> Naima, Saeed begins visiting prostitutes. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him.|$|E

5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> Side before his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E

5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> James, which caused much gossip.

Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E
