In comparison, <b>mobile</b> <b>telecommunication</b> uptake in Sarawak was comparable to the national average, 93.3% against a national average of 94.2%, and on par with neighbouring Sabah. <b>Mobile</b> <b>telecommunication</b> infrastructure, specifically broadcast towers, are built and managed by SacofaSdnBhd (Sacofa Private Limited), which enjoys a monopoly in Sarawak after the company was granted a 20-year exclusivity deal on the provision, maintenance and leasing of towers in the state.|$|E

40|$|In this paper,we {{explore the}} short-run and long-run {{contribution}} of five indicators {{of information and}} communication technology(ICT) on economic growth of China over the sample period 1980 – 2013. We use the augmented Solow(1956) framework, the ARDL bounds (Pesaran, Shin,& Smith, 2001) approach to cointegration and the Todaand Yamamoto (1995) Granger non-causality tests to examine the possible linkages. The results show evidence of long-run association among level variables for all the indicators of ICT. From the results, we also note that all the indicators of ICT have a positive and statistically significant elasticity coefficient ranging from 0. 010 to 0. 080. From the Granger causality results, we note bidirectional causality between <b>mobile</b> cellular, <b>telecommunication</b> and economic growth; and between <b>mobile</b> cellular, <b>telecommunication</b> and capital per worker, respectively. Other results indicate that fixed broadband cause capital accumulation; capital accumulation causes internet technology. We also note bidirectional causality between <b>mobile</b> cellular and <b>telecommunication,</b> and between fixed broadband and internet, respectively; and a unidirectional causality from internet and fixed broad-band to hi-tech exports; and from <b>mobile</b> cellular and <b>telecommunication</b> to fixed broadband, respectively. From the overall results, within caveats, we highlight that while all the indicators of ICT are imperative for long-run growth, besides capital per worker, the dominant technology drivers are mobile cellular and telecommunications technology...|$|R
