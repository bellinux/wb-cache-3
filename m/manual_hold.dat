In addition, Hollick advocated heavily for the physiological necessity of sex in consenting adults, regardless of marital status. He insisted that sex was an organic expression of human nature, citing the act as [...] "...the highest and most absorbing excitement that animated beings can experience".

There was a change in grip force when subjects heard verbs that related to manual action.

40|$|Protective Maternity Legislation (PML) for {{pregnant}} workers {{is well established}} in Italy and France, but {{little is known about}} the way it fulfils some of its aims, such as the protection of mothers' and babies' health and of the rights of women workers. In this paper, we present the results of two surveys, one carried out in Italy and the other in France, concerned with the implementation of these regulations. Results show that women who were regularly employed generally could benefit from PML, while non-eligible workers, most of them <b>holding</b> <b>manual</b> jobs, were not protected at all. Among eligible workers, inequalities existed: women with less qualified jobs and those employed in the private sector were less likely to benefit from the protective measures considered. A number of specific measures, such as the possibility of taking an early maternity leave for work reasons and of being moved to another job within the same firm were underused in both countries. Some limitations of PML are discussed, namely the fact it covers some but not all pregnant workers, that it ignores domestic work and the tendency to remove the pregnant worker rather than to modify her working conditions. pregnant workers social inequalities Protective Maternity Legislation Italy and France...|$|R

This thesis addresses this need through {{the design of a}} table that can attach to a <b>manual</b> wheelchair to <b>hold</b> food and drink. The table is engineered to be lightweight, small enough to fit in a backpack, hold a wine glass, and prevent food from sliding off its surface when the wheelchair goes over bumps. The thesis documents the design of the table- it is a simple, contemporary design made primarily of aluminum and vinyl. Preliminary mockups were built to test and refine the table concept and key details, while a detailed digital model for the final design was developed.

40|$|Recently, {{with the}} advent of the 7 th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging manual, at least one set of {{criteria}} (e. g. breast) were modified to now require the measurement of maximal depth of stromal invasion. With the current manual interpretive morphological approaches typically employed by surgical pathologists to assess tumor extent, the specialty now potentially has stumbled upon a crossroads of practice, where the diagnostic criteria have exceeded the capabilities of our commonly available tools. While whole slide imaging (WSI) technology holds the potential to offer many improvements in clinical workflow over conventional slide microscopy including unambiguous utility for facilitating quantitative diagnostic tasks with one important example being the determination of both linear dimension and surface area. However, the availability of histology data in digital form is of little utility if time-consuming and cumbersome manual workflow steps are necessarily imposed upon the pathologist in order to generate such measurements, especially as encountered with the complex and ill-defined shapes inherent to infiltrative tumors. In this communication, we demonstrate the utility of the recently described SIVQ algorithm to serve as the basis of a highly accurate, precise and semi-automated tool for direct surface area measurement of tumor infiltration from WSI data sets. By anticipating the current trend in cancer staging that emphasizes increasingly precise feature characterization, as witnessed by the recent publication of AJCC's 7 th edition of the Cancer Staging <b>Manual,</b> this tool <b>holds</b> promise to will be of value to pathologists for clinical utility...|$|R
40|$|Physical, studio-based skill {{learning}} is being curtailed in Australian universities and studio activities are being lost across the university curricula. Indeed, academic managers are constantly reducing {{the time spent}} in skill-based physical activities by expanding compulsory student time spent in textual and digital communication activities. Sensorimotor or bodily-kinesthetic development and cognitive or spatial development are inextricably linked. The <b>manual</b> skill of <b>holding</b> a marking tool and learning spatially to write defines the entire edifice of academic thought and communication. The simplistic notion that we only have to write about something misses the profound importance of learning complex bodilykinesthetic, visual, phenomenological, interpersonal and creative skills. In this paper I argue the need for visual and physical studio-based units to be included across the academic sector and explore why academic managers have so poorly served manual learning activities, beholden {{as they are to}} working and communicating from a computer. This lack of care and awareness from academic managers is leading to a lack of understanding and respect within contemporary Australian academe to the essential and central importance of non-textual knowledge constructs and literacies. The thrust of this argument is directed at the entire undergraduate curricula. I assert that the integration and implementation of creative and visual studio-based units across the undergraduate cohort would have resounding impact on the work of postgraduate students. It would also open up whole areas of active research. As an essential part of this work, I also address the impact of digital technology on the university curriculum and posit that the all-invasive use of the computer is causing remarkable shortsightedness in what is regarded as legitimate academic activity...|$|R

Cognitive models have been increasingly successful at accounting for complex data sets on problem-solving (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998; Meyer & Kieras, 1997; Pew & Mavor, 1998). Largely, these cognitive models have focused on reaction time and accuracy and usually only final times and accuracies. These models often specify rather complex sequences of unseen processes taking place over many seconds. Even when the pattern of data they fit is correspondingly complex, one is naturally wary about a chain of inferences about unseen processes. It would be better if we could have data about these intervening processes. Basically, more converging data would be better.

Few studies have investigated which diseases contribute to existing socioeconomic mortality differences in specific age groups and none were in samples of the whole population, where selection bias is minimized. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine which causes of death contribute the most to social inequalities in mortality in each age group in the whole population of Scania, Sweden. Methods Data from LOMAS (Longitudinal Multilevel Analysis in Skåne) were used to estimate 12 -year follow-up mortality rates across levels of socioeconomic position (SEP) and workforce participation in 975, 938 men and women aged 0 to 80 years, during 1991 – 2002. Results The results generally showed increasing absolute mortality differences between those <b>holding</b> <b>manual</b> and non-manual occupations with increasing age, while there were inverted u-shaped associations when using relative inequality measures. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) contributed to 52 % of the male socioeconomic difference in overall mortality, cancer to 18 %, external causes to 4 % and psychiatric disorders to 3 %. The corresponding contributions in women were 55 %, 21 %, 2 % and 3 %. Additionally, those outside the workforce (i. e., students, housewives, disability pensioners, and the unemployed) showed a strongly increased risk of future mortality in all age groups compared to those inside the workforce. Even though coronary heart disease (CHD) played a major contributing role to the mortality differences seen, stroke and other types of cardiovascular diseases also made substantial contributions. Furthermore, while the most common types of cancers made substantial contributions to the socioeconomic mortality differences, in some age groups more than half of the differences in cancer mortality could be attributed to rarer cancers. Conclusion CHD made a major contribution to the socioeconomic differences in overall mortality.

40|$|The {{following}} master's thesis discusses {{a rather}} unexplored {{topic in the}} sphere of preschool education. With the application of a historical paradigm, I illustrated how women's role in the society has been changing through the course of history, and how these changes affected the perception of children, and the development of preschool education in Slovenia. At first the position of women and men were equal; in some cases women even had greater influence and power than men. However, new social foundations feudalism relied upon changed the position of women {{in such a way that}} women became inferior to men. In the Middle Ages the Christian Church also treated women with contempt. Due to the development of industrialization and capitalism women were forced to leave their homes to go to work. These changes contributed to the need for the establishment of childcare facilities for those children whose mothers were employed, and these facilities were also preparing children for work. The first steps toward organized preschooling in Slovenia go back to 1041 when a wealthy citizen and a trader Pavel Berlach established an orphanage. In the 19 th century most of Slovene children were born, nurtured and raised at home. The organization of families based on patriarchy with strict hierarchical relationships. This was the time when Slovene women started developing awareness about their inferiority and were supported by the feminist movement to fight the existing social system and the regime. After the Second World War the role of women in the society drastically changes in the social, political, economic and societal sphere. Educational program for upbringing and childcare was introduced in the kindergartens that brought a unified system of kindergartens for all children in the local community. In 1999 a Curriculum for kindergartens was approved, which is still in use today. The profession of kindergarten teachers of preschool children is feminized, for it is primarily performed by women. Modern mothers are burdened with the demand of being good mothers, who raise and educate their children on one hand and are with the personal desires to pursue a career on the other. Being afraid of not succeeding these mothers seek advice of different experts, read instructions found in magazines for parents and educational <b>manuals.</b> Social expectations <b>hold</b> a predominant belief that motherhood is still women's priority, therefore women with no children are stigmatized. ...|$|R
