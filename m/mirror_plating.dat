40|$|Abstract − We {{considered}} the uniformity of fabricated micromirror arrays by characterizing the fabrication process and calculating the appropriate driving voltages of micromirrors used as virtual photomask in maskless photolithography. The uniformity of the micromirror array {{in terms of}} driving voltage and optical characteristics is adversely affected by factors, such as the air gap between the bottom electrode and the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> the spring shape and the deformation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> or torsion spring. The thickness deviation of the photoresist sacrificial layer, the misalignment between <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> and bottom electrode, the aluminum deposition condition used to produce the spring and the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> and initial <b>mirror</b> deflection were identified as key factors. Their importance {{lies in the fact}} that they are related to air gap deviations under the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> asymmetric driving voltages in left and right mirror directions, and the deformation of the Al spring or <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> after removal of the sacrificial layer. The plasma ashing conditions used for removing the sacrificial layer also contributed to the deformation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> and spring.

Several new design variants have been fabricated, characterized and are compared with devices of the previous design comprising quadratic <b>mirror</b> <b>plates.</b> The advantage of lower inertial moment favours the circular and elliptic design of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate.</b> The capacity variation has been increased significantly by a special arrangement of the driving electrode fingers.

40|$|The use of microscanning mirrors {{in mobile}} laser {{projection}} systems demands for robust fabrication technologies.

This technology allows the fabrication of stacked combdrives for electrostatic mirror actuation and lateral feedthroughs needed for hermetic encapsulation with standard wafer bonding processes. High display resolution requires large scan angles of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate.</b> Therefore, a fabrication technology for structured glass wafers is presented to provide deep cavities for large <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> movements.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns quasistatic torsional mirror's for optical applications. The intended {{main area}} of application is the use as switch in optical network's, replacing the conventional optical-electro-optical conversation. With these actuator's a new concept of electrostatic actuation has been realised. While the drive electrodes are integrated into the deflectable mirror, the whole counter electrode below the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> remains at equal ground potential. The device is manufactured out of two parts using method's of silicon bulk mikro machining. A deflectable <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> torsional spring's and the surrounding support structure are fabricated within the thin device layer {{at the top of}} BSOI material. The counter electrode is manufactured out of a highly doped silicon wafer. Both part's are assembled together by adhesive bonding at die level at the end. Since the driving potential is supplied to the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> and the counter electrode is at ground level, lateral tolerances because of device assembly mismatches does not appear {{with the use of the}} new concept. In detail the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> itself is divided into two seperate electrodes by a parallel arrangement of filled isolating trenches. The highly doped device layer provides electrical connection via the torsional spring's to the mirror electrodes. A quasistatic torsional actuation is performed if a dc-voltage is applied between one mirror side and the counter electrode. Several design's have been fabricated. The lateral dimension of the torsional <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> vary from 0, 5 mm to 2, 0 mm. The designed characteristic frequencies vary from 0, 5 to 3 kHz. For quasistatic actuation the pull in angle vary from 1 to 5 degree and the pull in voltage goes up to several hundred volts. Accessorily the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> is enclosed by a comb drive structure. So that the device could be used for low voltage resonant actuation or an capacitive position read out becomes feasible. Within this thesis the new concept has been verified and functionality has been demonstrated. Depending on their characteristic frequency, devices are suitable to perform quasistatic actuation within 10 ms. Experiments indicated that the electrical isolation damages irreversible at drive voltage's above 400 volt. It limits the maximum deflection of nearly all design's. At prototype actuators repeatability has been studied. No drift was observed in the static characteristic within several cycles for certain designs. Closed-loop position control is not mandatory for the actuators fabricated within this thesis. Mechanical stress inside the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> causes deformation of the reflective surface larger than permitted by optical criteria.

40|$|A high {{performance}} micro scanner {{is a critical}} element to enable efficient beamsteering in miniature laser projection displays. Such scanner requires a large mirror size, large scan angles, and a high frequency to ensure good optical resolutions. However, these conditions also induce large dynamic deformations on the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> resulting in optical aberrations. This dissertation describes a new design of two-dimensional micro scanner with good dynamic atness. The design targeted to achieve a resolution analogue to VGA video requirements (640 pixels x 480 pixels) with a modulation transfer function (MTF) value of 0. 5. Another portion of the dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} fracture strength investigations of single crystal silicon torsion springs. The fracture strength knowledge will contribute to the design of a reliable micro scanner under high frequency, large angle actuation conditions. The demonstrated two-dimensional micro scanner has a high horizontal scanning frequency of 30. 84 kHz and a low vertical scanning frequency of 335 Hz. It has two special features to enhance the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> atness: 1. the backside islands to increase rigidity and 2. the multiple-joint torsion springs to evenly distribute forces onto the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate.</b> A novel DRIE-TMAH combination process was developed to fabricate the backside islands with an average height of 86 um and > 96 % within-wafer uniformity. When operated with a mechanical scan angle of 4. 8 °, the 1 mm diameter <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> had a root-mean-square dynamic deformation of 13. 86 nm. This translates to a 25 nm deformation at +- 10 °, which is less than 1 / 20 wavelength of the 635 nm light source. The MTF of the scanner was calculated based on the deformations and proved the scanner's ability to achieve a VGA resolution with 0. 5 MTF. Another part of the dissertation documents the findings of the fractures strength experiments performed with single crystal silicon torsion springs. Three types of specimens with different sizes and stress distributions were fabricated for the experiments. The specimens were actuated to different angles to determine the stress levels at which the springs fracture. Fitting the fractures stress data with a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, the characteristic stresses of the three specimen types were found to be 3. 10 GPa, 2. 51 GPa, and 4. 76 GPa. Among them, the design with the highest stress concentration and lowest surface roughness exhibits the highest fracture strength. This indicates a high stress concentration to be desirable for torsion spring designs. A normalized characteristic stress was implemented to attempt the fracture strength prediction of a new device.
