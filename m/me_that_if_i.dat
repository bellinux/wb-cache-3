500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lundgren {{has said}} that, as a child, he was {{insecure}} and suffered from allergies, describing {{himself as a}} [...] "runt". He showed {{a keen interest in}} drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star. At age seven, he tried judo and Gōjū-ryū. He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that [...] "My dad always told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America." [...] After graduating from high school with straight As, he spent some time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering at Washington State University and Clemson University. He studied chemical engineering for a year at Washington State University, [...] prior to serving his mandatory one year in the Swedish Marine Corps at the Amphibious Ranger School. [...] In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. The name [...] "Dolph" [...] comes from a distant relative of one of his first hamsters.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} some early {{supporters}} of Joyce's work, such as Ezra Pound and the author's brother Stanislaus Joyce, had grown increasingly unsympathetic {{to his new}} writing. In {{order to create a}} more favourable critical climate, a group of Joyce's supporters (including Samuel Beckett, William Carlos Williams, Rebecca West and others) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work. It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. In July 1929, increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving, Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of his completing the book. Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had [...] "explained to [...] all about the book, at least a great deal, and he promised <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> found it madness to continue, in my condition, and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth." [...] Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds, as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce, exactly one week later, and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter-ego Stephen Dedalus. In the end, Stephens was not asked to finish the book.|$|E

6000|$|... "She told <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{bought a}} certain little dog, {{it would lead}} to my being everlastingly--you know what. She isn't so squeamish as I am, and said it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would you}} could hear me," [...] she said,--"Father! I would {{you could hear}} <b>me</b> swear, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> now save what you most valued on earth, it is only to assist me in obtaining vengeance for your death." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{returned}} as number three batsman for the 1992–93 home Test {{series against the}} West Indies, but his form was again moderate. His 228 runs at 25.33 was bolstered by a score of 100 in the Third Test in Sydney. Waugh called this [...] "probably the most important hundred of my Test career ... word had reached <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't get runs, then I {{was going to be}} dropped". He continued to be a fixture in the ODI team, playing in all ten matches and scoring 213 runs at 23.66 with one half-century and taking nine wickets at 39.22.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I've sounded {{her sister}} as to THEIR dispositions, {{and she tells}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> present myself {{there will be no}} difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not like}} other girls, who can just leave {{themselves}} alone and {{be of no}} trouble. You told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> outlived you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|And as, perhaps, I {{seemed to}} wonder at {{this way of}} beginning, he opened a little, and said, [...] "It is my father. He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> came here I was to mind and do his work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are {{you getting}} on with your medical studies? Never forget, my boy, that your father's son has every claim upon <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can serve {{you in any way}} I am always at your command.--Ever affectionately yours, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was his fine, noble feeling. He {{thought it}} right to see <b>me</b> first, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> thought the {{decision}} too trying for Margaret, in her present state, or <b>if</b> <b>I</b> disapproved of the long engagement, I might spare her all knowledge of his coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think they}} have a sort of idea I'm slacking or something. At any rate, Walkinshaw told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> bucked up I might get tried again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dickory," [...] said she, [...] "you {{said that}} exactly as you spoke {{when you told}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> let myself drop into the darkness, you would be there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you promise}} me something?" [...] Sophy begged. [...] "Promise <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> stay in here quietly {{until after he}} has gone, you will come and tell me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Beetle, [...] "my leavin's between ourselves. The Head hasn't told any one. I know he hasn't, because Prout grunted at <b>me</b> to-day <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{were more}} reasonable--yah!--I {{might be a}} prefect next term. I s'ppose he's hard up for his prefects." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, Freydisa? Must I bear to be taunted by {{the woman}} I am to wed? Surely {{it would be better}} to die and have done. Let the ghost slay me if he will. It comes upon <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> so <b>I</b> shall be spared trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{for them}} in that house, an' I'll keep it up till I get to be reg'larly in the Department. They've done so much for <b>me,</b> Dan, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should spend half my time as long as I live blackin' their boots, I wouldn't square things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; had not he been so--so earnest about it. He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> married Sir Peregrine I {{should be}} doing a cruel injury to him--to his grandfather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go 'long!" [...] {{answered}} Billina, {{from the}} Scarecrow's shoulder. [...] "You promised <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> guessed correctly {{my friends and}} I might depart in safety. And you always keep your promises." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{what you}} really think of them?" [...] he begged. [...] "Count Sabatini has been so kind to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> try to think about him at all I am already prejudiced." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] {{the other}} went on, [...] "that Mr. Fortescue {{said that he}} had no {{personal}} objection to <b>me,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was in a position to}} give his daughter a home equal to that which I wanted her to leave, he would be content." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear that; but why did not you tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> before? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had known as much this morning I {{certainly}} would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is he,' said Mary, 'who {{receiving}} me in {{his house}} as his guest; his unwilling guest; knowing my history, and how defenceless and alone I am, presumes before his daughters to affront <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a brother but a child, who saw it, he would instinctively have helped me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look me {{straight}} in the face, Mr. Lynx, and tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> give you a handsome new tail, you will never boast about it or take undue pride in it,' said she.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she went}} {{straight}} to her room, and she told <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should see you, I was {{to say to you}} that you must come to her there at a quarter to seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you remember, I {{asked you}} a {{question}} before I went away? You refused to marry me then, but you told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> asked again when I came back, the answer might be different.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so. Dear Mrs. Roden, do {{not look}} at <b>me</b> like <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> do not say more to tell you {{immediately}} it is because I am not perhaps quite sure;--not sure, at any rate, of the reasons I may have to give. I will come to you to-morrow, and then I will tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He met {{it coming}} out of the town as he was {{entering}} early. [...] The men are travelling on foot, and rested there last night; and as it was Marion's birth-day, and he thought it would please her, he sent them on, with a pencilled note to <b>me,</b> saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> thought so too, they had come to serenade her.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} we struck that day was a {{procession}} of pilgrims. It was not going our way, but we joined it, nevertheless; for it was hourly being borne in upon <b>me</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would govern this country wisely, I must be posted {{in the details of}} its life, and not at second hand, but by personal observation and scrutiny.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. When I am {{on horseback}} I {{never think of}} danger. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> broke my bones I should not feel it. I should go at {{anything}} that came in my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Miss Barrington {{have taken}} such {{good care of}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{consulted}} my inclinations I would linger in convalescence a long while," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I must {{make an effort to}} get away to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's right comfortable, {{and shows}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't teach my boys {{anything}} else, I did {{give them the}} brotherly love that will make them stand by one another all their lives,' said Mrs Jo, when he had gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] he replied, [...] "you {{must not}} talk to <b>me</b> like <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{did not feel that}} my duty lay with Elizabeth, I should insist upon your coming to me, and under those {{conditions}} it would be I who should provide, not you. But for the moment I cannot leave your elder sister altogether. She needs me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. Never {{mind about}} being careful, then. Just answer <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question. Why, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not your {{interests}} sincerely at heart, should I have ticked you off, as stated?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've no fears,' said Ulick; 'I {{know very}} well what is the matter with <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't give way, it will go off in time. You've given it a good shove with your kindness, Mrs. Kendal,' he added, with deep emotion in his {{sensitive}} voice; 'only you must not talk of my going home, or you'll undo all you have done.' ...|$|R
