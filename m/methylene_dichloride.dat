To improve these estimates, some models have been developed using published exposure databases with their corresponding exposure determinants. These models are designed to be applied to reported exposure determinants obtained from study subjects or exposure levels assigned by an industrial hygienist, so quantitative exposure estimates can be obtained. ^ In an effort to improve the prediction accuracy and generalizability of these models, and taking into account that the limitations encountered in previous studies might be due to limitations in the applicability of traditional statistical methods and concepts, the use of computer science- derived data analysis methods, predominantly machine learning approaches, were proposed and explored in this study. ^ The goal of this study was to develop a set of models using decision trees/ensemble and neural networks methods to predict occupational outcomes based on literature-derived databases, and compare, using cross-validation and data splitting techniques, the resulting prediction capacity to that of traditional regression models. Two cases were addressed: the categorical case, where the exposure level was measured as an exposure rating following the American Industrial Hygiene Association guidelines and the continuous case, where the result of the exposure is expressed as a concentration value. Previously developed literature-based exposure databases for 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane, <b>methylene</b> <b>dichloride</b> and, trichloroethylene were used. ^ When compared to regression estimations, results showed better accuracy of decision trees/ensemble techniques for the categorical case while neural networks were better for estimation of continuous exposure values.

The compounds were reacted in <b>methylene</b> <b>dichloride</b> with either more 5, 7 -dicholoro- 8 -hydroxyquinolinol or picolinic acid. The kinetics of the ligand exchange reactions were followed using absorption data following changes in the spectra. Reaction rates and activation parameters were found for the three reactions studied. Studies of the reaction rate {{as a function of}} concentration show that the reactions are dissociative in nature. ^ The second part of this research involved the dissociation of europium(III) and yttrium(III) coordination compounds with salen and its derivatives in dimethyl sulfoxide. This reaction is followed by monitoring the decrease of europium(III) compound emission peaks and the growth of ligand emission as well as by absorption spectral changes. The reaction rates, activation energy, and reaction mechanism information were obtained for this exchange using the emission and absorption data. Several conclusions were made for this study of solvent insertion into the compound. Firstly, this reaction is not affected by light. Secondly, the solvent can affect the kinetics in that dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide are rate increasing solvents compared to water. Thirdly, the 2 to 3 compounds have generally a faster rate than the 1 to 2 compounds and the reactions. And fourthly, the compounds with a six-member chelating ring and an electron-withdrawing hydroxyl group are more kinetically stable than those with five member chelating rings. ^ The final part of this research involved the polymerization of Na[Ln(dshp) 2], where Ln = Y, Eu, with isophthalolyl chloride and terephthalolyl chloride. The resulting compounds were then analyzed and emission data measured for the europium species. However, the results did not support the formation of polymers. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{introduce}} binding sites into rigid membrane gaps, reactions were investigated to functionalise double- or triplebonds in aqueous media. Various oxidants (osmiumtetroxid, mercurydiacetate, tetrachloroauric(III) acid und rutheniumdioxide) led to secondary alcohols or ketones in 50 - 60 % yield. Tetrachloroauric(III) acid {{was found to}} be the best reagent under these reaction conditions. It was the only one which worked without addition of organic solvents, so it could be used for the purpose of oxidation within a rigid membrane which is localised in monolayers on solid substrates. Bolaamphiphiles with two central amide functions in addition to a terminal thiol function were synthesized in order to construct the membrane gaps. Other synthetic target molecules containing carbon-carbon double bonds were bipyridyl-amphiphiles containing alkene chains (oleyicacid chains, or derivates of dodecylmethacrylate). They should produce layered micelles with a fluid center and a redox-active head group. The center should dissolve photoactive porphyrins, the head groups work as electron acceptors or donors. The synthetised complexes showed however, that the increase of fluidity inside caused a destruction of the multilayered structure. Organised systems could not be obtained, although the new formed micelles dissolved a magnesia tetradecyloxyphenyl-porphyrin perfectly well. In the course of the investigation of fluid and solid micellar membrane structures dissolving the magnesia-porphyrin we observed strong effects of added solvents, in particular <b>methylene</b> <b>dichloride.</b> We observed a split soret band (exciton effect) indicating the formation of linear (no stacks) porphyrin assemblies. These aggregates were also found in presence of SDS micelles, which generally only provides space for porphyrin monomers. Ruthenium(II) the central metal ion of the complex head group of the bipyridyl-amphiphiles which formed rigid multilayered micelles upon sonification was then exchanged against iron(II). Although the iron complexes are kinetically much less stable compared to the ruthenium ones it was impossible to introduce the three different ligands one after the other analogous to the typical procedures for the synthesis of ruthenium complexes. Under this circumstances only symmetrical iron complexes trisubstituted with the ligand of highest binding constant towards iron(II) were obtained. Synthesis started therefore with bipyridinyl- 5 -carboxylate only. After reaction with one equivalent of an ethylendiamine derivate with two long alkylic chains we succeeded to obtain the desired unsymmetrically build trisbipyridyl-iron(II) -complex...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{approved}} anti-HIV {{drugs on}} the market only target the three HIV enzymes: reverse transcriptase, protease and more recently, integrase. Due to the limited nature of the current therapy, {{it is possible that}} a multi-drug resistant virus can emerge. The main concerns in developing countries however, are the expense and availability of the drugs and because of this, it is essential to investigate all alternatives. Traditional medicine offers many advantages as compared to allopathic treatment in so far as being relatively cheaper, accessible and it is broadly accepted in the population groups of the developing countries. Little is known though, of the exact efficacy and toxicity of these remedies so it is vital that these possible leads be investigated thoroughly. For the purpose of this study, two plants, Sutherlandia frutescens and Lobostemon trigonum were studied to ascertain their potential anti-HIV activity. Sutherlandia has received international attention as a possible cheap herbal remedy to improve the health of AIDS sufferers. Anecdotal evidence from health workers claim that HIV- infected patients on Sutherlandia treatment have shown improved CD 4 counts, decreased viral loads and a general improvement in well-being. Extracts were prepared from dried leaves and flowers in methanol, ethanol, acetone, <b>methylene</b> <b>dichloride</b> or distilled water. Sulphated polysaccharides have been described extensively in literature with regards to their anti-HIV activity, so as a form of dereplication; an ethanol precipitation was performed on the aqueous extracts to remove sulphated polysaccharides. A toxicity study was performed on all crude extracts using uninfected peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood. To measure anti-HIV activity, HIV-infected PBMCs were cultured with each of the crude extracts and cell viability measured using the tetrazolium salt, XTT. HIV-infected CEM-NKR-CCR 5 cells were also used and supernatant from the viral studies was tested for the HIV antigen p 24. xii Results varied greatly between assays but with the inclusion of a point-scale system to evaluate the extracts it was clear that overall the organic extracts of the Sutherlandia flowers, especially the acetone extract (SFA), showed great anti-HIV potential. SFA in every case decreased p 24 levels and in the toxicity study did not decrease cell proliferation. With the HIV-infected PBMCs SFA actually helped improve cell proliferation despite the infection. To determine the specific anti- HIV activity, all crude extracts were tested for inhibition of HIV-I reverse transcriptase, the glycohydrolase enzymes: a-glucosidase, ß-glucosidase, ßglucuronidase, HIV-I integrase and HIV-II protease. No significant inhibition was seen with these experiments except for the HIV-I RT assay. The aqueous extract of the Lobostemon leaves produced an inhibitor of HIV-RT with a very low IC 50 value of 0. 049 mg/ml. Some inhibitory effect was lost with the removal of the sulphated polysaccharides and the addition of BSA to the assay, but still 64 % inhibition of the HIVRT remained, which confirmed that the inhibitor could be something novel, and not of the polysaccharide or tannin compounds...|$|E
40|$|Die Kobalt-katalysierte gekreuzte [4 + 2]-Benzanellierung von C 4 -substituierten 1, 3 -Eninen 29 / 41 mit disubstituierten Buta- 1, 3 -diinen 38 konnte,unter Verwendung des HILT-Katalysators, bestehend aus dem PräkatalysatorCoBr 2 (dppp), dem Reduktionsmittel Zinkpulver, der LEWIS-Säure Zinkiodid und dem ösungsmittel Dichlormethan, realisiert werden. Zunächst wurden die Umsetzungen von C 4 -substituierten 1, 3 -Eninen 29 a-h/ 41 mit den symmetrischen Buta- 1, 3 -diinen 38 a-d untersucht. Als Produkte wurden die 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituierten Benzolderivate 106 a-l erhalten. Dabei verlief die Reaktion unter vollständiger Kontrolle der Regioselektivität und es wurde ausschließlich das Produkt mit der Alkin-Funktion in der C 2 -Position als einziges Regioisomer erhalten. Die Reaktionen tolerierten eine Vielzahl an funktionellen Gruppen und die Produkte 106 a-l konnten in akzeptablen bis guten Ausbeuten erhalten werden. Des Weiteren wurde die gekreuzte [4 + 2]-Benzanellierung zwischen dem Phenyl-substituierten 1, 3 -Enin 41 und verschiedenen unsymmetrisch substituierten Buta- 1, 3 -diinen 38 j-p unter Verwendung des Kobalt-Katalysatorsystem untersucht. In den Reaktionen konnten die beiden regioisomeren 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituierten Benzolderivate 117 und 118 in akzeptablen bis guten Ausbeuten und guten bis sehr guten Regioselektivitäten erhalten werden. Als Hauptprodukte wurden die 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituierten Benzolderivate 117, mit dem sterisch weniger anspruchsvollen Substituenten (R=Alkyl, Aryl) am anellierten Ring und dem sterisch anspruchsvollerem Substituenten am Alkin (TMS), bevorzugt gebildet. Der direkte Vergleich dieser Ergebnisse mit denen der literaturbekannten, komplementären Palladium-katalysierten gekreuzten [4 + 2]-Benzanelierung nach YAMAMOTO und GEVORGYAN zeigte, dass unter Palladium-Katalyse genau die gegensätzlichen 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituierten Benzolderivate 118 als Hauptisomere, mit dem sterisch anspruchsvolleren Rest (TMS) am anellierten Ring und dem sterisch weniger anspruchsvollen Rest (R=Alkyl, Aryl) am Alkin, bevorzugt erhalten wurden. Durch die Verwendung des Kobalt-Katalysatorsystems war es demzufolge erstmals möglich die 1, 2, 3 - trisubstituierten Benzolderivate 117 als Hauptprodukte in der gekreuzten [4 + 2]-Benzanellierung zu erhalten und somit die Substratbreite der Reaktion um ein weiteres, durch andere Methoden nur schwer zugängliches Benzolderivat, zu erweitern. The cobalt-catalyzed crossed [4 + 2]-benzanullation of C 4 -substituted 1, 3 -enynes 29 / 41 with disubstituted buta- 1, 3 -diynes 38 was {{realized}} {{by the use}} of the HILTcatalyst consisting of the pre-catalyst CoBr 2 (dppp), the reducing agent zinc powder, the LEWIS acid zinciodide and <b>methylene</b> <b>dichloride</b> as solvent. First, reactions between C 4 -substituted 1, 3 -enynes 29 a-h/ 41 and symmetrical buta- 1, 3 -diynes 38 a-f were investigated resulting in 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted benzene derivatives 106 a-l as product. The reactions proceeded in absolute control of regioselectivity and products with the alkyne functionality in C 2 -position were formed exclusively. The present reaction tolerated a wide range of functional groups, affording the 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted benzenes 106 a-l in acceptable to good yields. Moreover, the crossed [4 + 2]-benzannulation of the phenyl-substituted 1, 3 -enyne 41 and various unsymmetrical substituted buta- 1, 3 -diynes 38 j-p was investigated using the cobalt-catalyst system. The reactions resulted in the formation of two regioisomeric 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted benzene derivatives 117 and 118 in acceptable to good yields and good to very good regioselectivities. As major products the 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted benzene derivatives 117 were obtained, with the sterically less hindered substituent (R=alkyl, aryl) at the annulated benzene ring and the sterically more hindered substituent (TMS) at the alkyne moiety. The comparison of these results with those of the literature known and complementary palladium(II) - catalyzed crossed [4 + 2]-benzannulation of YAMAMOTO and GEVORGYAN showed, that under palladium- catalysis the opposite regioisomeric 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted benzene derivatives 118 were formed predominantly, with the sterically more hindered substituent (TMS) at the annulated benzene ring and the sterically less hindered substituent (R=alkyl, aryl) at the alkyne moiety. Consequently, the use of the cobalt-catalyzed system resulted in the unprecedented synthesis of 1, 2, 3 - trisubstituted benzenes of type 117 as major product in the crossed [4 + 2]-benzannulation, which broadened the scope of this reaction leading to a new type of products not easily accessible by other methods...|$|E
