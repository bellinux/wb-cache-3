5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> are {{recognized}} as an important approach to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity {{as well as to}} manage costal and marine resource. This thesis addresses the development and management of <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Australia and in China. Australia and China are major maritime countries with diverse marine creatures and ecosystems. Both countries have adopted <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> as a management tool to <b>protect</b> the <b>marine</b> environment. This thesis introduces their marine environment and threats, and then makes a close study of the development, legislation and management of <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in both Australia and China. Two case studies, Jervis Bay Marine Park in Australia, and Shankou Mangrove Marine Nature Reserve in China provide examples of the management strategies and lessons learnt. In order to improve the management of <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in China, the thesis analyzes the conflicts in the development of <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in China and prescribes community participation and the marine special reserve as solutions to promote the development of <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> This study also examines how the Australian Defence Force, an important stakeholder, manages its activities in the <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, federal {{organizations}} {{developed the}} Federal <b>Marine</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas</b> Strategy. This strategy is a collaborative approach implemented by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Parks Canada, and Environment Canada {{to plan and}} manage federal <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The federal <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> work with Aboriginal groups, industries, academia, environmental groups, and NGOs to strengthen <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The federal <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> network consists of three core programs: <b>Marine</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas,</b> <b>Marine</b> Wildlife Areas, and National Marine Conservation Areas. The MPA is a program to be noted because it is significant in protecting ecosystems {{from the effects of}} industrial activities. The MPA guiding principles are Integrated Management, ecosystem-based management approach, Adaptive Management Approach, Precautionary Principle, and Flexible Management Approach. All five guiding principles are used collectively and simultaneously to collaborate and respect legislative mandates of individual departments, to use scientific knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to manage human activities, to monitor and report on programs to meet conservation objectives of MPAs, to use best available information in the absence of scientific certainty, and to maintain a balance between conservation needs and sustainable development objectives.|$|R

25|$|Table Mountain National Park, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Cape Peninsula National Park, was proclaimed on 29 May 1998, {{for the purpose of}} protecting the natural environment of the Table Mountain Chain, and in particular the rare fynbos vegetation.

The coastal waters surrounding the Cape Peninsula are proclaimed as a <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> since 2004, and include several no-take zones, and are part of the national park. The waters of this <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> are unusual in that they are parts of two fairly distinct marine bioregions, namely the Agulhas Bioregion and the South-western Cape Bioregion.

40|$|Recently {{there have}} been a {{considerable}} number of calls for high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> to be established. The aim of establishing these <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is for the protection of deep sea features {{as well as for the}} implementation of an ecosystem approach combined with the precautionary principle. This thesis aims to consider the legal issues involved in this action and looks in particular at whether it is legally possible to create the newly required high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> which would be effective. The first task of this thesis is to confirm the calls for the newly required high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> and to consequently ask how they differ from the traditional <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> This thesis then examines how the relevant international treaties and organizations have provided a legal basis for the new type of high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> to be collectively established by the involvement of multiple States so as to effectively safeguard the targeted deep sea ecosystems. The next question which is answered by this thesis is whether or not the new type of high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> can overcome the third States issue and so would be more effective than traditional area closures. This thesis concludes that the new type of high seas <b>marine</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is not far enough advanced in a way which would mean that it can be held as binding on third States. However, it can be more advanced in that its incorporation of the ecosystem approach promotes knowledge of deep sea conservation among international organizations and has influenced peer institutions to swiftly react to the new requirement to conserve vulnerable deep sea features...|$|R
