The Government also claimed that it had been necessary to ban the event for the protection of morals, referring prominent religious organisations' opposition to the march, and that, as there was no consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality within society, national authorities were better placed than the European Court to determine the conditions for such events.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how legal choices, and in {{particular}} legislative determinations, need to consider multiple rights and values, and can be assessed accordingly. First {{it is argued that}} legal norms (and {{in particular}} constitutional rightnorms) often prescribe the pursuit of goals, which may be in conflict one with another. Then a model of teleological reasoning is brought to bear on choices affecting different goals, among which those prescribed by constitutional norms. An analytical framework is provided for evaluating such choices with regard to possible alternatives. The assessment of legislative choices according to proportionality is then considered, and is modelled using the provided analytical framework. Finally, the framework is expanded to include the ideas of reasonableness and institutional deference, and the corresponding <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>appreciation...</b>|$|R

500|$|A foetus, {{even at a}} late {{stage of}} pregnancy, is not {{protected}} by the law of homicide (rather, other offences have been created to prevent the proscribed harm). To qualify, the victim must have an [...] "independent existence". This was confirmed in 1998 in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1994), even where the foetus is viable and could have survived if born before the offence was committed. The confused rationale appears to match the complicated moral and biological distinction on which it is based; there is huge social significance placed upon birth and thus the law is unlikely to change [...] Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights {{has not yet been}} interpreted to conflict with the English law. Instead, in Vo v France, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that most definitions were within the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> set aside to national law.

40|$|Debates about non-state {{normative}} communities often devolve into {{clashes between}} two polarized positions. On the one hand, {{we see the}} desire to eradicate difference through forced obeisance to a single overarching state norm. On the other, we see claims of complete autonomy for non-state lawmaking, as if such non-state communities could plausibly exist in isolation from the communities that both surround and intersect them. Neither of these positions takes seriously the importance of engagement and dialogue across difference. Navigating difference doesn’t require either assimilation or separation; it requires negotiation. Legal pluralists have long charted this process of negotiation, noting, for example, that colonial legal systems did not eradicate indigenous systems (even when they tried to). Instead, there was a layering and intermingling of systems. And, just as important, actors strategically used the variety of fora to gain leverage and make their voices heard. But legal pluralists have usually stopped at the descriptive. Thus, while they have catalogued the myriad ways in which state and non-state lawmaking interact, they have not taken the next step and attempted to articulate the normative jurisprudence that might flow from these observations. After all, {{it is one thing}} to say that as a descriptive matter interactions among legal and quasi-legal systems operating in the same social field inevitably occur; it is quite another to argue (as I attempt to do here) that such messy interactivity is actually a potentially desirable feature to build into legal and political systems. I call this messy interactivity a jurisprudence of hybridity, and I argue that such a jurisprudence may actually be preferable to either a hierarchical jurisprudence whereby the hegemonic state imposes a universal norm, or a separatist jurisprudence whereby non-state communities attempt to maintain complete autonomy. First, such a jurisprudence acknowledges the reality that people hold multiple community affiliations, rather than dissolving that multiplicity into either universality or separatism. Second, developing procedural mechanisms, institutions, or discursive practices that acknowledge hybridity helps to ensure that multiple communities are at least taken seriously and given a voice. Third, providing space for multiple communities may result in better substantive decisions because there is more space for variations and experimentation. In this Essay, I start by referencing work of sociologists and political theorists analyzing interpersonal and societal communication, and I contrast a vision whereby difference is overcome by assuming commonality with one in which “otherness” is seen as an inevitable part of human interaction. I then turn to law and survey three different procedural mechanisms that are or could be examples of a jurisprudence of hybridity with regard to non-state communities. First, I examine the idea <b>of</b> building <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> into constitutional jurisprudence to allow some scope for local and non-state community variation. Second, I explore the possibility that limited autonomy or participation regimes can help ensure some scope for non-state norms. And third, I suggest that thinking of non-state norms through the prism of conflict of laws doctrines — jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of judgments — might be preferable to the more mechanistic ways in which clashes between state and nonstate norms are often judged...|$|R

Amendments rejected included giving courts a greater degree of flexibility with regard to Strasbourg case-law and referring to the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> accorded to states by the Court, as well as limiting the obligation to interpret legislation compatibly with Convention rights only when it was 'reasonable' to do so.

2500|$|In JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham, Mr and Mrs Graham {{had been}} let {{a part of}} Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, {{on the basis that}} this might disturb getting {{planning}} permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under ECHR Protocol 1, article 1 to [...] "peaceful enjoyment of possessions". The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> to determine the relevant property rules. Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired. However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to prevent adverse possession.|$|E

In the final section we consider the affective and cognitive components <b>of</b> <b>appreciation,</b> arguing that mixed-affective responses (rather than bi-polar conceptualizations of affective valence) better capture the experience <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> and its accompanying feelings states such as inspiration, awe, and tenderness. ...|$|R
