50|$|Pulse shaping is {{to modify}} the pulses from the source in a {{well-defined}} manner, including manipulation on pulse’s amplitude, phase and duration.To amplify pulse’s intensity, chirped pulse amplification is generally applied, which includes a pulse stretcher, amplifier and compressor. It will not change the duration or phase of the pulse during the amplification. Pulse compression (shorten the pulse duration) is achieved by first chirping the pulse in a nonlinear material and broadening the spectrum, with a following compressor for chirp compensation. Fiber compressor is generally used in this case.Pulse shapers usually refer to optical <b>modulators</b> which applies Fourier transforms to laser beam.

40|$|Abstract: High-speed and {{high-performance}} optical {{phase and}} amplitude <b>modulators</b> are critical components of many photonic systems. Semiconductor-based <b>modulators</b> are very attractive, since {{they can be}} monolithically integrated with other semiconductor devices. Unfortunately, the commonly used <b>modulators</b> based on square quantum wells have inherent properties that limit their modulation performance. We present {{a new class of}} quantum wells called “stepped quantum wells ” (SQW) with extra degrees of freedom {{that can be used to}} design high performance optical <b>modulators.</b> We demonstrated SQW phase <b>modulators</b> with nearly one order of magnitude higher efficiency than their counterparts. Also, linearized <b>modulators</b> based on SQW with more than two orders of magnitude higher linearity than the existing semiconductor <b>modulators</b> are presented. Finally, high-performance surface-normal <b>modulators</b> based on SQWs with nearly two times better efficiency and 7 dB higher extinction ratio compared with the conventional devices with rectangular and coupled-quantum well active layers are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Electro-optic {{amplitude}} and phase <b>modulators</b> {{allow you}} to control the amplitude, phase, and polarization state of an optical beam electrically. For instance, in communications systems, these <b>modulators</b> impress information onto an optical frequency carrier. Unlike direct modulation of the laser itself, external <b>modulators</b> do not cause any degrading effects on laser linewidth and stability. In measurement systems, amplitude <b>modulators</b> {{can be used as}} actuators to hold the intensity in a laser beam constant, or as optical choppers to produce a pulse stream from a CW laser beam. Phase <b>modulators</b> are used to stabilize the frequency of a laser beam, or to mode-lock a laser. There are basically two types of modulators: bulk and integrated-optic. Bulk <b>modulators</b> are made out of discrete pieces of nonlinear optical crystals and are typically used on a lab bench or an optical table. They feature very low insertion losses, and high power-handling capability. Integrated-optic <b>modulators,</b> because they use waveguide technology to lower the required drive voltages, are wavelength specific.

5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate <b>modulator</b> that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E
5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF <b>modulator</b> and was {{designed}} for use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF <b>modulator.</b> It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
