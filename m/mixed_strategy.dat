25|$|A second interpretation, that Nash {{referred}} to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: ``t is unnecessary {{to assume that the}} participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes.

25|$|Games such as {{the game}} of chicken and hawk-dove game in which players score highest when they choose {{opposite}} strategies, i.e., discoordinate, are called anti-coordination games. They have reaction correspondences (Figure 4) that cross {{in the opposite direction}} to coordination games, with three Nash equilibria, one in each of the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a <b>mixed</b> <b>strategy</b> which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line.

One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ``Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium, Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's <b>mixed</b> <b>strategy</b> as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to justify the use of {{constant}} <b>mix</b> investment <b>strategies</b> as an approximation for periodically rebalanced investment strategies. In Dhaene et al. (2005), general optimization problems are solved in a lognormal framework by deriving convex order bounds based on comonotonicity. The multi-period optimal portfolio selection problems discussed in Dhaene et al. (2005) are solved working in the class of constant <b>mix</b> <b>strategies.</b> As this class requires the investment portfolio to be rebalanced on a continuous basis, it can not be applied in practice. However, constant <b>mix</b> <b>strategies</b> have clear computational advantages compared to the more realistic class of periodically rebalanced strategies. Therefore it is important to investigate the appropriateness of these constant <b>mix</b> <b>strategies,</b> which is the main goal of this paper. Our numerical results confirm that, within our lognormal framework, continuous rebalancing can be seen as a limiting case of periodic rebalancing. Moreover, we see that results obtained by periodically rebalancing the available assets are very close to those obtained through continuously rebalancing them, which justifies the use of constant <b>mix</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{environment}} of Jordanian private hospitals {{has never been}} so complex and challenging as at present. There are huge influences on these hospitals in the current climate. Managers in these hospitals are finding themselves, more than ever before, confronted by increasing pressures and demands which they must seek to understand and respond to in their service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> {{in order to achieve}} effective strategic marketing in terms of their choice of service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> components (namely health service, pricing, distribution, promotion, physical evidence, process, and personal strategies). This research, therefore, investigates the influence competitive environment factors have on the service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> components made by Jordanian private hospital managers, and on the reality of the Jordanian private hospital marketing. The literature review reveals that there is an extensive body of research that addresses service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> in general but there is less emphasis on the health sector. Moreover, evidence of the impact of a competitive environment on service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> and hospital performance measurements' criteria in the hospital industry is limited. In order to explore this issue, a triangulation method was used to collect primary data through a questionnaire, which was administered in the private sector hospitals in the six Jordanian governorates and, via in-depth semi structured interviews with hospital managers and experts in the health services in Jordan. All Jordanian general private sector hospitals were targeted in this research rather than a representative sample of these hospitals. A purposive sampling strategy was used to choose the participants in this research. In total, - 143 senior managers (general manager, administrative manager, medical manager, public relation manager, marketing manager, and out patients clinic manager) participated in this study. The results confirm significant differences in the influence of competitive environment factors on service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> components. They also reveal that the components of the marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> have varied significant and insignificant influence on the hospital performance, which demonstrates that the hospital performance phenomenon is complicated and multi-dimensional in nature. Furthermore, the results exhibit that hospital managers might benefit more by placing more emphasis on an integrated service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> and recognising the competitive environment influences on their hospitals. The results also highlight several implications for future research in health services marketing and fills in several gaps in the existing literature on health services marketing. This research contributes to the academic and practical knowledge as being one of the first attempts to investigate empirically the impact of the competitive environment on service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy.</b> As such, the influences of service marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> on hospitals' performance criteria, identifying the main concerns and problems which face the management and marketing in Jordanian private sector hospitals, are explored in addition to recognising the vital roles of marketing in improving the hospital performance. This research integrates, refines and extends the empirical work conducted in the field of health services marketing in developing countries. It raises many implications for managers in these hospitals, such as considering the importance of influences by competitive environment on marketing <b>mix</b> <b>strategy</b> and the vital role this strategy plays in the performance of Jordanian private sector hospitals. This research provides useful guidelines for further and future research possibilities such as exploring the influence of the competitive environment factors influence on hospital performance criteria.
