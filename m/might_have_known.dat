5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor's grandchildren, Julia the Younger and Agrippa Postumus (the latter {{adopted by}} him), were also banished {{around the same}} time. Julia's husband, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, was put to death for {{conspiracy}} against Augustus, a conspiracy Ovid <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the troops}} types, {{it is unknown}} {{whether or not the}} Persian {{infantry}} engaged in the battle. It is most likely Cyrus and the cavalry he had escaped with from Media fought directly with the Median cavalry Astyages had sent to bring Cyrus back. Cyrus <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> he needed all his men when fighting Astyages's best cavalry, for when battle had started, Cyrus with his will and superior numbers had the advantage. Nicolas goes as far as to say Cyrus first displayed his bravery in this battle. Nevertheless, Cyrus's tactics proved successful in maintaining the war. In Herodotus' Histories, he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus goes over to Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media. This seems to go in accordance with Nicolaus' account of the first battle.|$|E

500|$|In health class, {{the whole}} class starts taking care of fake babies. Vice Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels) calls Veronica {{into his office and}} gives her {{detention}} for having keys to his file cabinet. Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{according}} to Lei's findings, on 13 October, British ambassador Claude MacDonald reported to his government about the Chinese situation, saying that Chinese reforms had {{been damaged by}} Kang Youwei and his friends’ actions. British diplomat Frederick Bourne claimed in his own report that Kang was a dreamer who had been seduced by Timothy Richard's sweet words. Bourne thought Richard was a plotter. The British and U.S. governments were unaware of the [...] "federation" [...] plot, {{which seems to have}} been Richard's personal idea. Because Richard's partner Itō Hirobumi had been Prime Minister of Japan, the Japanese government <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about Richard's plan, but {{there is no evidence to}} this effect.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 11 press conference, Obama {{stated that}} he, {{his staff and}} his {{transition}} team {{were not involved in}} any corrupt activity, and that his staff had been exonerated by the 76-page FBI affidavit. He stated that, not only had he never engaged the governor on the topic of his Senate seat, but he was [...] "confident that no representative of mine would have any part in any deals related to this seat". His administration compiled a summary of who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what at various times. Obama stated that he did not think Blagojevich could [...] "effectively serve the people of Illinois" [...] and that his former Senate seat [...] "belongs to the people". He also stated that to his knowledge, no representatives of his had engaged in any dealmaking with the governor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, Dr. Charles Eastman, a Dakota Sioux physician, {{was hired}} by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to locate Sacagawea's remains. Eastman visited many {{different}} Native American tribes, to interview elderly individuals who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> or heard of Sacagawea, and learned of a Shoshone woman at the Wind River Reservation with the Comanche name Porivo (chief woman). [...] Some of the people he interviewed said that she spoke of a long journey wherein she had helped white men, and that she had a silver Jefferson peace medal of the type carried by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He found a Comanche woman called Tacutine who said that Porivo was her grandmother. She had married into a Comanche tribe and had a number of children, including Tacutine's father Ticannaf. Porivo left the tribe after her husband Jerk-Meat was killed.|$|E
2500|$|O'Kelly was at {{the heart}} of the party operation. [...] He was one of a handful of men who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of the [...] "All-Ireland" [...] Volunteer HQ at Athenry, County Galway, {{according}} to Liam O'Briain involved in marshalling the rebellion in the western hills from Limerick across the Shannon. [...] He was also responsible for springing Bulmer Hobson from the custody of the IRB. [...] Thereafter Hobson mysterious [...] "disappearance" [...] became the moment when [...] "a devoted son" [...] of Ireland was excluded from the movement; but O'Kelly may have saved his life. During the Rising he was in and out of the GPO, and was requested to set up as [...] "Civil Administrator of the Government of the Republic" [...] with four others. [...] The project never proceeded, as perhaps no attempt was made to anticipate preparations for a political structure free from Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "lost evidence" [...] in {{question}} was a photograph found in the National Archives at College Park of Jaluit Atoll in the South Pacific Mandate, the Japanese mandate for the Marshall Islands. [...] The photograph includes two European-looking people. [...] The documentary, through a forensic analyst who specialized in facial recognition, posited that it was [...] "very likely" [...] to be {{a picture of a}} captured Earhart and Noonan. [...] The Lost Evidence also says that a barge in the background might possibly contain a plane, and that plane might possibly have been the Electra. [...] The photograph was from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and prepared for the 1944 invasion of the Marshall Islands during World War II. [...] The documentary suggested that a ship seen in the background flying a Japanese flag might be the Kōshū Maru, a Japanese military naval vessel, that would have been involved in transporting the captives. [...] It suggests that perhaps the Kōshū Maru transported them to Saipan, where they died in custody. [...] The documentary also cited existing evidence for the Japanese capture hypothesis, such as locals who claimed to have witnessed a plane crash at Mili Atoll. [...] It also suggested that the US government <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about the capture and covered this knowledge up.|$|E
