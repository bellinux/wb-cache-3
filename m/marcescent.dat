By the same token, palms with <b>marcescent</b> leaf bases are also more susceptible to epiphytic parasites like figs that may completely engulf and strangle the palms.|$|E
50|$|Marcescence is the {{retention}} of dead plant organs that normally are shed. It is most obvious in deciduous trees that retain leaves through the winter. Several trees normally have <b>marcescent</b> leaves such as oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and hornbeam (Carpinus), or <b>marcescent</b> stipules as in some but not all species of willows (Salix). <b>Marcescent</b> leaves of pin oak (Quercus palustris) complete development of their abscission layer in the spring. The base of the petiole remains alive over the winter. Many other trees may have <b>marcescent</b> leaves in seasons where an early freeze kills the leaves before the abscission layer develops or completes development. Diseases or pests can also kill leaves before they can develop an abscission layer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marcescent</b> leaves may protect {{some species}} from water stress or {{temperature}} stress. For example, in tropical alpine environments {{a wide variety}} of plants in different plant families and {{different parts of the world}} have evolved a growth form known as the caulescent rosette, characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above <b>marcescent</b> leaves. Examples of plants for which the <b>marcescent</b> leaves have been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are Espeletia schultzii and Espeletia timotensis, both from the Andes.|$|E
40|$|Using a fast mixing a {{irradiation}} technique, the {{gas explosion}} method, with Serratia <b>marcescents,</b> {{the decay of}} oxygen-dependent damage is found to consist of a fast and a slow stage, {{each of which is}} associated with a sub-component of this damage. In the present work, the interactions of these components with radiosensitizers are examined. At low concentrations O 2, TAN (a nitroxyl) and misonidazole all preferentially sensitize the slow-stage damage. At higher concentrations, O 2 and TAN sensitize the fast-stage damage by a fixation reaction that competes with its repair; in contrast, misonidazole appears mainly to operate by reaction with an earlier, ever shorter form of oxygen-dependent damage...|$|R

50|$|Many palms form a skirt-like or shuttlecock-like {{crown of}} <b>marcescent</b> leaves under new growth that may persist {{for years before}} being shed. In some species only juveniles retain dead leaves and marcescence in palms is {{considered}} a primitive trait.|$|E
50|$|The plants live at high {{altitude}} in páramo ecosystems. The trunk is thick, with succulent hairy leaves disposed in a dense spiral pattern. <b>Marcescent</b> leaves help protect the plants from cold. The flowers are usually yellow, similar to daisies.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{advantage of}} <b>marcescent</b> leaves {{is that they}} may deter feeding of large herbivores, such as deer and moose, which normally eat the twigs and their nutritious buds. Dead, dry leaves make the twigs less nutritious and less palatable.|$|E
50|$|Leaves have short {{petioles}} and {{are deeply}} and irregularly lobed, with {{four to eight}} pairs of lobes per leaf. There are stellate hairs {{on both sides of}} the leaf. Leaves are <b>marcescent,</b> turning brown but remaining on the tree all winter until new leaves emerge in the spring.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>marcescent</b> is {{also used}} in {{mycology}} to describe a mushroom which (unlike most species, described as [...] "putrescent") can dry out, but later revive and continue to disperse spores. Genus Marasmius {{is well known for}} this feature, which was considered taxonomically important by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1838 classification of the fungi.|$|E
50|$|Dypsis is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} Arecaceae family. They are slender, evergreen palms with yellow flowers carried in panicles amongst the pinnate leaves. Many Dypsis species have aerial branching (above the main trunk), a rare growth habit among palms. Some have <b>marcescent</b> leaves that remain attached after death and trap litter for nutrients.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} a low, {{spreading}} shrub growing up to 15 cm tall. The leaves are 2 to 6 cm long and <b>marcescent,</b> {{remaining on the}} shrub as they die. The inflorescence is a hairy, glandular raceme of up to 6 flowers, each about half a centimeter long. The fruit is a drupe. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting from stolons and underground rhizomes.|$|E
5000|$|Nenga is a {{monoecious}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plant in the}} palm endemic to Southeast Asia, commonly called pinang palm. N. gajah is the aberration in the genus with its short internodes, <b>marcescent</b> leaves and interfoliar inflorescence, a combination of traits seen in a few species of the closely related Pinanga and Areca palms. [...] The genus name {{is based on a}} corruption of a Javanese term for a plant now classified within Pinanga.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of {{protection}} {{is provided by}} the caulescent rosette {{which is part of the}} growth form of the giant Espeletia genus in South America, which has a well-developed stem above the ground. In tropical alpine environments a wide variety of plants in different plant families and different parts of the world have evolved this growth form characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above <b>marcescent</b> leaves. Examples where this arrangement has been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are Espeletia schultzii and Espeletia timotensis, both from the Andes.|$|E
50|$|Phoenix theophrasti {{grows up}} to 15 m tall, usually with several slender stems. The leaves are pinnate, 2-3 m long, with {{numerous}} rigid greyish-green linear leaflets 15-50 cm long {{on each side}} of the central rachis. Dead leaves are <b>marcescent,</b> remaining attached to the stem for years after withering. The fruit is an oval yellowish-brown drupe 1.5 cm long and 1 cm diameter and containing a single large seed; the fruit pulp is too thin and fibrous to be of agricultural significance and has an acrid taste, though the fruits are sometimes eaten by the locals.|$|E
50|$|The {{converse}} of deciduous is evergreen, where foliage is shed on {{a different}} schedule from deciduous trees, therefore appearing to remain green year round. Plants that are intermediate may be called semi-deciduous; they lose old foliage as new growth begins. Other plants are semi-evergreen and lose their leaves before the next growing season, retaining some during winter or dry periods. Some trees, including a few species of oak, have desiccated leaves that remain on the tree through winter; these dry persistent leaves are called <b>marcescent</b> leaves and are dropped in the spring as new growth begins.|$|E
5000|$|Lobelia telekii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the bellflower family, Campanulaceae, that is found only in the alpine zones of Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon, and the Aberdare Mountains of East Africa. It lives at high altitudes on well-drained sloped hillsides. It is a semelparous species, putting all its reproductive effort into producing single large inflorescence up to 3 m tall, and then dying.L. telekii also possesses a large pith-volume for internal water storage and <b>marcescent</b> foliage which could provide insulation. It secretes a polysaccharide, which may be useful for its survival in the cold climate. [...] The plant is named after the Austro-Hungarian explorer, Count Sámuel Teleki.|$|E
5000|$|The {{author of}} the genus was Elias Magnus Fries, who in 1838 {{classified}} white-spored agarics having a tough central stipe in this taxon if they were <b>marcescent,</b> i.e. they could dry out, but later revive when moistened. For Fries, marcescence (by contrast with the [...] "" [...] (decomposing) nature of most mushrooms) was an important character for classification, which he used to separate this group from genus Collybia (which has now been split into many newer genera). The name Marasmius itself comes from a Greek word marasmos, meaning [...] "drying out". Modern mycologists no longer consider the marcescence/putrescence distinction a reliable criterion for taxonomy, but Fries's definition of the genus is still roughly applicable.|$|E
50|$|Beccariophoenix alfredii {{grows up}} to 50 ft in height with a trunk up to 1 ft in diameter. The trunk is unarmed and bare, with closely ringed leaf scars. The crown holds 30-36 pinnate leaves, which reach lengths of 4.5 m. Each leaf holds {{approximately}} 120 pairs of leaflets. The leaflets are very slender and crowded at the base, and are either rigid or somewhat pendulous. Towards {{the base of}} the leaf, leaflets are about 47 cm long and 1 cm wide. Mid leaf, leaflets are at their largest, being about 112 cm long and 4 cm wide. At the tip of the leaf, leaflets become smaller again, being 65 cm long and 1.8 cm wide. Dead leaves are <b>marcescent</b> in juvenile palms, but abscise neatly in adults.|$|E
50|$|Oaks have spirally {{arranged}} leaves, with lobate margins in many species; {{some have}} serrated leaves or entire leaf with smooth margins. Also, the acorns contain tannic acid, {{as do the}} leaves, which helps to guard from fungi and insects. Many deciduous species are <b>marcescent,</b> not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers. The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6-18 months to mature, depending on their species. The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.|$|E
5000|$|Luzula nivalis is a {{relatively}} small perennial herbaceous plant (or [...] "herb") which grows to heights of between 2.5 - 25 cm in a caespitose fashion. L. nivalis has fibrous roots and ascending rhizomes, older plants have vertical stems either at ground level or underground; the plant base is straw-brown/pale castaneous brown in colour. The plant is subglabrous with erect, aerial stems and numerous alternate basal leaves. These crowded leaves are <b>marcescent,</b> flat, remain for many years, usually up to 5 cm long and 3 - 4 mm wide. L. nivalis also has 1-2 cauline leaves which are 1 - 2 cm long; both leaf types are grass-like, flat, linear, straight and possess parallel veins. The leaf tips are obtuse, acuminate, involute, caducous and slightly swollen. Both the blade adaxial and abaxial surfaces are glabrous, with sparse, white, non-glandular hairs along the blade margins.|$|E
50|$|Ranunculus allenii {{grows to}} about 9 to 20 cm in length, {{and is a}} {{perennial}} herb that is caespitose (grows in dense clumps). The roots are filiform (very thin in diameter), approximately 0.2 to 0.8 mm thick. Ranunculus allenii grows from a caudex (a thick short stem at ground level), with trichomes that either lay flat or spread out. Its basal leaves are mostly reniform (kidney shaped) and <b>marcescent,</b> while the cauline leaves (leaves of the stem) are linear and are positioned alternately. The petioles connecting the leaf blade to the stem are about 50 to 80 mm long. Leaf blades are flat, about 14 to 21 mm in length and 17 to 28 mm in width, and have a smooth surface on top but are pubescent beneath. The leaf veins are palmate, meaning several veins arise from a single point near the petiole attachment. The flowers can be either solitary or in an inflorescence of 2 to 4 medium-sized flowers. Each flower has 5 sepals that are about 2 to 3 mm long and 4 to 6 mm wide, the calyx is covered with small, white or translucent hairs, and has 5 yellow, obovate, petals that are about 4 to 5 mm long and 2 to 4 mm wide. Each flower has about 20-30 stamens with filaments that are smooth. Further, it has ovate nectaries, a hairy receptacle that is 3 to 5 mm long, about 60 to 80 apocarpous (free) carpels. There is only one ovule and stigma per ovary, the styles are straight, and the fruit stalk, 4 to 7 mm long, is dry.|$|E
40|$|The present work proposes new {{boundaries}} for {{the current}} submediterranean territories of the Iberian Peninsula, defining them at the smallest scale attempted to date. The boundaries proposed are not sharp divisions but somewhat ‘gradual’, reflecting the transitional nature of the territories they encompass. Climate change predictions were used to estimate how the distribution of these submediterranean regions might change in the near future. The maps constructed {{are based on the}} distribution of <b>marcescent</b> Quercus species—trees that characterise the submediterranean plant landscape where they form the main forest communities. To determine their climatic range, the distribution of different types of Iberian oak forest was represented in ‘climate diagrams’ (ordination diagrams derived from principal components analysis), both in terms of individual species and groups of species based on leaf ecophysiological type, i. e. <b>marcescent</b> (Submediterranean), sclerophyllous (Mediterranean), semideciduous (Mediterranean) and deciduous (Eurosiberian). The climate range of each type of forest was determined, and the means of representative climate variables are analysed by one way ANOVA. The variables differentiating the forest groups were also examined by discriminant analysis. The range of the climate variables found {{to be associated with the}} majority of <b>marcescent</b> forests was used to determine the distribution of territories throughout the Peninsula with the same conditions (i. e. whether <b>marcescent</b> forests were present or not), thus providing a map of the Iberian submediterranean territories. Predictions of climate change were used to investigate possible climate-induced modifications in the boundaries of these territories in the near future. The patterns obtained show dramatic reductions in the extension of the Iberian submediterranean environment. Submediterranean conditions will probably disappear from the areas where they currently reign, and it seems unlikely that any new, large submediterranean areas will form by displacement towards higher altitudes. The outlook for the unique submediterranean vegetation of the Iberian Peninsula is gloomy...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Persistence of {{withered}} corollas after anthesis (‘corolla marcescence’) is widespread in angiosperms, yet its functional significance {{does not seem}} to have been explored for any species. This note reports the results of experiments assessing the fecundity effects of <b>marcescent</b> corollas in two southern Spanish insect-pollinated plants, Lavandula latifolia (Lamiaceae) and Viola cazorlensis (Violaceae). † Methods The effect of <b>marcescent</b> corollas on seed production was evaluated experimentally on wild-growing plants. Newly open flowers were randomly assigned to either control or treatment groups in experimental plants. After anthesis, withered corollas of treatment flowers were removed and those in control flowers were left in place. Fruits produced by treatment and control flowers were collected shortly before dehiscence and the number of seeds counted. † Key Results In V. cazorlensis, removal of withered corollas had no effect on percentage of fruit set, but mean seeds per fruit increased from 9. 5 to 11. 4. In L. latifolia, corolla removal had no effect on the number of seeds per fruit, but reduced the proportion of flowers ripening fruit from 60...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} some {{characteristics}} of <b>marcescent</b> leaves (withered retained leaves) and senescent leaves in Quercus subpyrenaica, a tree species that {{plays a major}} role in the climatic transition forests between temperate and mediterranean environments in north-eastern Spain. Leaves were taken from the upper and lower halves of the tree crown, both in the south- and north-exposed parts of the tree. Leaves receiving low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) undergo autumnal senescence, which is associated with decreases in photosynthetic pigments and decreases in the chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b ratio. Leaves receiving higher PPFD underwent senescence at a later date. Leaves situated in the upper, south-exposed part of the tree, which receive the highest PPFD, showed no signs of senescence and remained photosynthetically active for a longer period of time, marcescence occurring suddenly at the end of the season. Marcescence is unlikely to cause an improvement in nutrient recycling, since the removal of nutrients proceeded similarly in <b>marcescent</b> and senescent leaves. Marcescence may increase the time-span of the assimilation capacity for a significant period of time during September and October, when high light intensities and wild temperatures occur. The phenomena triggering Marcescence may be related to low temperatures. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFragmented leaf laminas {{were the}} only organ known of the fossil palms Sabalites longirhachis (Unger) J. Kvacek et Herman. Recently, {{isolated}} leaves of S. longirhachis, palm logs and rooting systems have been found associated in Fumanya, a new Maastrichtian locality from the Southern Pyrenees. This has allowed proposing a taphonomy-based hypothesis of the habit and paleoecology of these extinct palms. Fossil leaves are represented by complete laminas bearing petioles attached. Leaves and logs are parautochthonous {{at the base of}} the first coal seam of the stratigraphic succession. Rooting systems provide evidence for autochthony in coal layers formed at the top of lacustrine limestones. The tree bearing S. longirhachis leaves is reconstructed as relatively slender, of up to 14 m high, showing a smooth trunk with adventitious roots at the base and a crown keeping the <b>marcescent</b> leaves attached. The rooting system consisted of straight radial rootlets of about 1. 5 m in total diameter.
