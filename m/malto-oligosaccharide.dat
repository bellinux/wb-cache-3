40|$|Starch {{granules}} {{are composed}} of two types of glucose polymer, amylose and amylopectin, that differ in size and structure. One {{of the most intriguing}} challenges in understanding starch synthesis is to explain the apparently simultaneous synthesis of two such different polymers. One isoform of starch synthase, GBSSI, is responsible for amylose synthesis but can also contribute to amylopectin syn-thesis. The factors which determine the partitioning of GBSSI activity between these two processes are largely unknown. Understanding the properties of GBSSI and how these differ from the proper-ties of the amylopectin-synthesising isoforms of starch synthase are important {{to the understanding of the}} control of amylose synthesis. In this review, we will describe how the synthesis of amylose and amylopectin are integrated and what factors may determine the relative amounts of these two poly-mers.

40|$|An {{alpha-glucosidase}} {{with the}} ability to attack polymeric substrates was purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants of Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus DSM 567. The enzyme is apparently a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 160 kDa. Maximal activity is observed between pH 5 and 7 at 75 degrees C. The alpha-glucosidase is active towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucoside, maltose, malto-oligosaccharides, starch and pullulan. Highest activity is displayed towards the disaccharide maltose. In addition to glucose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose can be detected as the initial products of starch hydrolysis. After short incubations of pullulan, glucose is found as the only product. At high substrate concentrations, maltose and <b>malto-oligosaccharide,</b> but not glucose, are used as acceptors for glucosyl-transfer. These findings indicate that the T. thermohydrosulfuricus enzyme represents a novel type of alpha-glucosidase exhibiting maltase, glucohydrolase and 'maltodextrinohydrolase' activity...|$|E
40|$|A maltogenic amylase (MAG 1) from alkaliphilic Bacillus lehensis G 1 was cloned, {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli, purified and characterised for its hydrolysis and transglycosylation properties. The enzyme exhibited high stability at pH values from 7. 0 to 10. 0. The hydrolysis of b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) produced <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> of various lengths. In addition to hydrolysis, MAG 1 also demonstrated transglycosylation activity for {{the synthesis of}} longer <b>malto-oligosaccharides.</b> The thermodynamic equilibrium of the multiple reactions was shifted towards synthesis when the reaction conditions were optimised and the water activity was suppressed, {{which resulted in a}} yield of 38 % transglycosylation products consisting of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> of various lengths. Thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed the presence of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> with a higher degree of polymerisation than maltoheptaose, which has never been reported for other maltogenic amylases. The addition of organic solvents into the reaction further suppressed the water activity. The increase in the transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio from 1. 29 to 2. 15 and the increased specificity toward maltopentaose production demonstrated the enhanced synthetic property of the enzyme. The high transglycosylation activity of maltogenic amylase offers a great advantage for synthesising <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> and rar...|$|R
40|$|Sugars play an {{important}} role in the desiccation tolerance of most anhydrobiotic organisms. It has been shown in previous studies that different structural families of oligosaccharides have different efficacies to interact with phospholipid headgroups and protect membranes from solute leakage during drying. Here, we have compared three families of linear oligosaccharides (fructans (inulins), <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> manno-oligosaccharides) for their chain-length dependent protection of egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes against membrane fusion. We found increased protection with chain length up to a degree of polymerization (DP) of 5 for <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> and a decrease for inulins and manno-oligosaccharides. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that for all sugars the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased with DP, although to different degrees for the different oligosaccharide families. Higher Tg values resulted in reduced membrane fusion only for <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> below DP 5. Contrary to expectation, for inulins, manno-oligosaccharides and <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> of a DP above five, fusion increased with increasing Tg, indicating that other physical parameters are more important in determining the ability of different sugars to protect membranes against fusion during drying. Further research will be necessary to experimentally define such parameters...|$|R

Using {{soluble starch}} as donor, the CGTase from Thermoanaerobacter sp. showed the highest transglycosylation activity {{with all the}} <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> tested as accepters. At ratios of starch:D-glucose from 2 : 1 to 1 : 2 (w/w), the formation of cyclodextrins was completely inhibited, and a homologous series of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> (G(n)) was produced. The conversion of starch into acceptor products was {{in the range of}} 63 - 79 % in 48 h.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the granule {{structure}} on the methylation of starch was investigated by comparing the substitution patterns of potato starch methylated in granular suspension and in solution to DS 0. 3. Substitution patterns were analyzed by successive digestion with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase, fractionation of the resulting <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> mixture by GPC on a preparative scale, and characterization of the fractions by GLC and MALDI-MS. The mass composition of fractions with intermediate and higher degree of polymerization was indicative of enhanced clustering of substituents in granular methyl starch. On the contrary, {{the composition of the}} smaller saccharides was governed by enzyme specificity, which was also reflected in strong deviations in their monomer composition. A sequencing study on selected 'pure' small saccharides confirmed and complemented previous conclusions on enzyme specificity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Plants, green algae, and {{cyanobacteria}} synthesize storage polysaccharides by {{a similar}} ADPglucose-based pathway. Plant starch metabolism {{can be distinguished}} from that of bacterial glycogen {{by the presence of}} multiple forms of enzyme activities for each step of the pathway. This multiplicity does not coincide with any functional redundancy, as each form has seemingly acquired a distinctive and conserved role in starch metabolism. Comparisons of phenotypes generated by debranching enzyme-defective mutants in Escherichia coli and plants suggest that enzymes previously thought to be involved in polysaccharide degradation have been recruited during evolution to serve a particular purpose in starch biosynthesis. Speculations have been made that link this recruitment to the appearance of semicrystalline starch in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Besides the common core pathway, other enzymes of <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> metabolism are required for normal starch metabolism. However, according to the genetic and physiological system under study, these enzymes may have acquired distinctive roles...|$|E
40|$|Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is {{an enzyme}} {{belonging}} to the ol-amylase family that forms cyclodextrins (circularly linked oligosaccharides) from starch. X-ray work has indicated that this cyclization reaction of CGTase involves a 23 -Angstrom movement of the nonreducing end of a linear <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> from a remote binding position into the enzyme acceptor site. We have studied the dynamics of this sugar chain circularization through reaction path calculations. We used the new method of the stochastic path, {{which is based on}} path integral theory, to compute an approximate molecular dynamics trajectory of the large (75 -kDa) CGTase from Bacillus circulans strain 251 on a millisecond time scale. The result was checked for consistency with site-directed mutagenesis data. The combined data show how aromatic residues and a hydrophobic cavity at the surface of CGTase actively catalyze the sugar chain movement, Therefore, by using approximate trajectories, reaction path calculations can give a unique insight into the dynamics of complex enzyme reactions.

40|$|Until now starch and its {{metabolites}} <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> {{have been}} overlooked as potentially important constituents of carbohydrates in carrots. A {{comparison of the}} organically bred cultivars Rodelika and Robila with the hybrid cultivars Maestro F 1 and Starca F 1 revealed that the content of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> in the organic cultivars (126 and 191 mg g- 1 dry matter, respectively) surpassed the content in the two hybrid cultivars (86 and 89 mg g- 1 dry matter, respectively), although the starch content was similar in all cultivars (between 50 and 70 mg g- 1 dry matter). There were also cultivar differences {{in the pattern of}} glucose, fructose, and sucrose, however, the total amount of water-soluble carbohydrates (between 550 and 600 mg g- 1 dry matter) was similar in each cultivar.

40|$|Isoforms of starch synthase {{belonging}} to the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) class synthesize the amylose component of starch in plants. Other granule-bound isoforms of starch synthase, such as starch synthase II (SSII), are unable to synthesize amylose. The kinetic properties of GBSSI and SSII {{that are responsible for}} these functional differences have been investigated using starch granules from embryos of wild-type peas and rug 5 and lam mutant peas, which contain, respectively, both GBSSI and SSII, GBSSI but not SSII and SSII but not GBSSI. We show that GBSSI in isolated granules elongates <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> processively, adding more than one glucose molecule for each enzyme-glucan encounter. Granule-bound SSII can elongate <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> but has a lower affinity for these than GBSSI and does not elongate processively. As a result of these properties GBSSI synthesizes longer <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> than SSII. The significance of these results with respect to the roles of GBSSI and SSII in vivo is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the properties in soluble form of two isoforms of starch synthase. One of these, granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), {{is responsible for}} the synthesis of amylose inside the amylopectin matrix of the starch granule in vivo. The other, starch synthase II (SSII), is involved in amylopectin synthesis. Both isoforms can use amylopectin and <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> as substrates in vitro. As well as acting as a substrate for GBSSI, amylopectin acts as an effector of this isoform, increasing the rate at which it elongates malto-oligosaccharides and promoting a processive rather than distributive mode of elongation of these compounds. The affinity of GBSSI for amylopectin as an effector is greater than its affinity for amylopectin as a substrate. The rate and mode of elongation of malto-oligosaccharides by SSII are not influenced by amylopectin. These results suggest that specific interaction with amylopectin in the matrix of the starch granule is a unique property of GBSSI and is critical in determining the nature of its products...|$|E
40|$|Retrogradation of {{amorphous}} thermoplastic starch (TPS) films {{obtained by}} compression moulding of spray dried amorphous powder was investigated. The {{aim of the}} work was to study the influence of <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> molecular weight, i. e. dextrose equivalents (DEs), {{on the performance of}} the powders and the films. Amorphous TPS films were obtained, irrespective of the additive used. At a relative humidity (RH) of 0 % and 50 % all samples maintained their amorphous nature while at RH 100 % retrogradation was suppressed for all formulated starch films. It is shown that the rate of moisture uptake, and as a consequence, the rate of retrogradation, depends on the molecular weight of the additive. FT-IR and TGA measurements proved a more effective interaction of starch with low molecular weight additives such as maltose and glucose syrup (DE 38. 2) than for the higher molecular weight maltodextrine (DE 19. 1).

Libraries of variants were constructed and screened on sucrose allowing {{the identification of}} 17 mutants able to synthesize molecules from sole sucrose, which are not synthesized by the parental wildtype enzyme. Three of the isolated mutants {{as well as the}} new products synthesized were characterized in details. Mutants contain between 7 and 11 mutations in the active site and the new molecules were identified as being a sucrose derivative, named erlose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 4) -alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 2) -beta-D-Fructose), and a new <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> named panose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 6) -alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 4) -alpha-D-Glucose). These product specificities were never reported for none of the amylosucrases characterized to date, nor their engineered variants. Optimization of the production of these trisaccharides of potential interest as sweeteners or prebiotic molecules was carried out.

40|$|Maltogenic amylase (MAG 1) from Bacillus lehensis G 1 {{displayed}} the highest hydrolysis activity on β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) to produce maltose {{as a main}} product and exhibited high transglycosylation activity on <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> with polymerization degree of three and above. These substrate and product specificities of MAG 1 were elucidated from structural {{point of view in}} this study. A three-dimensional structure of MAG 1 was constructed using homology modeling. Docking of β-CD and <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> was then performed in the MAG 1 active site. An aromatic platform in the active site was identified which is responsible in substrate recognition especially in determining the enzyme's preference toward β-CD. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed MAG 1 structure is most stable when docked with β-CD and least stable when docked with maltose. The docking analysis and MD simulation showed that the main subsites for substrate stabilization in the active site are - 2, - 1, + 1 and + 2. A bulky residue, Trp 359 at the + 2 subsite was identified to cause steric interference to the bound linear <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> thus prevented it to occupy subsite + 3, which can only be reached by a highly bent glucose molecule such as β-CD. The resulted modes of binding from docking simulation show a good correlation with the experimentally determined hydrolysis pattern. The subsite structure generated from this study led to a possible mode of action that revealed how maltose was mainly produced during hydrolysis. Furthermore, maltose only occupies subsite + 1 and + 2, therefore could not be hydrolyzed or transglycosylated by the enzyme.

A starch-degrading activity was detected in homogenates of the protonema, after successive extraction with phosphate buffer and buffer containing 3 M LiCl. Buffer-soluble extract (BS) and LiCl-soluble extract (LS) readily hydrolyzed amylopectin to liberate only glucose, which shows that α-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 20) in BS and LS hydrolyzed amylopectin. The K m value of BS for maltose was 0. 427. The K m value of BS for <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> decreased {{with an increase in}} the molecular mass of the substrate.

The stDPE 2 protein was demonstrated {{to be present}} in chloroplasts and to accumulate at times of active starch degradation in potato leaves and tubers. Transgenic potato plants were made in which its presence was almost completely eliminated. It could be demonstrated that starch degradation was repressed in leaves of the transgenic plants but that cold-induced sweetening was not affected in tubers stored at 4 °C. No evidence could be found for an effect of repression of stDPE 2 on starch synthesis. The <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> content of leaves from the transgenic plants was assessed. It was found that the amounts of malto-oligosaccharides increased in all plants during the dark period and that the transgenic lines accumulated up to 10 -fold more than the control. Separation of these malto-oligosaccharides by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed-amperometric detection showed that the only one that accumulated in the transgenic plants in comparison with the control was maltose. stDPE 2 was purified to apparent homogeneity from potato tuber extracts and could be demonstrated to transfer glucose from maltose to oyster glycogen...|$|E

The two plastidial phosphorylases are shown {{to function as}} homodimers containing two 91 -kDa (PhoA) subunits and two 110 -kDa (PhoB) subunits. Both lack the typical 80 -amino-acid insertion found in the higher plant plastidial forms. PhoB is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by ADP-glucose and has a low affinity for <b>malto-oligosaccharides.</b> PhoA is more similar to the higher plant plastidial phosphorylases: it is moderately sensitive to ADP-glucose inhibition and has a high affinity for unbranched <b>malto-oligosaccharides.</b> Molecular analysis establishes that STA 4 encodes PhoB. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains carrying mutations at the STA 4 locus display {{a significant decrease in}} amounts of starch during storage that correlates with the accumulation of abnormally shaped granules containing a modified amylopectin structure and a high amylose content.

40|$|AbstractSugars play an {{important}} role in the desiccation tolerance of most anhydrobiotic organisms and disaccharides have been extensively investigated for their ability to stabilize model membranes in the dry state. Much less is known about the ability of oligosaccharides to protect dry membranes. However, it has been shown that different structural families of oligosaccharides have different efficacies to interact with and protect membranes during drying. Here, we have compared three families of linear oligosaccharides (fructans, <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> manno-oligosaccharides) for their chain-length dependent lyoprotective effect on egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. We found increased protection with chain length for the fructans, a moderate decrease in protection with chain length for <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> and a strong decrease for manno-oligosaccharides. Using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we show that the degree of lyoprotection of the different sugars is closely related to their influence on the gel to liquid–crystalline phase behavior of the dry membranes and to the extent of H-bonding to different groups (CO, PO, choline) in the lipids. Possible structural characteristics of the different oligosaccharides that may determine the extent to which they are able to interact with and protect membranes are discussed...|$|R

These GOS products were first subjected to HPLC-SEC, calibrated HPAEC-PAD profiling (glucose units in relation to a <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> ladder), and 1 D (1) H NMR spectroscopy. For a more detailed analysis and support of the conclusions based on the initial analysis, the GOS products were separated into DP-pure subpools on Bio-Gel P- 2 (MALDI-TOF-MS analysis), which were subjected to calibrated HPAEC-PAD profiling and (1) H NMR analysis. Unidentified peaks from different GOS products, not present in Vivinal GOS, were isolated for detailed structural characterization.

40|$|AbstractBackground: MalT from Escherichia coli, the best-studied {{member of}} the MalT family of ATP-dependent {{transcriptional}} activators, regulates the genes for <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> utilization. The active form of this 4 domain protein is a homooligomer, and its multimerization is induced by the binding of maltotriose. Domains II and III of MalT were suggested to mediate the oligomerization process, but its molecular mechanism and the specific functions of these domains remain to be identified. Results: We solved the crystal structure of MalT domain III at 1. 45 Å resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement phasing. The structure reveals eight copies of a two-helix bundle motif arranged in a novel, right-handed superhelix fold with closed walls, followed by a small C-terminal subdomain. The MalT superhelix contains a potential maltotriose binding site and forms a large hydrophobic protein-protein interaction interface that mediates the contact between two MalT domain III molecules. Structure-based analysis of the two-helix bundle motifs revealed a novel degenerated sequence pattern, and repeats of this pattern could be identified in other regulator proteins. Conclusions: MalT domain III contains a novel superhelix fold. Its protein-protein interaction interface, however, resembles protein binding sites of other superhelical proteins, suggesting a model with domain III mediating MalT oligomerization. Maltotriose seems to modulate the interaction interface and MalT oligomerization by occupying the ligand binding site inside the superhelix. Similar structural and mechanistic features in other MalT protein-family members and unrelated regulator proteins are indicated by the reappearance of a novel sequence motif derived from the MalT domain III structure...|$|E

The enzyme presented 29 % of glycosylation, an isoelectric point of 6. 8 and a molecular weight of 56 and 52 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Bio-Sil-Sec- 400 gel filtration column, respectively. The enzyme showed typical alpha-glucosidase activity, hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside and presented an optimum temperature and pH of 65 A degrees C and 6. 0, respectively. In the absence of substrate the purified alpha-glucosidase was stable for 60 min at 60 A degrees C, presenting t (50) of 90 min at 65 A degrees C. Hydrolysis of polysaccharide substrates by alpha-glucosidase decreased {{in the order of}} glycogen, amylose, starch and amylopectin. Among malto-oligosaccharides the enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> (G 10), maltopentaose, maltotetraose, maltotriose and maltose. Isomaltose, trehalose and beta-ciclodextrin were poor substrates, and sucrose and alpha-ciclodextrin were not hydrolyzed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{adsorption}} {{properties of}} water molecules on oligo and polysaccharides {{are attributed to}} the OH groups of the glucose rings in the molecules. The water molecules are adsorbed onto OH groups by hydrogen bond formation. Near infrared spectroscopic and gravimetric techniques were used in analysing the adsorption characteristics of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> and some polysaccharides. Near infrared spectra of the dry oligo and polysaccharides were acquired during the adsorption of water molecules at a relative humidity of 50 - 55 %. The amounts of water adsorbed by the samples were also recorded by an analytical balance. Second derivative techniques were used in decomposing the OH combination frequencies of the adsorbed water molecules in the region 5300 - 5000 cm- 1.

However, anti-α-glucosidase Ⅲ serum precipitated specifically with α-glucosidase Ⅲ. α－グルコシダーゼの分子多型が各種クロマトグラフィーによりホウレンソウ種子から単離された。α－グルコシダーゼⅠ、Ⅱ、Ⅲ、Ⅳの分子量は、それぞれSDS－PAGEにより 78 、 78 、 82 、 82 kDA、ゲル濾過のより 62, 62, 190 、 70 kDであった。α-グルコシダーゼⅠとⅡは、可溶性デンプンを基質とした際のKm値がマルトースよりも約 10 倍低く、さらに、α－グルカンだけでなくマルトオリゴ糖に対しても高い活性を示すことから、同じような酵素的特性を持つことが示された。最適pHは 4. 5 ｶﾗ 5. 5 を示し、温度安定性は 70 ℃、 20 分処理で約 50 ％の残存活性を示した。一方、α－グルコシダーゼⅢとⅣは、マルトースを基質とした際のKm値が可溶性デンプンよりも 3 － 4 倍低い値を示し、マルトオリゴ糖に対しては高い活性を示すが、α－グルカンに対してはほとんど活性を示さないことから、同じような酵素的特性を有することが示された。最適pHは 4. 5 － 5. 5 、そして 70 ℃、 20 分処理では活性が認められなかった。しかしながら、抗α－グルコシダーゼⅢ血清は、α－グルコシダーゼⅢに対してのみ特異的に沈降線を形成した...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{properties of}} water molecules on oligo and polysaccharides {{are attributed to}} the OH groups of the glucose rings in the molecules. The water molecules are adsorbed onto OH groups by hydrogen bond formation. Near infrared spectroscopic and gravimetric techniques were used in analysing the adsorption characteristics of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> and some polysaccharides. Near infrared spectra of the dry oligo and polysaccharides were acquired during the adsorption of water molecules at a relative humidity of 50 - 55 %. The amounts of water adsorbed by the samples were also recorded by an analytical balance. Second derivative techniques were used in decomposing the OH combination frequencies of the adsorbed water molecules in the region 5300 - 5000 cm - 1. The {{results indicate that the}} water molecules are adsorbed on to C 2 and C 3 -OH groups at a higher rate compared to the adsorption onto C 1 -OH groups in the molecules. Adsorption also takes place onto the ethereal oxygen atoms in the glucose rings in malto-oligosaccarides. The gravimetric results show that the adsorption of water molecules increases with the number of glucose units in the <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> except maltotriose which has the highest adsorption over a period of 75 minutes. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics of amylose and amylopectin are similar...|$|R
40|$|Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) catalyzes three transglycosylation {{reactions}} via {{a double}} displacement mechanism involving a covalent enzyme-intermediate complex (substituted-enzyme intermediate). Characterization {{of the three}} transglycosylation reactions, however, revealed that they differ in their kinetic mechanisms. Disproportionation (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond of a linear malto-oligosaccharide: and transfer of one pad to an acceptor substrate) proceeds according to a ping-pong mechanism. Cyclization (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond in amylose or starch and subsequent formation of a cyclodextrin) is a single-substrate reaction with an affinity for the high molecular mass substrate used, which was too high to allow elucidation of the kinetic mechanism. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, however, have been observed using shorter amylose chains. Coupling (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond in a cyclodextrin ring and transfer of the resulting linear <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> to an acceptor substrate) proceeds according to a random ternary complex mechanism. In view of the different kinetic mechanisms observed for the various reactions, which {{can be related to}} differences in substrate binding, {{it should be possible to}} mutagenize CGTase in such. a manner that a single reaction is affected most strongly. Construction of CGTase mutants that synthesize linear oligosaccharides instead of cyclodextrins thus appears feasible. Furthermore, the rate of interconversion of linear and circular conformations of oligosaccharides in the cyclization and coupling reactions was found to determine the reaction rate. In the cyclization reaction this conversion rate, together with initial binding of the high molecular mass substrate, may determine the product specificity of the enzyme. These new insights will allow rational design of CGTase mutant enzymes synthesizing cyclodextrins of specific sizes...|$|E
40|$|Malto-oligosaccharides {{have high}} {{potential}} as food ingredient, {{due to their}} beneficial effects on the flavour and physico-chemical properties of food products. They have mild sweetness, increase the viscosity and have been suggested to delay the retrogradation of starch. As native starch is only slowly degradable by amylases, the first steps in the conversion of starch are gelatinization and liquefaction of the starch polymers. The obtained maltodextrins can then be used for saccharification, i. e. the further hydrolysis to malto-oligosaccharides. Depending on {{the properties of the}} amylases used for saccharification, different <b>malto-oligosaccharide</b> enriched syrups can be obtained. In this study, a maltotriose producing amylase from Microbacterium imperiale and a maltotetraose producing amylase from Pseudomonas stutzeri were used to produce maltotriose and maltotetraose enriched syrups, respectively. The maltotriose producing amylase showed the highest activity around 40 °C and pH 6. 5 – 7. 5 while this was reached around 50 °C and pH 5. 5 – 6. 5 for the maltotetraose producing amylase. These data were used to optimize the production of maltotriose and maltotetraose syrups. The highest yields of maltotriose were obtained after incubation of a 20 % maltodextrin solution with 5. 6 units maltotriose producing amylase / g dry matter (dm) maltodextrin for 36 h at 40 °C and pH 5. 5. One enzyme unit is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 µmol reducing sugars per mL from a 1. 0 % soluble starch solution per min at pH 6. 0 and 40 °C. Incubation of a 20 % maltodextrin solution with 3. 5 units maltotetraose producing amylase / g dm maltodextrin for 28 h at 50 °C and pH 5. 5 gave the highest yields of maltotetraose. The obtained syrups were further enriched in maltotriose or maltotetraose in one step by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and collecting specific fractions, or in two steps by selective fermentation of glucose, maltose (and maltotriose) in the syrups with specific yeast strains and ethanol precipitation to remove larger glucose chains. SEC produces maltotriose and maltotetraose of high purity, but the yields are low. It was possible to selectively ferment glucose and maltose (for the maltotriose enriched syrup) and glucose, maltose and maltotriose (for the maltotetraose enriched syrup) by making use of two different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains. Next to that, larger glucose chains can be removed with ethanol precipitation. Under the experimental conditions, an ethanol concentration of 60 % was necessary to precipitate large glucose chains without precipitation of maltotriose and maltotetraose. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Lytic {{polysaccharide}} monooxygenases (LPMOs) are {{recently discovered}} enzymes that oxidatively deconstruct polysaccharides. LPMOs are fundamental in the effective utilization of these substrates by bacteria and fungi; moreover, the enzymes have significant industrial importance. We report here the activity, spectroscopy and three-dimensional {{structure of a}} starch-active LPMO, {{a representative of the}} new CAZy AA 13 family. We demonstrate that these enzymes generate aldonic acid-terminated <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> from retrograded starch and boost significantly the conversion of this recalcitrant substrate to maltose by β-amylase.

40|$|Doubly charged sodiated and permethylated linear <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> ({Glc} 6 -{Glc} 9), {{branched}} N-linked glycans (high-mannose type GlcNAc 2 Man 5 - 9, {{and complex}} asialo- and disialylated-biantennary glycans) {{were analyzed by}} tandem mass spectrometry using collisionally-activated dissociation (CAD) and “hot” electron capture dissociation (ECD) available in a custom-built ESI FTICR mass spectrometer. For linear permethylated <b>malto-oligosaccharides,</b> both CAD and “hot” ECD produced glycosidic cleavages (B, Y, C, and Z ions), cross-ring cleavages (A- and X-type), and internal cleavages (B/Y and C/Y type) to provide sequence and linkage information. For the branched N-linked glycans, CAD and “hot” ECD provided complementary structural information. CAD generated abundant B and Y fragment ions by glycosidic cleavages, whereas “hot” ECD produced dominant C and Z ions. A-type cross-ring cleavages were present in CAD spectra. Complementary A- and X-type cross-ring fragmentation pairs were generated by “hot” ECD, and these delineated the branching patterns and linkage positions. For example, 0, 4 An and 3, 5 An ions defined the linkage position of the major branch as the 6 -position of the central core mannose residue. The internal fragments observed in CAD were more numerous and abundant than in “hot” ECD spectra. Since the triply charged (sodiated) molecular ion of the permethylated disialylated-biantennary N-linked glycan has relatively high abundance, it was isolated and fragmented in a “hot” ECD experiment and extensive fragment ions (glycosidic and complementary pairs of cross-ring cleavages) were generated to fully confirm the sequence, branching, and linkage assignments for this glycan...|$|R
40|$|Ageing causes {{retrogradation}} or recrystallisation of starch, {{which leads}} to staling of food products and embrittlement of non-food starch products. Some plasticisers are known to reduce retrogradation, {{but it is not}} clear how. In chapter 1, an overview is given of the present knowledge of starch. In chapter 2, the analytical techniques and their applicabilities in starch research are presented. In chapter 3, retrogradation and sub-Tg physical ageing are described of gelatinised starch, as studied with infrared and NMR relaxation spectroscopy. The influence of processing temperature on initial crystallinity and subsequent recrystallisation (by X-ray diffraction) are described of compression moulded starch, plasticised by water and glycerol. In chapters 4 - 6, the interaction between starch and the plasticisers glycerol or ethylene glycol in the absence of water are described. In chapter 4, the interaction is described to cause a strong exothermal DSC transition. With solid state NMR spectroscopy, an immobilisation of the plasticisers and mobilisation of starch were observed. Upon storage at room temperature, the interaction also occurred, but faster for ethylene glycol than for glycerol, and glycerol interacted mainly with amorphous starch. Less plasticiser molecules interacted with more of their hydroxy groups than upon heating. In chapter 5, the interaction between dry amylopectin and ethylene glycol is described as studied by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Ethylene glycol was suggested to form intra-chain H-bonded bridges between the amylopectin chains, increasing chain stiffness and increasing the glass transition. Ethylene glycol was confined to nanometer sized droplets, as the dynamics changed from VFT towards Arrhenius behaviour. In chapter 6, the interaction was studied by Inverse Recovery Cross Polarisation NMR spectroscopy. At room temperature, the plasticiser mobility decreased and the amylopectin C 6 mobility increased. The mobilities of the other amylopectin carbons did not change. The interaction mainly occurs at C 6. Upon heating, the interaction develops fast, after which crystal perfection is assumed to take place. Crystal perfection is slower for glycerol than for ethylene glycol. In chapters 7 and 8, retrogradation is described of fully and partly gelatinised starch with several plasticisers. Due to partial gelatinisation, some granular structure remained, appearing as non-crystalline ghosts. These may act as nuclei for crystallisation. In chapter 7, systems are described with a range of plasticisers, increasing in size and number of hydroxy groups (ethylene glycol, glycerol, threitol, xylitol, glucose and for potato starch also maltose). The larger the number of OH groups, the better the plasticiser reduced the crystallisation inducing effect of ghosts in potato starch. Wheat starch recrystallised to a lesser extent (X-ray crystallinity indices of ~ 0. 4 vs. ~ 0. 5 for potato starch), probably because of the shorter amylopectin chains. Wheat starch did not show clear trends for the influence of plasticiser size and of ghosts. In chapter 8, retrogradation is described of wheat starch with a range of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> (maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose and maltohexaose). <b>Malto-oligosaccharides</b> substantially reduced retrogradation (crystallinity indices of ~ 0. 2). No trend was found for the influence of ghosts. The finding that maltose reduced retrogradation substantially better than glucose (chapter 7), is of practical importance for starch based foods. <b>Malto-oligosaccharides</b> consisting of 6 or more glucose residues (6 residues are needed for helix formation) were proposed to increase retrogradation because of co-crystallisation. The smaller <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> were assumed to reduce retrogradation by intruding between the starch chains...|$|R
40|$|The Glycoside Hydrolase (GH) family 70 {{originally}} was established for glucansucrase enzymes, solely found in lactic acid bacteria, synthesizing α-glucan polysaccharides from sucrose (e. g. GtfA). In recent {{years we have}} characterized GtfB and related Lactobacillus enzymes as 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferase enzymes. These GtfB type of enzymes constitute a first GH 70 subfamily, unable to act on sucrose as substrate, but active with maltodextrins and starch, cleaving (α 1 → 4) linkages and synthesizing linear (α 1 → 6) -glucan chains. The GtfB disproportionating type of activity results in conversion of <b>malto-oligosaccharides</b> into IsoMalto-/Malto-Polysaccharides with a relatively high percentage of (α 1 → 6) linkages. This paper reports the identification of a second GH 70 subfamily (designated GtfC enzymes) and the characterization of the Exiguobacterium sibiricum 255 - 15 GtfC enzyme, also inactive with sucrose and displaying 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferase activity with <b>malto-oligosaccharides.</b> GtfC differs from GtfB in synthesizing IsoMalto-/Malto-Oligosaccharides. Biochemically the GtfB and GtfC type of enzymes are related but phylogenetically they clearly constitute different GH 70 subfamilies, displaying only 30 % sequence identity. Whereas GtfB type of enzymes largely have the same domain order as glucansucrases (with α-amylase domains A, B, C, plus domains IV and V), this GtfC type of enzyme differs {{in the order of}} these domains and completely lacks domain V. In GtfC the sequence of the conserved regions I-IV of clan GH-H is identical to that in GH 13 (I-II-III-IV) but different from that in GH 70 (II-III-IV-I due to a circular permutation of the (β/α) 8 -barrel). The GtfC 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferase enzymes thus represent structurally and functionally very interesting evolutionary intermediates between α-amylase and glucansucrase enzymes...|$|R
