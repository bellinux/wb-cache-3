It is known that a proper statistical analysis concerning elasticities can be performed only with the bayesian approach. <b>Morover</b> we {{can take advantage of}} this methodology to form reasonable priors using national data.

The low posterior probability than inequality constraints hold with an noninformative prior shows how bayesian methods can be fruitfully employed to assess regional elasticities with a proper prior obtained from national data. ...|$|E
