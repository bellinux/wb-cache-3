Temperature varies from around 49 C for milk chocolate to up to 82 C for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction. [...] The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the conche removes some <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor.

Burial by other sediments results in increasing temperature, depending on the local geothermal gradient and tectonic setting, and increasing pressure. This causes compaction of the material and loss {{of some of the}} water and volatile matter (primarily methane and carbon dioxide). This process, called coalification, concentrates the carbon content, and thus the heat content, of the material. Deeper burial and the passage of time result in further expulsion of <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> matter, eventually transforming the material into higher rank coals such as bituminous and anthracite coal.|$|E

Two eucalyptus species harvested in South Carolina, E. benthamii and E. macarthurii, were processed in a torrefier, and wood pellets were manufactured. Eucalyptus represents a promising biomass source in southern U. S. due to fast growth rates and the availability of cold-tolerant plantations. Analyses of <b>moisture</b> content, proximate <b>and</b> elemental composition, and net heating value of “light roasted” wood were assessed. The heating value of the eucalypts and pellets was enhanced by 19 % (average), compared to the original material, while the <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> content were drastically reduced. This reduction leads to an increase in the amount (w/w) of carbon, enhancing the energy content in the material.

The pellets showed increased energy density, providing improved properties for transportation and handling...|$|R

Problems can exist in utilising biomass fuels however such as high <b>moisture</b> contents <b>and</b> low calorific value when compared with fossil fuels. Torrefaction is a pre-treatment process that aims {{to address some of}} these issues. In this pre-treatment step, solid biomass is heated in an inert atmosphere to between temperatures between 200 and 300 °C resulting in the loss of low-energy <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> improving fuel chemical and physical properties and is the focus of this thesis work. Firstly, the effect of changing torrefaction temperature and residence time is investigated. Results show that torrefaction increases the calorific value of fuels via reduction in <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> contents as a result of degradation of some of the lignocellulosic components- this also improving the grindability characteristics of torrefied materials- with these change more pronounced as conditions become more severe. Results further show that with increasing torrefaction severity, the solid product yields decrease while the liquid and gaseous products increase. The combustion properties of torrefied biomass is also investigated, with results showing that torrefaction reduces the reactivity of biomass fuels and that upon rapid devolatilisation, chars from torrefied fuels differ morphologically to those of untreated biomass and undergo a lesser degree of burnout. Results also show that promotion of nitrogen to the gas phase during rapid devolatilisation may be fuel dependent after torrefaction has been performed. Finally, the effect of torrefaction of supply chain GHG emissions is investigated where it was found that GHG savings can be made as a result of increased calorific value in torrefied materials. Emissions savings are maximised where heat integration of the combustion of the volatiles gases evolved during torrefaction is implemented and wood chips are used as utility fuel. Results also indicate that torrefaction favours long distance transport as a result of improved fuel properties. ...|$|R

Modelling of these fuel beds {{can give a}} better understanding of the conversion process inside them, and provide a tool for analyzing the performance of furnaces and problems related to the fuel bed. The complexity of the task is however significant and there are at present no models considering all phenomenon related to a bed in a grate furnace. To give reasonable computational times the models depend on simplifications. One simplification often used is the neglect of gradients within individual fuel particles. The influence of this approximation has been investigated in this work. A bed model and a single particle model are presented. The bed model is a one-dimensional model describing the conversion of a batch of biofuels ignited at the top while combustion air is fed from below. All conversion stages are considered; drying, devolatilisation, heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. The particle model is two-dimensional and describes heating, drying and devolatilisation of a particle inside the bed. The surface temperature, given by a simulation with the bed model, is used as boundary condition. The bed and particle model are linked to each other to account for intra-particle gradients in the conversion of the fuel bed. The linking is carried out in an iterative manner in which the bed and particle model are run in series. The bed model provides the boundary condition for the particle model which in turn gives input parameters to the bed model to reflect the impact of intra-particle gradients.
