This trouble is mitigated by the use of trifocal lenses or by the use of <b>monofocal</b> lenses for computer users.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{intraocular lenses}} {{are used to}} replace the eye's natural lens that is removed during {{cataract}} surgery. These lenses have been increasing in popularity since the 1960s, {{but it was not}} until 1981 that the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this type of product was issued. The development of intraocular lenses brought about an innovation as patients previously did not have their natural lens replaced and as a result had to wear very thick eyeglasses or some special type of contact lenses.Presently, IOLs are especially designed for patients with different vision problems. The main types of IOLs that now exist are divided into <b>monofocal</b> and multifocal lenses.|$|E
50|$|Cataract surgery may be {{performed}} to correct vision problems in both eyes, {{and in these}} cases, patients are usually advised to consider monovision. This procedure involves inserting in one eye an intraocular lens that provides near vision {{and in the other}} eye an IOL that provides distance vision. Although most patients can adjust to having implanted <b>monofocal</b> lenses in both eyes, some cannot and may experience blurred vision at both near and far distances. IOLs that emphasize distance vision may be mixed with IOLs that emphasize intermediate vision in order to achieve a type of modified monovision. Bausch and Lomb developed in 2004 the first aspheric IOLs which provide better contrast sensitivity by having their periphery flatter than the middle of the lens. However, some cataract surgeons have debated the benefits of aspheric IOLs, because the contrast sensitivity benefit may not last in older patients.|$|E
5000|$|By {{utilizing}} the iris sphincter muscle, some species move the lens back and forth, some stretch the lens flatter. Another mechanism regulates focusing chemically and independently of these two, by controlling {{growth of the}} eye and maintaining focal length. In addition, the pupil shape {{can be used to}} predict the focal system being utilized. A slit pupil can indicate the common multifocal system, while a circular pupil usually specifies a <b>monofocal</b> system. When using a circular form, the pupil will constrict under bright light, increasing the focal length, and will dilate when dark in order to decrease the depth of focus. [...] Note that a focusing method is not a requirement. As photographers know, focal errors increase as aperture increases. Thus, countless organisms with small eyes are active in direct sunlight and survive with no focus mechanism at all. As a species grows larger, or transitions to dimmer environments, a means of focusing need only appear gradually.|$|E
50|$|Intraocular lens (IOL) is a lens {{implanted}} in the eye {{as part of a}} treatment for cataracts or myopia. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens, and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia, or nearsightedness. IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed <b>monofocal</b> lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Multifocal glued IOLs {{have been}} done with the ReZoom (Abbott Medical Optics), and Tecnis (Advanced Medical Optics or AMO) IOLs. This makes it {{possible}} to offer the accommodative IOL advantage even to patients with an absent capsule. The modified Prolene polyvinylidene fluoride haptic in these IOLs helps in being more stiff as well as having superior memory. Sutured scleral-fixated IOLs in pediatric eyes have been known to be associated with problems.Multifocal IOLs allow good vision at a range of distances. <b>Monofocal</b> intraocular lenses which are commonly available give clear point of focus in the distance or closer, but you can choose only one focal point. Multifocal intraocular lenses are designed to avoid the need for glasses by providing two or more points of focus. These intraocular lenses are intended to be placed in the capsular bag. Until recently, it was difficult to provide multifocality for patients who had complicated cataract surgeries which lack normal capsules. Aphakia with deficient capsule has been a limitation for obtaining multifocality. Now multifocality is possible even in complicated cataract surgeries by the Multifocal Glued IOL procedure. In this multifocal IOL implantation is done even in eyes with large posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and aphakias with deficient posterior capsule.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} rotational {{stability and}} its influ-ence on postoperative visual acuity of different <b>monofocal</b> and multifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHODS: A prospective interventional study was designed. Ninety-one {{patients with a}} mean age of 71. 65 ± 11. 82 years were implanted with toric IOLs after phacoemulsification. Three <b>monofocal</b> toric IOLs (the Lentis LT [Oculentis, Berlin, Germany], enVista [Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY], and AcrySof IQ [Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX]) and one multifocal toric IOL (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR; Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) were implanted. Preoperative and postoperative images were taken to calculate the misalignment due to the marking method. To evaluate rotation in the different follow-up visits, another photograph was taken 1 hour and 1, 7 and 30 days postoperatively. Refraction, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), and corrected distance visual acuity were measured 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative UDVA was 0. 1 logMAR or better in 64. 6 % of eyes implanted with <b>monofocal</b> IOLs and 46. 4 % of eyes implanted with multifocal IOLs. The enVista toric IOL showed the best UDVA compared to the other <b>monofocal</b> IOLs, with 81 % of eyes with 0. 1 logMAR or better.

Methods: Patients with different binocular IOLs implanted were recruited after surgery and had their visual acuity tested, and quality of vision evaluated, at a single diagnostic visit between 3 and 8 months after second-eye surgery. Lenses tested included an aspheric <b>monofocal</b> and two apodized diffractive multifocal IOLs with slightly different design parameters. A total of 94 patients were evaluated. Results: Subjects with the ReSTOR® + 2. 5 D IOL had better near and intermediate vision than those subjects with a <b>monofocal</b> IOL. Intermediate vision was similar to, and near vision slightly lower than, that of subjects with a ReSTOR® + 3. 0 D IOL implanted. The preferred reading distance was slightly farther out for the + 2. 5 D relative to the + 3. 0 D lens, and farthest for the <b>monofocal.</b> Visual acuity at the preferred reading distance was equal with the two multifocal IOLs and significantly worse with the <b>monofocal</b> IOL.

Measurements were made monocularly under mesopic conditions {{at a distance of}} 2  metres from the monitor with best distance refraction plus 0. 5  D at 0. 5,  1,  3,  6,  11. 4, and 22. 8  cycles per degree (cpd). The test was then repeated for the multifocal IOLs, adding minus 2. 5  D to the best distance refraction to force the patient to use the near focus. Both lenses were also investigated under glare conditions with the same set-up and using the brightness acuity tester (BAT).  RESULTS—The tritan CCS function without glare in multifocal lenses through the distance focus was nearly identical to that through the near focus. The following statistically significant differences were measured: the CCS function without glare for the multifocal lens was worse at 0. 5  cpd and 1. 0  cpd than that of the <b>monofocal</b> lens. In CCS testing of the multifocal group with glare at 6  cpd, the results through the distance focus were better than the results through the near focus.

40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} the optical performances of 3 types of diffractive hydrophobic intraocular lenses (IOLs) : <b>monofocal</b> achromatic, bifocal and trifocal, using various visible wavelengths. Methods 3 IOLs were measured with an optical bench (PMTF,LambdaX,Nivelles, Belgium) to determine modulation transfer function (MTF) and point spread function (PSF). Measurements were performed at 480 nm, 546 nm, 650 nm using an aberration free cornea and aspheric artificial cornea generating + 0. 28 µm positive spherical aberration by ISO 11979 - 2 guidelines. Through-focus MTF was recorded for various pupil apertures. Evaluation of halos was performed from PSF measurements obtained at each focal spot location. Images of USAF targets were recorded with simulated distances from 1 m to 25 cm. Amplitude of off-axis peaks of radial profile of PSF enabled to quantify percentage of energy within the halos. Results The <b>monofocal</b> and the bifocal IOLs presented 2 peaks on the through-focus MTF in green light: intermediate vision (at + 1. 75 D) for the <b>monofocal</b> achromatic lens, and far and near vision (at + 4 D) for the bifocal IOL {{of the same}} material. Three peaks (Distance, Intermediate at + 1. 75 D, Near at + 3. 5 D) were recorded with the trifocal IOL at any wavelength. The achromatic <b>monofocal</b> IOL was <b>monofocal</b> for far vision with red light and <b>monofocal</b> for near vision with blue light. The influence of the cornea models was limited.

40|$|The {{following}} paper compares contrast sensitivity, glare, post-operational visual acuity, independency {{of glasses}} and patient satisfaction of {{three groups of}} patients with regards to three types of interocular lenses: multifocal lenses Acrysof ReSTOR SN 60 D 3 with blue filter (19 patients), aspheric <b>monofocal</b> lenses without blue filter AMO Tecnis Z 9002 (21 patients) and <b>monofocal</b> lenses with blue light filter Alcon AcrySof IQ Aspheric - SN 60 WF (21 patients). The inclusion criterion {{for this study was}} that patients have only a cataract and no pathological ailments. In regards to contrast sensitivity, patients tested with aspheric <b>monofocal</b> lenses with blue filter SN 60 WF had better results than patients with aspheric <b>monofocal</b> lenses without blue filter Z 9002 and with multifocal lenses with blue filter ReSTOR. These differences however were not significant and did not affect patient satisfaction. This study shows that a blue filter can have a positive influence on the contrast sensitivity under photopic and mesopic conditions. Post-operational tests show that, in contrast to most of the patients with <b>monofocal</b> lenses, the patients who had multifocal implants could read without the help of glasses. The potential uncorrected visual acuity of patients of monfocal lenses was very good. The best acuity with correction was good for all patients The success rate of patients who did not need glasses was 6 % by <b>monofocal</b> lenses, however 72 % by multifocal lenses ReSTOR. By almost all cases of <b>monofocal</b> lense implants there was, as expected, a deficit in uncorrected near vision of Nieden 4 and 6. The examination of patients with multifocal lenses ReSTOR made of Acryl with asymmetrical distribution of light proves to be an effective lense, which allows patients, after having a cataract operation to live a “life without glasses. ” Patients who choose this lense type must then be willing to accept that there are some disadvantages, particularly with regards to contrast sensitivity, glare and a small reduction in visual acuity. So, currently, after appropriate consultation, the multifocal blue filter lenses with diffractive optic is considered to be an effective solution to lense replacement in cases of cataracts as well as refractive lense surgery...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{research}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} diffractive aspheric multifocal intraocular lens(MIOL) in the Uighur in phacoemulsification to provide guidance for the clinical treatment of cataracts patients in Xinjiang region. METHODS:Two hundred and twenty-eight Uygur patients(280 eyes) received phacoemulsification from April 2012 to March 2013 were randomly divided into multifocal group(106 cases with 146 eyes) and <b>monofocal</b> group(122 cases with 134 eyes). Patients were followed up for 3 mo. The intraocular pressure(IOP), uncorrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near vision, best-corrected distance visual acuity and best corrected near vision were measured. The delensed rate, visual quality, and satisfaction for lenses {{in the form of}} questionnaires were compared. RESULTS:Multifocal group was better on the uncorrected near vision than <b>monofocal</b> group(P P > 0. 05). The contrast sensitivity of multifocal group under scotopia at spatial frequency 3 c/d was lower than that of <b>monofocal</b> group(P P > 0. 05). Delensed rate of multifocal group was higher than that of <b>monofocal</b> group(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:MIOL with phacoemulsification can provide patient good full range vision, especially on good near vision. The patients with MIOL implanted have a higher delensed rate, less postoperative adverse symptoms, quicker recovery and satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} visual acuity and {{contrast}} sensitivity in {{eyes with the}} AcrySof ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) (Alcon) and eyes with the <b>monofocal</b> AcrySof SA 60 AT IOL. SETTING: Policlinico Umberto I, Department of Ophthalmology, Rome, and private clinical practice, Rome, Italy. METHODS: One hundred eyes had phacoemulsification cataract extraction and implantation of a ReSTOR multifocal OIL in the capsular bag. Inclusion criteria were corneal astigmatism less than 1. 5 diopters (D), myopia less than 4. 0 D, and no associated ocular disease. A complete ophthalmic examination, including uncorrected visual acuity, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity, was performed 6 months postoperatively. Results were compared with those in 40 eyes with the AcrySof <b>monofocal</b> IOL single-piece IOL. RESULTS: In the multifocal group, 90 eyes (90 %) had an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20 / 25 or better (logMAR < 0. 10) and an uncorrected near visual acuity at 35 cm of J 3 or better (logMAR 0. 14). The multifocal group and <b>monofocal</b> group had similar distance uncorrected and best corrected visual acuities; however, the multifocal group had significantly better near uncorrected acuity. The mean contrast sensitivity values were 18. 28 dB (static program) and 17. 95 dB (dynamic program) in the multifocal group and 19. 18 dB (static program) and 21. 2 dB (dynamic program) in the <b>monofocal</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: The ReSTOR multifocal IOL provided a satisfactory full range of vision; 92 % of the patients achieved total spectacle independence.

40|$|Purpose: To compare new-generation {{multifocal}} {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) with <b>monofocal</b> IOLs. Design: Randomized prospective clinical trial. Participants: Sixty-two consecutive patients with cataract, seen between January of 2005 and January of 2006 at the Department of Ophthalmology of Palermo University Hospital in Italy, were bilaterally implanted with <b>monofocal</b> (AR 40, Advanced Medical Optics [AMO], Santa Ana, CA; 15 patients), multifocal refractive (Array SA 40 N, AMO; 16 patients), multifocal refractive (ReZoom, AMO; 15 patients), or multifocal diffractive pupil-independent (Tecnis ZM 900, AMO; 16 patients) IOLs. Intervention: Bimanual phacoemulsification. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were far, near, and intermediate visual acuity of the 4 IOL-implanted groups. Secondary outcomes were defocusing curves, contrast sensitivity, patients' {{quality of life}} (7 -item visual function questionnaire [VF- 7], halos and glare presence, overall satisfaction), and spectacle independence. Snellen visual acuity was measured as uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA), best distance corrected near visual acuity (BDCNVA), best corrected near visual acuity (BCNVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA), and best distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (BDCIVA). Results: UCNVA was 20 / 50 in the <b>monofocal</b> IOL group, compared with 20 / 32 or better in the multifocal IOL groups (P< 0. 0005). The <b>monofocal</b> IOL group exhibited a lower BDCNVA than the multifocal IOL groups (P< 0. 0005). The diffractive multifocal IOL group performed better than either refractive group (P = 0. 007). UCIVA was significantly different (P = 0. 001) among the groups: <b>monofocal</b> (AR 40) 20 / 32; multifocal refractive (Array SA 40 N) 20 / 30; multifocal refractive (ReZoom) 20 / 25; and multifocal diffractive (Tecnis ZM 900) 20 / 30. Defocusing curves with - 3. 00 diopter lens exhibited a better trend in the diffractive group. The refractive multifocal IOL groups exhibited lower contrast sensitivities at 3 cycles/degree (P = 0. 038). The VF- 7 mean score was significantly lower in the <b>monofocal</b> than the multifocal IOL groups (P = 0. 002). Night halos were {{more common in the}} refractive groups (P< 0. 01).
