5|$|Parts of {{the company}} were {{subsequently}} sold off, such as the sale of Delrina's Electronic Forms Division to JetForm in September 1996.

25|$|Phonon is {{the name}} of the <b>multimedia</b> API in KDE4. Phonon is a {{different}} approach to <b>multimedia</b> backends than in previous versions of KDE. This is because Phonon only functions as a wrapper, abstracting the various <b>multimedia</b> frameworks available for Unix-like operating systems into runtime switchable backends that can be accessed through a single API. This was done to provide a stable API for KDE 4 and to prevent it from depending on a single <b>multimedia</b> framework. Applications that use the Phonon API can be switched between <b>multimedia</b> frameworks seamlessly by simply changing the backend used in System Settings. Nokia adopted Phonon for <b>multimedia</b> use in Qt4.4 and are developing backends for Gstreamer, Windows and OS X in the KDE SVN repository under the LGPL.|$|E

25|$|<b>Multimedia</b> {{advertising}} {{is the result}} of animation and graphic designs used to sell products or services. There are various forms of <b>multimedia</b> advertising through videos, online advertising and DVDs, CDs etc. These outlets afford companies the ability to increase their customer base through <b>multimedia</b> advertising. This is a necessary contribution to the marketing of the products and services. For instance, online {{advertising is}} a new wave example towards the use of <b>multimedia</b> in advertising that provides many benefits to the online companies and traditional corporations. New technologies today have brought on an evolution of <b>multimedia</b> in advertising and a shift from traditional techniques. The importance of <b>multimedia</b> advertising is significantly increased for companies in their effectiveness to market or sell products and services. Corporate advertising concerns itself with the idea that “Companies are likely to appeal to a broader audience and increase sales through search engine optimization, extensive keyword research, and strategic linking.” The concept behind the advertising platform can span across multiple mediums, yet, at its core, be centered around the same scheme.|$|E
