40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{correlate}} postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with histopathologic findings in brains of a series of autopsied patients with infantile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis, a recessively inherited progressive encephalopathy. Eight formalin-fixed brains (age range at death, 7 to 13 years) were examined with MRI. One patient had also undergone brain MRI 2 years before death. Histopathologic analyses were made from standard areas selected on the basis of the MRI scans. Postmortem MRI findings did not differ significantly from the findings in the patient who was also examined during life. Typical findings were extreme cerebral atrophy and hypointensity of the gray-matter structures in relation to the white matter on T 2 -weighted images, a pattern the reverse of normal. Characteristic histologic findings were almost complete loss of cortical neurons and secondary loss of axons and myelin sheaths in the white matter.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate host reaction to pericardial substitutes with and without incorporating slow heparin release. Methods: To avoid biologic variation among these pericardial patches, we made a composite of six membranes. The composite membrane consisted of epoxy-fixed patches with (1) or without (2) ionically bound heparin, a glutaraldehyde-fixed patch with (3) or without (4) ionically bound heparin, an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch (5), and a polyester polymeric patch (6). Ten recipient dogs weighing from 12 to 19 kg (mean 13. 6 kg) were used to assess the composite membranes as pericardial substitutes. The implanted composite membranes were retrieved 1 week (one dog), 2 weeks (one dog), 4 weeks (one dog), 8 weeks (one dog), and 12 weeks (six dogs) after implantation. Results: Overall, the synthetic patches had a more notable inflammatory reaction than the biologic patches with or without ionically bound heparin. The heparin-bound patches caused significantly less inflammation than their nonheparinized counterparts. The heparinized porcine patches cross-linked with different compounds were found to have less fibrous formation than the nonheparinized patches and the synthetic patches.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to {{investigate}} possible effects of biomaterials used to produce vascular grafts on the fibrinolytic system of endothelial cells. Therefore growth conditions for human umbilical vein endothelial cells on polytetrafluoroethylene and on polyurethane were optimized. Tissue culture polystyrene was used as a control material. We could demonstrate that precoating of the materials with fibronectin significantly increased the growth rate of human umbilical vein endothelial cells on these materials. Furthermore, we showed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on polytetrafluoroethylene or polyurethane released more plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 and tissue type-plasminogen activator into the conditioned media than did human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on polytetrafluoroethylene also deposited more plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 into the extracellular matrix than did control cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene. Our results give evidence that human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on two biomaterials used to construct vascular grafts, namely polytetrafluoroethylene and polyurethane, produce tissue-type plasminogen activator as well as plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, two major components of the fibrinolytic system also expressed by endothelial cells in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that endothelial cells grown on vascular grafts show functional integrity concerning their fibrinolytic system, which in turn might contribute to reduce the thrombogenic properties of the graft <b>material.</b> (<b>J</b> T HORAC C ARDIOVASC S URG 1995; 109 : 1059 - 65...|$|E

However, immunohistochemistry in human brain specimens is often compromised because of prolonged fixation. To select cell lineage–specific antibodies for quantitative studies of neurons and the major types of glia, we used 29 different antibodies, different epitope retrieval methods, and different detection systems to stain tissue arrays of formalin-fixed human brain. The screening pointed at CD 45 /leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD 68 (KP 1), 2 ′, 3 ′ cyclic nucleotide phosphatase (CNPase), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), HLA-DR, Ki 67, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), p 25 α-antigen, and S 100 β as candidates for future cell counting purposes, because these markers visualized specific neuronal and glial cell bodies. However, significant negative correlation between staining result and formalin fixation was observed by blinded scoring of staining for CD 45 /LCA, CNPase, GFAP, and NeuN in brain specimens fixed by immersion and stored up to 10 years in 4 % formalin solution at room temperature, independent of donor sex and postmortem interval. In contrast, improved preservation of NeuN and CNPase staining, and full preservation of GFAP and CD 45 /LCA staining in tissue fixed by perfusion and stored for up to 3 years in 0. 1 % paraformaldehyde solution at 4 C, indicated that immunohistochemistry can be performed in well-preserved biobank <b>material.</b> (<b>J</b> Histochem Cytochem 56 : 201 – 221, 2008...|$|E
30|$|At long {{distances}} (∼ 1 m to 10 m) {{from the fire}} front, the dominant component of the energy field is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 1.5 µm to 20 µm. This wavelength region is characteristic of radiators in the 1200 K to 1500 K maximum temperature range of flames from diffusion limited wildland fuel <b>material</b> (<b>J.</b> Cohen, Forest Service, personal communication). In recent laboratory and field experiments, the radiative fraction, {{that portion of the}} total energy released as electromagnetic radiation, was found to be in the range of 10 % to 30 % (Roberts et al. 2005; Smith and Wooster 2005; Wooster et al. 2005; Freeborn et al. 2008; R.L. Kremens, Rochester Institute of Technology, unpublished data). Although the radiative component of the fire energy field may not be the dominant mode of energy transport, it is certainly the most easily measurable, especially at long standoff distances, for example, using airborne or satellite remote sensing. Infrared (IR) radiation is also a direct physical measure (first order). Because long-wave IR penetrates smoke and can propagate over {{long distances}}, we will use this component of the fire energy field as a measurable analog for the entire energy field. This method is not without its drawbacks, however, because the radiative fraction may be a function {{of the nature of the}} fire (intensity, fuel moisture, etc.) and relating the radiated power to a parameter like fuel consumption may be problematic. More experiments are required to determine the radiative fraction as a function of fire type, fuel materials, and other combustion conditions.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (12 male, mean age 38. 1 years) were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study. Three-compartment wrist MR arthrographies were performed between October and December 2009 on a 3 T unit using a fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted isotropic high-resolution volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence in the coronal plane, with and without axial traction (3 kg). Two radiologists measured radiocarpal (radioscaphoid, radiolunate) and midcarpal (lunocapitate, hamatolunate) joint space widths, with and without traction, and assessed the amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces using a three-point scale: 0 = absence, 1 = partial, 2 = complete. RESULTS: With traction, joint space width increased significantly at the radioscaphoid (Delta = 0. 78 mm, P < 0. 01), radiolunate (Delta = 0. 18 mm, P < 0. 01), and lunocapitate (Delta = 0. 45 mm, P < 0. 01) spaces, and both observers detected significantly more contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. At the hamatolunate space, the differences in joint space width (Delta = 0. 14 mm, P = 0. 54) and amount of contrast material were not significant.

Studies were performed with a 3 Tesla (T) unit and included a three-dimensional isotropic fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence, without and with axial traction (4 kg).

They subsequently rated the amount of contrast material around the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex and between glenohumeral cartilage surfaces, using a three-point scale: 0 = no, 1 = partial, 2 = full. RESULTS: Under traction, the subacromial (Δ = 2. 0 mm, P = 0. 0003), superior (Δ = 0. 7 mm, P = 0. 0001) and inferior (Δ = 1. 4 mm, P = 0. 0006) glenohumeral joint space widths were all significantly increased, and both readers noted significantly more contrast material around the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex (P = 0. 014), and between the superior (P = 0. 001) and inferior (P = 0. 025) glenohumeral cartilage surfaces.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that the method of finite elements {{is one of the}} most attractive and efficient techniques regarding numerical solution - approximation - of partial differential equations. This method was initially introduced in 1943 by the mathematician Richard Courant, who suggested the use of piecewise linear approximation over triangular sub-domains, for second order functional using the direct variational method. It should be noted that Walter Ritz supplied the basis for the evolution of this method; he developed an approximation procedure for the solution of partial differential equation, which describes the bending of a square clamped plate. The variational formulation of the problem was used as a basis but using functions with global support. The Russian mathematician and engineer, Boris Grigorievich Galerkin, developed a relative but more general methodology. In the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, this method was developed and applied on practical engineering problems by John Argyris in England, as well as M. J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin and L. J. Topp in the United States. The method’s mathematical analysis was performed on a further level, and its general range as well as the wide field of possible application became immediately evident. In order to solve various problems of continuum mechanics a wide variety of FEM has been developed. Among which, the low order elements (bilinear interpolation functions) present a many advantages for linear, but mainly for non-linear dynamical problems. The most noteworthy disadvantages are the appearance of excessive energy, which leads to effectiveness and credibility deficiency. The aim of the present thesis is to develop a general, rational and reliable methodology of FEM for the solution of linear and geometrically non-linear problems, nearly incompressible <b>material,</b> <b>J</b> 2 -plastic flow (plane strain conditions) and plate bending problems. Moreover, the aim is to develop a rational methodology for the diagonalization of mass matrices, in order to deal with elastodynamic problems efficiently. The second chapter deals with the formulation of finite elements in the case of two-dimensional linear elastic problems. The objective of this chapter is to set forth, in a consistent manner, reasons for the appearance of excessive energy in the four-noded membrane quadrilateral element and to propose a formulation leading to simple and reliable elements that are less sensitive to distortions of the geometrical shape. By presenting the differential geometry, emphasis is placed upon those geometrical attributes which are inherently related to the quadrilateral. A modified version of the functional Hu-Washizu is employed for the discretization. Appropriate approximations for the displacements/rotations are chosen and the physical meaning of the various parameters is identified. A systematic procedure is followed for the approximation of stress and strain. The convergence of the formulation is investigated by examining the inf-sup condition and applying the patch test. Finally, results of numerical examples and comparisons with other elemental formulations are presented. ...|$|E

When i material {{is the same}} as <b>j</b> <b>material,</b> the repulsive interaction parameter is obtained from the dimensionless compressibility parameter (Equations 3 and 4). Moreover, when i and <b>j</b> <b>materials</b> are different, the repulsive interaction parameter is obtained from Equation 6 and Δa is obtained from the Flory-Huggins χ-parameter theory from MD simulation.|$|R

Multiple waves, traveling at different speeds and amplitudes, result when a projectile impacts on the water filling the annular space between the pipes. In the case of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic thin pipes we compute the wavespeeds, the fluid pressure and mechanical strains as functions of the fiber winding angle. This generalizes the single-pipe analysis of J. H. You, and K. Inaba, Fluid-structure interaction in water-filled pipes of anisotropic composite <b>materials,</b> <b>J.</b> Fl. Str. 36 (2013).

Cormery, An alternative 3 D model for damage induced anisotropy and unilateral effect in microcracked <b>materials,</b> <b>J.</b> Phys. IV 105 (2003) 329 13336). Built within a rigorous thermodynamic framework, the model uses a single scalar damage variable and accounts for the contribution of each set of parallel microcracks whether they are opened or closed. The consideration of unilateral effects allows to represent an anisotropic elastic behaviour induced by the closure of some microcracks and also the dissymmetric response in tension and compression which characterizes brittle materials...|$|R
