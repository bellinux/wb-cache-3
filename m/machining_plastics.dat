Prior work has concentrated on 2 -layer lenses individually machined from common low loss plastics. However, the aperture efficiency of these lenses has proven to fall off for large radii beyond about 20 wavelengths, and must be increased if this type of lens is to be used for applications such as satellite terminal antennas where upwards of 36 dBi gain is required.

40|$|Abstract—Plastic {{materials}} have good mechanical properties. Price {{and weight of}} plastic products are less as compared to metallic products. Therefore plastic is replacing to metals in various applications. Most of the plastic products are primarily produced by moulding process.

Turning, drilling and milling these are the machining operations mostly carried out in <b>plastic</b> <b>machining.</b> Study {{carried out in the}} field of <b>plastic</b> <b>machining</b> is discussed in this paper.

40|$|Hip {{prostheses}} used {{to fulfill}} injured or fractured limbs {{are made by}} <b>machining,</b> casting and <b>plastic</b> forming. <b>Machining</b> is {{the most commonly used}} one. However, there are many disadvantages such as high product cost in <b>machining.</b> <b>Plastic</b> forming methods provide more effective and durable implant production than machining. In this study, hip prosthesis with a complex geometry produced by forging were analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM). For this purpose, three-dimensional complex geometry was designed and then, FEM analyses were performed using MSC SIMUFACT 10 software. Factors affecting the production were defined as: temperature, friction coefficient and the pressing velocity. Stress distributions, temperature changes, die wears and punch forces applied to the die were examined. As a result of the study, the most suitable parameters were obtained as 500 °C, 0. 05 coefficient of friction and 2 mm/s die velocity. Also, the obtained FEM results were examined by regression analyses...|$|R
