His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate and strike rate.

5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much <b>more</b> <b>economical,</b> thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode.

Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled.

5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel <b>more</b> <b>economical.</b> In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies.
