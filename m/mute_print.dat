25|$|Only a {{year after}} <b>Mute</b> <b>Print,</b> the band {{released}} a second record on Nitro, again produced by Stevenson and Livermore. The record, entitled Ruiner, was released on August 16, 2005. Following stress from touring, founding member Jonathan Teves left the band, {{and was replaced by}} bassist Curtiss Lopez. They then embarked on their first European tour with Lagwagon, and also toured with Less Than Jake. Midway through the latter tour, Lopez abruptly quit the band. This left A Wilhelm Scream without a permanent bassist until Brian J. Robinson joined in April. The band continued to tour throughout 2006. They also released a 7-inch EP titled Diver on Jump Start Records. This was because the title track was recorded during the <b>Mute</b> <b>Print</b> sessions, but left off the album, and thus was not purchased by Nitro Records.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the band}} taking {{a more serious}} {{approach}} on Benefits, they decided to once more change their name, finally settling on A Wilhelm Scream. Signing with new label Jump Start Records, they re-released Benefits of Thinking Out Loud under their new name. After touring the United States and Canada a few times, they then began recording their next album, <b>Mute</b> <b>Print,</b> with Jump Start. For the recording of the album, the band decided to put [...] "as much shit as you can possibly fit into a song and pull off live" [...] into the songs, to which they attribute their faster, more aggressive and more technical sound. The album was produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, whom the band looked up to. Although the album was finished while the band was signed to Jump Start, {{the rights to the}} album were then bought by Nitro Records, who released it in 2004.|$|E
50|$|This {{album is}} the {{follow-up}} to a release {{that was done}} under their old name, Smackin' Isaiah, entitled Benefits Of Thinking Out Loud. Despite this, the previous album is most commonly known as an A Wilhelm Scream album, not a Smackin' Isaiah album, as it was reissued after the name change, with the new name of the artwork, before the release of <b>Mute</b> <b>Print.</b> Seeing as it was originally released under their old name, {{and that this was}} just a reissue, <b>Mute</b> <b>Print</b> is considered their first release as A Wilhelm Scream.|$|E
5000|$|It wasn’t until Tom Anderson, Reyn's Ala Moana store Assistant Manager, {{brought him}} Pat Dorian’s {{original}} [...] "reverse" [...] print shirt. Dorian was a charismatic bartender who would wear his signature line of [...] "aloha wear" [...] while serving drinks. In time, Tom Anderson got to talking with Dorian about offering his line at Reyn’s. Anderson wasn’t keen on Dorian's bright patterns {{and the two}} discussed <b>muting</b> the <b>print</b> by turning it inside out. In 1964, Spooner Kloth was born. Reyn Spooner began to grow and then decided to go international in 1974. The company started shipping Aloha apparel to Japan, Australia, Canada and other international locations.|$|R

50|$|In August/early September, The Vinyl Collective Cooperative Label {{released}} a vinyl version of <b>Mute</b> <b>Print.</b> The vinyl was printed in two colours, 333 black and 667 mustardy yellow. However, both unit holders {{and board members}} received {{a copy of the}} most limited version, only leaving 40 black ones for public sale.

50|$|Glorious Betsy is a 1928 silent {{film with}} talking sequences. It {{is based on}} a play of the same name by Rida Johnson Young and {{starring}} Dolores Costello. It was produced by Warner Bros. and was nominated for (but did not win) an Academy Award for Best Writing, Adaptation in 1929. The film was directed by Alan Crosland with cinematography by Hal Mohr. A <b>mute</b> <b>print</b> of this film survives in the Library of Congress, and while their copy of this film is missing some of the sound reels, it is unknown whether other copies of the sound have been preserved elsewhere.

50|$|The short {{was long}} {{believed}} to be a lost film, and its unavailability fueled the misconception that Jolson's first sound film was the famous feature-length milestone The Jazz Singer, which premiered almost exactly one year later. A <b>mute</b> <b>print</b> of A Plantation Act was eventually found in the Library of Congress, mislabeled as a preview for The Jazz Singer. A copy of the corresponding soundtrack disc also came to light, but it had been broken into four pieces and glued back together so imperfectly that it would not play through. After some careful surgery, restoration technicians succeeded in making a usable dub from the disc and digitally removing the pops and clicks resulting from the damage. The restored film was included on a LaserDisc published in the 1990s and as a bonus feature on the 2007 3-disc DVD release of The Jazz Singer.|$|E
