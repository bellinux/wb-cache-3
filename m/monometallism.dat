Although Veblen and Dewey {{did more}} to shape Mitchell’s outlook, Laughlin supervised his dissertation. Laughlin's main interest was in currency questions; {{he was a}} strong opponent of the quantity theory of money. The currency question facing the US in the 1890s was the choice between alternative monetary standards: inconvertible paper, gold <b>monometallism</b> and gold/silver bimetallism.|$|E

In 1840 {{he became}} {{librarian}} and in 1843 Secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, where {{he laid the}} foundation of the excellent system of commercial statistics for which Hamburg became noted. He published Denkschrift über Hamburgs Münzverhältnisse (1846) and subsequently numerous monographs and pamphlets, defending the cause of gold <b>monometallism.</b> Until his death he ranked as the leading defender of the single gold standard, the adoption of which by Germany was brought about largely through his efforts.

50|$|In the 19th century, {{there was}} a great deal of {{scholarly}} debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a gold or silver standard (<b>monometallism).</b> Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates. Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to Gresham's law, and that its replacement by a monometallic standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after technological progress and the South African and Klondike Gold Rushes increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 Nixon shock, since when all of the world's currencies have operated as more or less freely floating fiat money, unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to inconclusively debate the relative use of the metallic standards.|$|E
50|$|The State Theory of Money sets {{about to}} build a theory which could {{encompass}} indifferently monetary systems based on precious metals or paper money. Knapp's approach is naturalistic. As a theorist, {{he does not want}} to recommend what the monetary ought to be, nor does he explore how money could be put to use in order to attain certain goals. Drawing almost entirely on examples set in 19th century Europe, he derives from them a genetic and then a functional classification. In the process, the book reveals that some of what had been previously thought to be 'specie' money, was simply what he calls 'chartal hylogenic money'. An avowed Chartalist, Knapp does not advocate paper money pure and simple, he points out effectively that the Metallists with their theory cannot effectively explain some observed phenomena which they call 'anomalies'. To the contrary, Knapp thinks his theory is able to explain the manifold monetary systems mentioned in the book. Apart from its theoretical insights, the book is particularly interesting in that it is a very detailed source of information on 19th century European monetary history, focusing on the following countries: England, France, Holland, Austria and Germany. Due to a lack of financial means, the Royal Economic Society voluntary omitted the translation of Chapter IV which contains a historical review of England, France, Germany, Austria, and appendices containing specific case studies. All the same, even in its abridged English version The State Theory of Money depicts precisely the many changes which happened during the course of the 19th century: a general move from bimetallism to <b>monometallism,</b> the appearance and disappearance of paper money systems (in particular the Austrian one of 1866), the almost systematic use of paper money by the State in case of war alongside existing means of payment, the emergence of bank-notes and the use of Giro payments etc.|$|E

40|$|Bimetallism {{has been}} the subject of {{considerable}} debate: Was it a viable monetary system? Was it a desirable system? In our model, the (exogenous and stochastic) amount of each metal can be split between monetary uses to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint, and nonmonetary uses in which the stock of uncoined metal yields utility. The ratio of the monies in the cash-in-advance constraint is endogenous. Bimetallism is feasible: we find a continuum of steady states (in the certainty case) indexed by the constant exchange rate of the monies; we also prove existence for a range of fixed exchange rates in the stochastic version. Bimetallism does not appear desirable on a welfare basis: among steady states, we prove that welfare under <b>monometallism</b> is higher than under any bimetallic equilibrium. We compute welfare and the variance of the price level under a variety of regimes (bimetallism, <b>monometallism</b> with and without trade money) and find that bimetallism can significantly stabilize the price level, depending on the covariance between the shocks to the supplies of metals.

40|$|In {{the present}} article the nature and {{direction}} of the financial relations of legal regulation in the Russian Empire are described. Program notes of the finance ministers of {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century are analyzed, and on this basis the main areas of financial policy of the government is identified. It is emphasized that in the period of reforms in the Russian Empire a radical reform of the entire system of financial management was initiated. The Russian financial and economic policy in the second half of the nineteenth century was aimed at finding new and effective ways to overcome chronic financial crisis and budget deficits. As a principal mean of this policy still stood modernization of existing taxation system. Its reform in their base areas was based on the concepts and views that were expressed and formulated by the next minister of finance. As a result to achieve a certain stabilization of the financial system of the country became possible only in the early twentieth century after the conducted monetary reform by the Count Sergei Yulyevich Witte, the main principle of which was gold <b>monometallism.</b> But this reform did not also completely solve all financial problems of the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it became possible to achieve some financial stabilization, the result of which was the accelerated development of industry, commerce and agriculture. On the basis of the economic recovery in the Russian Empire a new system of social relations was formed, prerequisites for the development of civil society arose. But the revolutionary events of the year 1917 interrupted this economic take-off and put Russian empire to the brink of disaster, which occurred soon. This experience should be studied further...|$|E
