However, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary who knew them both, this rumour only spread {{after the death of}} Poniatowski, was generally disbelieved, and moreover, was circulated by Elżbieta herself, so the marriage is considered by <b>most</b> <b>to</b> be unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} Europe, was {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, it features a simplified interface with optional auto-aim and motion captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but <b>most</b> <b>to</b> accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E

However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for <b>most</b> <b>to</b> {{believe it to be}} true.

5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed <b>most</b> <b>to</b> the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of <b>most</b> <b>to</b> perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{textiles}} and related trades {{were the main}} source of employment in the town. Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25bleachers around Salford, <b>most</b> <b>to</b> the west of the township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other {{textiles and}} to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.|$|E
5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether <b>most</b> <b>to</b> admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain.

5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the <b>most</b> <b>to</b> innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E
