5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power <b>means</b> <b>that</b> the real {{income of the}} people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power <b>means</b> <b>that</b> domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

50|$|Action {{taken by}} {{unanimous}} consent {{does not necessarily}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it was taken by a unanimous vote (i.e. {{it does not necessarily}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> every member of the body would have voted in favor of the proposal). It may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> members feeling that it would be useless to oppose a matter would simply acquiesce.|$|R
5|$|Although motions in the {{scattered}} disc are random, they {{do tend to}} follow similar directions, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> SDOs can become trapped in temporary resonances with Neptune. Examples of resonant orbits within {{the scattered}} disc include 1:3, 2:7, 3:11, 5:22 and 4:79.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fame}} {{of the song}} <b>means</b> <b>that</b> {{it is one of}} the few things popularly {{associated}} with the island and it is evocative of island life, it was never sung by its residents, having been composed long after the evacuation.|$|E

60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we are always changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does <b>mean</b> (just now) <b>that</b> we are always changing the vision. It should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we are slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: it does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we are very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt it. Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we are always walking towards the New Jerusalem. It does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us. We are not altering the real to suit the ideal. We are altering the ideal: it is easier.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} earlier, prevailing {{and local}} winds are not spread evenly across the earth, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.|$|E
5|$|Automation <b>means</b> <b>that</b> {{the smaller}} size of parts permits a mobile {{inspection}} system to examine multiple parts more quickly. In addition to mounting inspection systems on automatic devices, multiple-axis robots can remove parts from the mould and position them for further processes.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock was inbred 3×4 to Pot-8-Os. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> the {{stallion}} appears once in {{the third}} generation and {{once in the}} fourth generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 3×4 to Highflyer, 4×4×4 to Herod and 4×4 to Eclipse.|$|E
60|$|Did this <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> her well-laid {{plan had}} failed? Or did it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> {{he was really}} {{changing}} his shoes and stockings? The last inference was the right one.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, rising, and {{gathering}} some strength from {{the sense of}} being on foot again. [...] "I don't <b>mean</b> <b>that.</b> I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> I don't--I can't consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And supposing it {{was your}} country's?" [...] he asked. [...] "Supposing they {{contained}} instructions to our Ambassador which you might consider inimical to your interests? Do you <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> you would look at home for the murderer? You <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> you have men so devoted to their native land that {{they were willing to}} run the risk of death by the hangman to aid her? You <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> your Secret Service is perfected to that extent, and that the scales of justice are held blindfolded? Or do you <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Scotland Yard would have its orders, and that these men would go free?" ...|$|R
5|$|By the {{definition}} of Minkowski addition, this last expression <b>means</b> <b>that</b> x = ∑qn for some selection of pointsqn in the convexhulls of the summand-sets, that is, where eachqn∈Conv(Qn). In this representation, {{the selection of the}} summand-pointsqn depends on the chosen sum-pointx.|$|E

5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of evolutionary biology (see straw man argument). This also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E
5000|$|Does it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> God's rest {{day began}} in 4026? It could have. The ... book {{does not say}} it did not ... You can accept it or reject it ...

Does it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Babylon the Great is going to go down by 1975? It could ... But we are not saying.|$|R
5000|$|As Stan Moore has written, [...] "Just because truth {{has been}} omitted, does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> truth is not true. Just because reality {{has not been}} perceived, does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it is not real." ...|$|R
5000|$|Glancing - Glancing {{can show}} a person's true desires. For instance, glancing at a door might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> {{someone wants to}} leave. Glancing at {{a glass of water}} might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> a person is thirsty.|$|R
5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity <b>means</b> <b>that</b> the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} as a {{boost for}} prostate cancer also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> the EBRT course can be shorter than when EBRT is used alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{combination}} with the unlimited use of internationally sourced Kyoto units, the allocation of New Zealand units to eligible emitters in proportion to their production <b>means</b> <b>that</b> there is no cap on total emissions within New Zealand.|$|E
6000|$|DAISY. [Suddenly distraught.] You don't <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> you're {{going to}} leave me? I didn't pay any {{attention}} to what you said. I thought it was just a mood. George, George, say <b>that</b> you don't <b>mean</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that there were a {{thousand}} things that this word might mean. It might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> she was already engaged to be married. It might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> she had vowed never to marry. It might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> she disapproved of such words at such a time. I cannot repeat the tenth of the meanings which I thought I might attach to this word. But the worst thing that it could purport, the most terrible signification of all, recurred to me over and over again. It might <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Bertha could not return my affection. She knew that I loved her, but she could not love me.|$|R
