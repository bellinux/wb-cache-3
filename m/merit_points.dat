40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this C-essay is to answer the question: What have been the {{consequences}} and effects of the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system on language studies and the parties concerned (teachers, students and principals) {{during the school year}} of 2010 / 11 ? The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system {{is the result of a}} political decision and was implicated for the first time in the Swedish upper secondary school during the school year 2010 / 2011. Being a completely new phenomenon it is of great interest and importance to study its effects. The study in this essay also aims to verify, falsify or nullify two hypotheses very often referred to in the political discussions regarding the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system: The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system will replace affection and interest as main reasons for language studies in upper secondary school and cause a rectification amongst the students choices of additional courses. The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system will have a segregating effect upon society and make it harder for people to rise in society through education in the future. A verification of these hypotheses would imply the appearance of an increased rectification amongst students as well as an orientation towards an in the future more segregated society. The empiric material has been collected and examined with qualitative as well as quantitative methods (questionnaires and interviews) and belongs epistemologically to the phenomenological and hermeneutical traditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} procurement {{evaluation method}} using lowest price conforming methods often causes some quality problems for  owners {{and increases the}} probability of dispute and delay during the contract execution. On the other hand, <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation method can provide quality assurance, but the procurement committees are often dificult to apply it, and to determaine mesurable criteria evaluation. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} a more in-depth study to find out the criteria evaluation for construction procurement. The research conducted in Bali, and adopted inductive qualitative approach involving 45 experts participated in construction procurements using <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation. Puposive sampling is applied to determine the respondents come from all actors included during procurement process. The data was collected through interviews, observation participant and questionnaires, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is choosed to analyse them. The result shows that : the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation for construction procurement can determine the contractor provides better quality than the lowest price conforming method when theevaluation criteria are clear, mesurable and transparant in the bidding document. There are two principle aspects that must be considered to assurethe quality that is: the technical aspect and the cost that weight consecutively 60 % and 40 %. The technical aspect comprises of : a) the existance of work plan (13. 51 %), comprising of construction methods (4. 12 %), supporting  equipment (4. 05 %), supporting material (3. 46 %), suporting workers (1. 88 %); b) competencies of human recources (19. 91 %), comprising of project management competencies(2. 31 %), existence of expert (7. 92 %) and certificated human resources (9. 68 %); c) existence of supporting equipments (15. 54 %) consisted of lifting support (4. 79 %), transportation support (6. 17 %), surveying support equipment(4. 58 %); d) the existing of time management (6. 30 %) consisted of network planning (4. 13 %), bar chart (1. 03 %), and S-curve (1. 14 %); and e) existence of quality assurance (2. 14 %) consisted of quality management system (1. 95 %), performance quality management (0. 66 %) and material management quality (2. 14 %).

This evaluation becomes a problem because it not balances in our real life interm of to get an excellent student in whole area in their involvement of curiculum and cocuriculum. To overcome this scenario, we designed a module for Student Idol to evaluate student through three categories which are academic, co-curiculum and leadership. All the categories have their own <b>merit</b> <b>point.</b> Using this method, student will be evaluated more accurate compared to the previously. So, teacher can easily evaluate their student without having any emotion factor, relation factor and others.
