5000|$|The {{spinning}} mule or <b>mule</b> <b>jenny</b> {{was created}} in 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It {{was a combination of}} Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the throstle frame or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.|$|E

50|$|The {{spinning}} jenny succeeded {{because it}} held {{more than one}} ball of yarn, making more yarn in a shorter time and reducing the overall cost. The spinning jenny {{would not have been}} such a success if the flying shuttle had not been invented and installed in textile factories. Its success was limited in that it required the rovings to be prepared on a wheel, and this was limited by the need to card by hand. It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810. The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning <b>mule.</b> The <b>jenny</b> was adapted for the process of slubbing, being the basis of the Slubbing Billy.|$|R
