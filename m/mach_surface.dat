The theory utilizes an integral representation of the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings equation in a fully linearized form. The asymptotic results are used for chordwise strips of the blade, while required spanwise integrations are performed numerically.

40|$|THE flowfield due to {{transverse}} {{injection of}} a round sonic jet into a supersonic flowis a configuration {{of interest in}} the design of supersonic combustors or thrust vector control of supersonic jets. The flow is also of fundamental interest because it presents separation from a smooth surface, embedded subsonic regions, curved shear layers, strong shocks, an unusual development of the injected jet into a kidney-shaped streamwise vortex pair, and a wake behind the jet. Although the geometry is simple, the flow is complex and is a good candidate for assessing the behavior of turbulence models for high-speed flow, beginning with the corresponding two-dimensional flow shown in Fig. 1. At the slot, an underexpanded sonic jet expands rapidly into the supersonic crossflow.

40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} the current limitation phenomenon of a low pressure arc discharge in mercury vapour. A new theory is presented which provides a theoretical relation between the D. C. current limit, I L and the independent discharge parameters of gas density p and tube radius r 0. This theory is {{based on the fact that}} arc existence is impossible for values of the lumped parameter (pr) less than a critical value. If at I = 0, p = p 0, where p 0 is such that (p 0 r 0) is above the critical value, then by increasing the current to a sufficiently high level (i. e. to I = I L) such a degree of neutral rarefaction is brought about (due to the high level of ionization) that the local p is lowered to the point where (pr) is equal to the critical value. Similarly a lower current limit is found, for as I is decreased, the wall sheath grows, effectively reducing r to such a point that (pr) reaches the critical value. Arc existence is only possible between these two limits. The upper and lower limit converge at a certain finite pressure, and below this, no arc existence is possible whatsoever. Proper experimental testing of such a theory, derived from fundamental relations, requires very careful control of the physical variables, especially local neutral density. Accordingly a special discharge tube, 5 metres in length, was constructed and the experimental results obtained therefrom were found to be in excellent agreement with the new theory. Theoretical predictions of the radial variation of neutral density for all values of I, were confirmed by experimental measurements of density using the absorption of resonance radiation. The case of constricted positive column geometry is considered, where a double sheath is formed at the diameter change. It is argued that if the double sheath is followed by a long uniform column, then the current limit I L, will be that of the smaller diameter tube, even though severe neutral depletion occurs near the double sheath. Experimental evidence is presented in confirmation of this prediction. Other aspects of the current limit theory are confirmed by Langmuir probe measurements and by heavy particle wall flux measurements using ionization gauges. These latter measurements also shed further light on the unresolved phenomenon of current-sustained pressure effects in the positive column. In the positive column at high currents, the neutral velocity distribution is found to be no longer Maxwellian (due to selective ionization of fast particles and of those with long flight paths) which leads to the unusual case of a non-Gaussian radiation absorption profile, although the only broadening influence is that due to the Doppler effect. The resultant profiles are computed and experimental results are presented which substantiate the calculations. The possibility of Hg sputtering by Hg ion bombardment of liquid Hg surfaces on the positive column walls is considered and a possible application to Hg valve technology is suggested. Measurements of metastable particle densities are presented and related calculations indicate the role of cumulative ionization in low pressure discharges. The Bohm sheath criterion for ions is generalized to include a number of complications, including that of oblique ion motion relative to the sheath edge. The plasma-sheath boundary is found to be mathematically equivalent to the <b>Mach</b> <b>surface</b> of fluid flow. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} subsonic inlet lip {{geometry}} on predicted <b>surface</b> and flow <b>Mach</b> number distributions is illustrated. The theoretical results {{were obtained from}} incompressible potential flow calculations corrected for compressibility. The major emphasis of this investigation is on the low-speed (takeoff and landing) operating conditions.

The low-speed results were obtained at both static conditions and a free-stream velocity of 42. 6 m/sec, with incidence angles ranging from 0 deg to 50 deg.

40|$|Comparisons between {{experimental}} and theoretical Mach number distributions and separation locations are presented for the internal surfaces of four different subsonic inlet geometries with exit diameters of 13. 97 centimeters. The free stream Mach number was held constant at 0. 127, the one-dimensional throat Mach number ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 71, and the incidence angle ranged from 0 deg to 50 deg. Generally good agreement {{was found between}} the theoretical and experimental <b>surface</b> <b>Mach</b> number distributions as long as no flow separation existed. At high incidence angles, where separation was obvious in the experimental data, the theory predicted separation on the lip. At lower incidence angles, the theoretical results indicated diffuser separation which was not obvious from the experimental <b>surface</b> <b>Mach</b> number distributions. As incidence angle was varied from 0 deg to 50 deg, the predicted separation location shifted from the diffuser region to the inlet highlight.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} study to investigate internal and external <b>surface</b> <b>Mach</b> numbers on several inlet geometries for possible application to the nacelle of the Quiet Clean Short-Haul Experimental Engine (QCSEE) are presented. The effects of external forebody geometry and internal lip geometry were illustrated at both low-speed and cruise conditions. Boundary-layer analyses were performed on several geometries to determine if lip flow separation might exist. The results indicated that inner-surface Mach number level and gradient could be reduced with inlets at a 50 deg incidence angle by blunting the external forebody geometry. The external Mach numbers at cruise conditions indicated that a compromise in the external forebody bluntness might be required to satisfy both low-speed and cruise conditions. For a fixed value of bluntness parameter, no lip flow separation was indicated for the 1. 46 - and 1. 57 -area-contraction-ratio inlets at low-speed conditions. However, a lip separation condition was obtained with the 1. 37 -contraction-ratio inlet. The QCSEE nacelle design takeoff operating condition (incidence angle of 50 deg and free-stream Mach number of 0. 12) resulted in higher peak <b>surface</b> <b>Mach</b> numbers than the design crosswind (incidence angle of 90 deg and free-stream Mach number of 0. 05) or static condition...|$|R
