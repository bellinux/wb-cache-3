50|$|A <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> is a room, building, or {{company where}} {{machining}} is done.

A <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> can be a small business (such as a job shop) or {{a portion of a}} factory, whether a toolroom or a production area for manufacturing. The parts produced can be the end product of the factory, to be sold to customers in the machine industry, the car industry, the aircraft industry, or others.

40|$|Abstract: Modelling and {{simulation}} {{technology is}} recognized for facilitating training, reducing production cost, improving product quality, and shortening development time. However, this technology remains largely underutilized by industry today. This is because custom simulator development {{is complex and}} costly, and custom translators are needed to run commercial simulation software. Information models and standard interfaces could help address these problems. A <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> information model, developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), provides data interfaces for integrating <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> software applications with simulation. The interfaces include organizations, calendars, work, resources, schedules, parts, process plans, and layout within a <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> environment. The model is represented by Extensible Markup Language and Unified Modelling Language.
