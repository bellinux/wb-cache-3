500|$|For diplexers {{dealing with}} {{contiguous}} passbands proper {{account of the}} crossover characteristics of filters needs {{to be considered in}} the design. [...] An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands. [...] Here a low-pass and a high-pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters. [...] The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband <b>multiplexers</b> and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of filters whose design objectives are {{something other than}} rejection or passing of certain frequencies. [...] Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. [...] However, a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes {{on the nature of}} a filter. [...] Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks, directional couplers, power dividers, power combiners, and diplexers.

500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as <b>multiplexers.</b> [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent.

500|$|Two widely spaced {{narrowband}} signals can be diplexed {{by joining}} together the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters. [...] Steps {{need to be}} taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance. [...] This can be achieved by appropriate spacing. [...] For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed λgb/4 from the junction where λgb is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. [...] Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed λga/4 from the junction. [...] This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa. [...] An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions. [...] A decoupling resonator is placed λg/4 from the junction of each filter.
