5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics.

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt.

Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while <b>medicine</b> <b>was</b> the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E

40|$|Substandard <b>medicines</b> <b>are</b> <b>medicines</b> {{which have}} failed to pass the quality {{measurements}} and standards set for them. 1 They should be distinguished from counterfeit (falsified) <b>medicines</b> which <b>are</b> deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled.

The 15 studies were all limited to antimicrobial drugs, with the majority (13) including antimalarials. Only 2 of the 15 studies within the systematic review differentiated between substandard and counterfeit medicines. Both studies involved antimalarial drugs in South East Asia.

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic <b>medicine</b> <b>was</b> {{that of a}} crisis, {{a point in the}} progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|As {{attention}} {{to the role of}} sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of resources available in print and on the internet.

5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects {{that had been}} taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even admit that they had these objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian <b>medicine</b> <b>was</b> a jailable offense.|$|E

Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units.
