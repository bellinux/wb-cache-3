5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest <b>market</b> <b>capitalisation,</b> the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by <b>market</b> <b>capitalisation.</b> According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E

5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the <b>market</b> <b>capitalisation</b> of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%.

A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E

They also sustain the emergence of collectives concerned with their effects – called their ‘milieu’ - which they become co-dependent upon. Such processes lead to iterative adjustments and developments that carry with them their own politics. While they sustain the emergence of political ends beyond those directly foregrounded by these instruments, they also prove to be very unevenly equipped to address emergent concerns...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's <b>market</b> <b>capitalisation</b> value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E

From {{the second half of}} the 19th century and continuing into the first half of the 20th century, Hong Kong operated as a key command centre for the allocation of Asian capital in its broadest form. Hong Kong stature as an International Financial centre (IFC), gradually developed from the 1950s to become a key component of the island's economy. It is an important centre for international finance and trade, with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region.

This study {{investigates the}} current private equity market in African {{frontier}} markets {{as well as}} inherent investment opportunities in these African frontier markets. The research includes an analysis of, inter-alia, the following: the development of capital markets in Africa, the classification of African frontier markets, the measurement of liquidity, the relationship between liquidity and asset prices {{and the history of}} private equity. This study will highlight to policymakers both in African and in donor capitals the need to implement strategies that will support investment (especially private equity investment) into the continent. The research carried out in this study should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} illiquidity risks of African frontier markets and show how these can be mitigated. This study will also provide key information on African frontier markets to investors and fund managers in order for them to understand that a typical investment strategy for investing in developed markets cannot be applied to frontier markets. The study analyses data of listed stocks on selected African stock exchanges and compares this to data for similar stocks listed on developed world stock markets to examine the relationship between liquidity, earnings multiples and <b>market</b> <b>capitalisations</b> for these stocks. Interestingly, results show that, while there is no relationship between the liquidity of stocks and the Price Earnings (PE) multiples of stocks, there is strong evidence to suggest that a relationship exists between the liquidity of stocks and the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiples of stocks. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that African frontier market stocks are significantly less liquid and have lower earnings multiples than stocks with similar <b>market</b> <b>capitalisations</b> listed on stock exchanges in the developed world...|$|R
40|$|We first analyse legal {{provisions}} relating to corporate transparency in Germany. We show {{that despite the}} new securities trading law (WpHG) of 1995, the practical efficacy of disclosure regulation is very low. On the one hand, the formation of business groups involving less regulated legal forms as intermediate layers can substantially reduce transparency. On the other hand, {{the implementation of the}} law is not practical and not very effective. We illustrate these arguments using several examples of WpHG filings. To illustrate the importance of transparency, we show next that German capital markets are dominated by few large firms accounting for most of the <b>market's</b> <b>capitalisation</b> and trading volume. Moreover, the concentration of control is very high. First, 85 % of all officially listed AGs have a dominant shareholder (controlling more than 25 % of the voting rights).

5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} {{takeover of the}} Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a market value of £3.3million, and J. Hey had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a <b>market</b> <b>capitalisation</b> of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. The takeover was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following the takeover, Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. The takeover saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E

Using extreme returns on daily stock market data from January 2004 till March 2013, we nd that transmission e ects are present for the tails of the returns distributions for the Pre-crisis, the US-crisis and the Euro-crisis periods from the Euro-periphery group to the Non-Euro and the Euro-core groups. Within group e ects are stronger in the crisis periods. We nd that the transmission channel {{does not seem to}} have intensi ed during the crisis periods, but it transmitted larger shocks (in some cases, extreme bottom returns doubled during the crisis periods). Thus, as extreme returns have become much more "extreme" during the nancial crisis periods, the expected losses on extreme return days have increased signi cantly. Given the fact that stock <b>market</b> <b>capitalisations</b> in these country groups are trillions of Euros, a 1 % or 2 % increase in extreme bottom returns (in crisis periods) can lead to aggregate losses of tens of billions Euros in one single trading day.

40|$|The {{past ten}} years have {{witnessed}} many changes in the Asian economies and stock markets, particularly in the Four Tigers, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They enjoyed economic growth well above the world average during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. There were sharp increases in their stock <b>market</b> <b>capitalisations</b> {{against the background of}} low growth and low interest rates in the US and European countries in the early 1990 s. This coincided with the time when measures to liberalise these markets were implemented to allow or attract foreign direct investments in their stock markets. Then by mid 1997, both their economies and stock markets began to slump. This ten year time period thus provides a good opportunity to examine how such economic and institutional changes affected the price and volatility behaviour of the Four Tigers and their relationships with other markets. Overall, the findings of the thesis suggest that with the increase in foreign participation in the four individual markets, the influence of noise trading activities has been reduced through more and better informed trading. However, their relationships with three world major markets, the US, the UK and Japan, are not getting much stronger. There is no evidence to suggest that their prices are being increasingly led by the world markets, nor is their volatility becoming more sensitive to foreign news. Their price and volatility relationships with three regional markets, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, were not particularly strong either, until recently, when the Asian financial crisis has made them more responsive to shocks from one another. The message to the governments of the Four Tigers is clear. Foreign direct equity investments have not destabilised their stock markets. Instead, the mismanagement of their own and/or their trading partners' economies should be held more responsible...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSThis study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} shar eprice predictability on the JSE Securities Exchange (JSE) over the 1989 to 2009 period. Th eoverall predictability of the JSE in terms of market indices and individual share prices is examined. The predictability in prices of portfolios formed by ranking shares according {{to a number of}} easily observable benchmarks is also investigated. Finally, the study identifies leading indicators of the returns of these ranked portfolios. Using a variance ratio test, the study finds little evidence to reject the hypothesis of uncorrelated increments in the JSA All Share Index or in the returns of individual shares. The study does, however, reject the hypothesis that returns of portfolios ranked according to market capitalization, dividend yield, earning yield, industry and trading volume are serially uncorrelated. Furthermore, the strong rejections of these hypotheses retain their statistical significance in the presence of heteroskedasticity in portfolio returns. In line with the results of previous research, the study finds that serial correlation in portfolios increases as the <b>markets</b> <b>capitalisation</b> and average trading volume of its constituents decrease. Portfolios containing high dividend and earnings yield shares are also found to have a high degree of serial correlation. When ranked according to the industry in which their constituents are classified, portfolios of industrial and retail shares show significant levels of serial correlation. Analyses of he load and lag characteristics of portfolios show that the returns of portfolios consisting of large capitalisation and well traded shares lead those consisting of small capitalisation and thinly traded shares. The economic and staistical significance of the results show a significant deviation from the commonly held view that the JSE is an efficient market. From {{the point of view of}} an investor seeking a potential avenue of excee return, the challenge lies in constructing a trading strategy and a portfolio with sufficient serial correlation to be robust to the costs incurred from frequent trading...|$|R
40|$|Restoration of Underwriting Profitability: While the {{financial}} loss reported by Lloyd‟s of London (Lloyd‟s, or “the Market”) at end- 2011 {{fell short of}} Fitch Ratings ‟ earnings expectations, the ability to absorb what {{has proved to be}} an unprecedented level of natural catastrophe losses has been demonstrated by the maintenance of the Market‟s capital strength. The agency expects a recovery in 2012 earnings, driven by a marked improvement in the underwriting result. Fitch forecasts a calendar-year combined ratio of c. 95 %. PMD’s Market Oversight: Fitch views the Performance Management Directorate‟s (PMD) oversight of Market participants as a key mechanism in improving earnings stability in the medium term. The agency will continue to monitor the influence of the PMD‟s efforts, paying particular attention to cycle management, improved long-term profitability and the performance of the market, which are the PMD‟s stated areas of emphasis. Mixed Performance Versus Peers: Considered {{in the context of the}} wider industry, technical performance has marginally outperformed the peer average, although the reported loss highlights the limited ability of Lloyd‟s to offset underwriting losses through other income streams. The agency will continue to assess the volatility of earnings at Lloyd‟s in relation to a range of European and Bermudian reinsurers that the agency considers to represent its closest peer group.
