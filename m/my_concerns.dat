500|$|A UGO Networks {{columnist}} {{was concerned}} that the expensive pilot {{would be hard to}} translate into weekly episodes, but [...] "after sitting down to watch Fringes second episode, [...] "The Same Old Story", <b>my</b> <b>concerns</b> have vanished. Fringes second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringes eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files is even better defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is 'condensed'. [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space." [...] Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Død Kalm". Zalben concluded that [...] "Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, I offered to be interviewed by her if she would answer <b>my</b> <b>concerns</b> about her previous writing about me. She has not responded to this offer." [...] MacDonald specifically named six points which he demands Beirich address before he grants her an interview, in a series of emails between himself and her, published on his website.|$|E

2500|$|After {{announcement}} of the planned rally, Brannon Howse, a professional organizer of Christian conferences, expressed wariness, stating [...] "The Apostle Paul warns Christians against uniting with unbelievers in spiritual endeavors. While I applaud and agree with many of Glenn Beck's conservative and constitutional views, that does not give me or any other Bible-believing Christian justification to compromise Biblical truth by spiritually joining Beck." [...] Breakpoint's Diane Singer said, [...] "If you're like me and believe [...] have been deceived into following another Jesus, then perhaps you share <b>my</b> <b>concerns.</b> I want real revival to come to America, which means it {{must be based on}} Truth, not deception."

2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All <b>my</b> <b>concerns</b> disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E
