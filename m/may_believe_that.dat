5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E
25|$|Many {{religions}} {{teach that}} sexual behavior {{outside of marriage}} is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught {{as a part of}} sex education. They <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on abstinence.|$|E
25|$|Consent may be {{complicated}} by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation. Verbalized 'no' to sex {{may be interpreted}} as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.|$|E

They <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{even though the}} victim {{initially}} resists them, that once they overpower their victim, the victim will eventually enjoy the rape. The rapist believes that the victim enjoyed what was done to them, and they may even ask the victim to meet them for a date later.|$|E
25|$|Lack of wet nurses: Wet {{nursing is}} illegal and stigmatized in some countries, {{and may not}} be available. It may also be {{socially}} unsupported, expensive, or health screening of wet nurses may not be available. The mother, her doctor, or family may not know that wet nursing is possible, or <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nursing by a relative or paid wet-nurse is unhygienic.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the fourth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, {{published}} in 1994 (DSM-IV), dysthymia is a serious state of chronic depression, which persists {{for at least two}} years (one year for children and adolescents). Dysthymia is less acute and severe than major depressive disorder. As dysthymia is a chronic disorder, sufferers may experience symptoms for many years before it is diagnosed, if diagnosis occurs at all. As a result, they <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> depression is a part of their character, so they may not even discuss their symptoms with doctors, family members or friends.|$|E

50|$|<b>May</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> psychotherapists {{towards the}} end of the 20th century had {{fractured}} away from the Jungian, Freudian and other influencing psychoanalytic thought and started creating their own 'gimmicks' causing a crisis within the world of psychotherapy. These gimmicks were said to put too much stock into the self where the real focus needed to be looking at 'man in the world'. To accomplish this, May pushed for the use of existential therapy over individually created techniques for psychotherapy.|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} having an older sibling, {{especially}} an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality. Girls with older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality {{and said they}} were less interested in seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with girls with no older siblings. Researchers believe this is because older siblings model gender roles, so girls with older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; girls with older brothers <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to societyâ€™s prescribed gender roles.|$|E
500|$|Patients: Many {{patients}} and families simply {{do not want to}} receive hospice care. The most common reason is an unwillingness to recognize when comfort rather than cure is a more realistic goal. When hospice is framed as care for when [...] "there is nothing left to do" [...] instead of a different kind of treatment, patients <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> choosing hospice is the equivalent of doing nothing.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} of Jesus' Passion, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances. The Passion narrative opens with {{an account of}} the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood. This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances, and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What is truth?, Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas. The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: [...] "that [...] <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditional anti-Mormons, {{according}} to Peterson, {{are those who}} [...] "are content to argue that Mormonism is untrue" [...] and [...] "incompatible with the Bible." [...] While some <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Satan was indirectly involved in {{the founding of the}} LDS Church, they place little emphasis on his role. For them, naturalistic and historical explanations are always preferable to supernatural ones.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{subjects}} {{almost always}} provide informed consent {{for their participation}} in an RCT, studies since 1982 have documented that RCT subjects <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally; that is, {{they do not understand}} the difference between research and treatment.

Other Oxfordians say that de Vere's extant work is that of a young man and should be considered juvenilia, while <b>May</b> <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> all the evidence dates his surviving work to his early 20s and later.|$|R

2500|$|Protagoras is {{credited}} with the philosophy of relativism, which he discusses in his work, Truth (also known as Refutations). Although knowledge of his work is limited, discussion of Protagoras' relativism is based {{on one of his}} most famous statements: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: {{of the things that are}}, that they are, of the things that are not, that they are not." [...] By this, Protagoras meant that each individual is the measure of how things are perceived by that individual. Therefore, things are, or are not, true according to how the individual perceives them. For example, Person X <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the weather is cold, whereas Person Y <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the weather is hot. According to the philosophy of Protagoras, there is no absolute evaluation of the nature of a temperature because the evaluation will be relative to who is perceiving it. Therefore, to Person X, the weather is cold, whereas to Person Y, the weather is hot. This philosophy implies that there are no absolute [...] "truths". The truth, according to Protagoras, is relative, and differs according to each individual.|$|E
2500|$|The message confuses {{people for}} several reasons. The {{abbreviation}} [...] "PC" [...] may mislead {{because it is}} widely understood â€” especially {{in the context of}} electronic office equipment â€” to mean [...] "personal computer", suggesting to many that the problem lies in the computer, not the printer. The word [...] "LOAD" [...] is also ambiguous, as it can also refer to the transfer of electronic data between disk and memory. Furthermore, the word [...] "LETTER" [...] is associated with paper size only in the US, Canada and some Latin American countries; A4 is the standard size used {{in the rest of the}} world. Thus, users encountering this message <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they are being instructed to transfer the data or content of their typed letter (as in correspondence) to the printer, even though they have already sent the job to the printer.|$|E

Receiving the Eucharist is {{a central part of}} the {{religious}} life of Catholic and Orthodox Christians. Most Protestant traditions do not share the belief in the Real Presence but otherwise are varied, for example, they <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in the bread and wine, Christ is present only spiritually, not {{in the sense of a}} change in substance (Methodism) or that the bread and wine of communion are a merely symbolic reminder (Baptist).
