500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was above}} all {{influenced}} by Odd Man Out (1947) - [...] "I still {{consider it as}} one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is true {{that the}} music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the {{so-called}} difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have noticed, as we have held our ground, {{that there has been a}} softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear Rachel, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> candidly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think Gerald's future {{considerably}} {{more important than}} your past.|$|R
60|$|PURDIE (finely). <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> Mabel, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{a little}} {{disappointed}} in you. <b>I</b> certainly understood <b>that</b> you had gone upstairs to put on your boots.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A very {{different}} thing!' said Sol vehemently. 'Though he is your brother, sir, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> this, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would rather she married the poorest man I know.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg talked {{openly about}} his {{connections}} with communism and {{his admiration for}} past communist heroes and the labor movement {{at a time when}} the Red Scare and McCarthyism were still raging. He admired Fidel Castro and many other quasi-Marxist figures from the 20th century. In [...] "America" [...] (1956), Ginsberg writes: [...] "America, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry". Biographer Jonah Raskin has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held [...] "his own idiosyncratic version of communism". On the other hand, when Donald Manes, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: [...] "I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government or any government by violence. ... I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed".|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> openly, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot {{see what}} {{the story of the}} {{penitent}} thief {{has to do with a}} death-bed repentance; and for this plain reason, that the penitent thief did not die in his bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] Rochester remarked drily. [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> Mary, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{gave you}} credit for greater perspicuity. The man is an intriguer. Naturally, {{he was only}} too anxious to be of service to so charming a lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not call}} me Lady Anna, or I shall not like you. I will tell you, but you <b>must</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> told you. Only I thought {{everybody}} knew. I told Lord Lovel, and he, I think, has told all the world. It is Mr. Daniel Thwaite." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{surprised}} beyond measure at his appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, Mr Gresham, {{if you ask}} me, I <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{think you}} should abstain from any {{intercourse}} with Dr Thorne whatever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Really, George,' remonstrated Miss Lavinia, 'I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't {{understand}} your allusions, and that I {{think you might}} be more delicate and less personal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But Isabel {{challenged}} {{this assertion}} {{with a good}} deal of seriousness. [...] "You <b>must</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> Lily. <b>I</b> don't feel grand at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{coming to}} be very VERY kind to you, and you <b>must</b> let me <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> greatly hope you'll not be less so to herself." ...|$|R
60|$|Look at the {{influence}} of a mere play of physiognomy! If you remember {{what we were talking about}} you will hardly believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> caught myself grinning down at that demure little girl. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> too <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt more friendly to her at the moment than ever before.|$|R
60|$|Jack. Well, really, Gwendolen, I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{think there}} are lots of other much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't {{like the}} job," [...] said Patsy, the next morning, {{as she stood}} by the window and faced Beth and Kenneth. [...] "Suppose we fail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Mr. Robarts, but I cannot {{allow that}} {{assertion}} to pass unquestioned. I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have adequate cause for believing {{that he came}} here by his lordship's authority." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think he}} might. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> this: <b>that,</b> had <b>I</b> {{known at the}} time the cause of the fray, I should have refused to {{accompany}} him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like those}} people. If Thomas Gordon {{had been a}} man like Robert Williamson I shouldn't have waited to see your Kilmeny. But they are all right--rugged and grim, but of good stock and pith--native {{refinement}} and strong character. But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> candidly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope your young lady hasn't got her aunt's mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's my own Frank. What I said to mamma, I {{said because}} I thought it right; but you <b>must</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a Puritan. I would do {{anything}} {{in my power to}} make your holidays bright and pleasant. <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> boys require so much more to amuse them than girls do. Good night, dearest; pray don't overdo yourself with work, and do take care of your eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, Terence. I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was afraid}} {{that we should not}} be moving until the spring. Shall we go in and say goodbye to our fellows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We always disliked each other, Vernon, but I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{never thought}} a day would come when you {{proposed}} to murder {{me in my}} own camp," [...] said Aylward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, aunt, I do. I {{should be}} wrong to marry a man that I do not love; {{and as for the}} money, aunt, I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think you are mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear, dear!' thought he, 'can I be stupid? I {{have never}} thought that, and nobody must know it! Can I be not fit for my office? No, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{certainly}} not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot see the cloth!' ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{called to}} mind since, the address, the management, the {{compliance}} in show, {{and in general}} the whole conduct of the queen-mother with the mutinous people of Lyons, and compared it with the conduct of my unhappy master the King of England, I could not but see that the queen understood much better than King Charles the management of politics and the clamours of the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can soon do that," [...] I answered; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> first <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{believe you}} will suffocate {{if you try}} to talk from under that {{cavernous}} bonnet. Why don't you take it off, and get the good of this cool shade? You had discarded all that sort of thing when I last talked with you, and you were then just as much a Mother Superior as you are now." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was no {{help for}} her, and the terrible word must be spoken. [...] "She has left her {{property}} to Captain Aylmer, papa; and I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{think she is}} right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Germany {{has changed}} very much since I was {{here as a}} boy," [...] he confessed. [...] "One has heard of the growing wealth of Berlin, but I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} expected--" ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, Mary dear, I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like my Carton, and I have a faint idea {{sometimes}} that if I had acted him, I {{could have done}} something with his life and death.|$|E
60|$|We were so {{filled with}} admiration of Jack's {{magnificent}} beard and moustache, <b>that</b> Peterkin and <b>I</b> had resolved to cultivate ours while in Africa; but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> as <b>I</b> looked at Peterkin's face, the additional hair was not at that time an improvement, and <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> much more {{could not have been}} said for myself. The effect on my little comrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise good-looking face to appear extremely dirty.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{and will}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never yet knew Alaric <b>say</b> a word <b>that</b> was not true; and, which is more, I am {{quite sure that}} he would not accuse you of {{falsehood}} behind your back in a fit of jealousy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not like}} to seem inhospitable, Anna," [...] she said hesitatingly. [...] "And of course you are my niece just as Annabel is, {{although}} I am sorry to learn that your conduct has been much less discreet than hers. But at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think your presence here just now would be a great misfortune. I wish very much that you had written before leaving Paris." ...|$|R
