5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathy</b> might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial diseases, defined restrictively as {{disorders}} due to defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, {{are notoriously}} heterogeneous, both clinically and genetically. Here, we review only disorders affecting exclusively or predominantly skeletal muscle (<b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies).</b> As the respiratory chain is under dual genetic control, we consider first myopathies due to defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), distinguishing those due to defects of mitochondrial protein synthesis in toto from those due to mutations in proteinencoding genes. We then divide disorders due to nuclear gene defects into six groups and discuss <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> due to genetic defects affecting: respiratory chain components; the protein importation machinery; the inner membrane lipid milieu; and intergenomic signaling.

Muscle phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of adenosine diphosphate recovery after exercise improved by more than 60 %. Fatigue and tolerance to daily activities also improved.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> are {{regulated}} by two genomes: the nuclear DNA, and the mitochondrial DNA. While, so far, most studies {{have dealt with}} <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> due to deletions or point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, a new field of investigation is that of syndromes due to mutations in the nuclear DNA. These latter disorders have mendelian inheritance. RESULTS: Three representative cases have been selected: one with COX deficiency and a Leigh syndrome due to a SURF 1 gene mutation, one due to a defect of Coenzyme Q synthesis and one with dominant optic atrophy due to a mutation in the OPA 1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Future developments will show that many neurodegenerative disorders are due to mutations of nuclear genes controlling mitochondrial function, fusion and fission...|$|R
2500|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} are sometimes (about 15% of the time) caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondrial function.

40|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> are a {{group of}} diverse neuromuscular disorders. Defects in {{electron}} transport chain (ETC) subunits have been implicated in pediatric and adult onset cases. Skin fibroblasts from four patients were studied to elucidate the biochemical defects. Cells from two patients with ETC complex I deficiency, showed reduced oxidation of alanine with normal oxidation of succinate. Analysis of complex I subunits indicated deficient synthesis of the 20 kDa subunit in the severely affected patient. In the milder patient, subunit abnormalities were not detected. Fibroblasts from a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), showed reduced oxidation of alanine and succinate through the ETC.

40|$|Cardiac {{involvement}} {{in patients with}} inherited myopathies is well described in the literature. In dystrophinopathies (Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD], Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD], and DMD/BMD carriers), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) {{has been reported in}} association with muscular dystrophy. In addition, in cases with particularly mild skeletal muscle involvement, 3 cardiomyopathy may be the primary clinical feature and the main clinical problem. In <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies,</b> cardiac conduction defects have been described in many patients, whereas both hypertrophic (HCM) and DCM have been reported infrequently. In desminopathies, cardiomyopathy with conduction abnormalities is frequently associated with myopathy and may predominate. 9 Up to now, end-stage cardiomyopathy resulting from dystrophinopathies, desminopathies, and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> have been accepted for heart transplantation (HTx) with reluctance because of a high perioperative risk caused by physical disability and restrictive respiratory failure. Moreover, a suspected rapid onset of cardiomyopathy of the transplanted heart is a further concern. 10 Here we report five cases of end-stage cardiomyopathy with mild to moderate myopathies, who successfully underwent heart transplantation and were followed up for 72 months after surgery...|$|R

5000|$|Rare but severe {{diseases}} such as <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> are associated with dysfunctional human ADP/ATP translocase. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>myopathies</b> (MM) refer {{to a group of}} clinically and biochemically heterogeneous disorders that share common features of major mitochondrial structural abnormalities in skeletal muscle. The major morphological hallmark of MM is ragged, red fibers containing peripheral and intermyofibrillar accumulations of abnormal mitochondria. [...] In particular, autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) is a common disorder associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase and can induce paralysis of muscles responsible for eye movements. General symptoms are not limited to the eyes and can include exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, hearing deficit, and more. adPEO shows Mendelian inheritance patterns but is characterized by large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. mtDNA contains few introns, or non-coding regions of DNA, which increases the likelihood of deleterious mutations. Thus, any modification of ADP/ATP translocase mtDNA can lead to a dysfunctional transporter, particularly residues involved in the binding pocket which will compromise translocase efficacy. MM is commonly associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase, but MM can be induced through many different mitochondrial abnormalities.|$|R
