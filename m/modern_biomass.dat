In this paper we assess the impacts of large-scale global utilization of biomass on regional and grid scale land cover, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon cycle. We have implemented in the global environmental change model IMAGE the LESS biomass intensive scenario, which was developed for the Second Assessment Report of IPCC. This scenario illustrates the potential for reducing energy related emission by different sets of fuel mixes and a higher energy efficiency. Our analysis especially covers different consequences involved with such <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> scenarios. We emphasize influences of CO 2 concentrations and climate change on biomass crop yield, land use, competition between food and biomass crops, and the different interregional trade patterns for <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> based energy. Our simulations show that the original LESS scenario is rather optimistic on the land requirements for large-scale biomass plantations. Our simulations show that 797 Mha is required while the original LESS scenario is based on 550 Mha. Such expansion of agricultural land will influence deforestation patterns and have significant consequences for environmental issues, such as biodiversity. Altering <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> requirements and the locations where they are grown in the scenario shows that the outcome is sensitive for regional emissions and feedbacks in the C cycle and that competition between food and <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> can be significant, We conclude that the cultivation of targe quantities of <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> is feasible, but that its effectiveness to reduce {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} has to he evaluated in combination with many other environmental land use and soclo-economic factors.

40|$|We {{have been}} living in the anthropocene era since about 1950, and {{evidence}} of human influence on the natural ecosystems and climate is mounting. Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to reduce the effects of climate change in the future. In an integrated assessment with the IMAGE model (integrated model to assess the global environment) the effect of methane reductions has been analysed. Reductions were calculated against baseline scenarios P and Q. Scenario P describes a prosperous world with an economic growth of 3 % per year and a relatively low population outlook, resulting in a population peak in 2050 with 8. 7 billion people and a reduction to 7. 1 billion in 2100.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{show that}} the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) of the common tree taxa {{is directly related to}} the biomass and, by inference, to the population size of the taxa around the study site. Fossil PAR records preserved in lakes provide therefore a potential proxy for quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. We use the high-resolution PAR records obtained from two accurately dated lake sediment cores in Finland to generate quantitative Holocene biomass records for Pinus, Picea and Betula, the most common tree taxa of the European Boreal forest. PAR values were calibrated to biomass values by comparing the modern PAR values with the <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> values and assuming a linear relationship between the past PAR and biomass values. The obtained PAR and biomass values and trends are remarkably coherent between the two records. Pinus has a stable Holocene biomass size and its <b>modern</b> <b>biomass,</b> about 20 t/ha corresponds with the natural Pinus biomass in the study regions. In contrast, Picea immigrated from the East during the mid Holocene, had a maximum biomass, 50 - 60 t/ha, at 3500 - 1000 cal. yr BP, and declined strongly during the last 1500 - 1000 years as a result of increased human activity and related rise of fire frequency. Thus, the modern Picea biomass in the study regions, about 22 t/ha, is only 35 - 40 % of the natural Picea biomass. The results of this pilot study demonstrate the potential of the calibrated PAR data in quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. Such reconstructions can provide fresh insights into the structure of past plant communities and, when combined with records reflecting palaeoclimates, natural disturbances, and human activity, can help to disentangle the long-term importance of different enviromental drivers to changes in plants populations and ecosystems...|$|E

River dynamics is mainly determined by the seasonal variation of weather conditions and, together with the nature of the catchment and land management, affects flow patterns on a local scale.

In order to investigate emission factors for particulate emissions and the chemical compositions of the PM emissions over typical whole day operation cycles, a project on the determination and characterisation of PM emissions from the most relevant small-scale biomass combustion systems was performed at the BIOENERGY 2020 + GmbH, Graz, Austria, in cooperation with the Institute for Process and Particle Engineering, Graz University of Technology. The project was based on test stand measurements, during which relevant operation parameters (gaseous emissions, boiler load, flue gas temperature, combustion chamber temperature etc.) as well as PM emissions have been measured and PM samples have been taken and forwarded to chemical analyses. Firstly, typical whole day operation cycles for residential biomass combustion systems were specified for the test runs. Thereby automatically fed and automatically controlled boilers, manually fed and automatically controlled boilers as well as manually fed stoves were distinguished. The results show a clear correlation between the gaseous emissions (CO and OGC) and the PM 1 emissions. It is indicated that <b>modern</b> <b>biomass</b> combustion systems emit significantly less gaseous and PM emissions than older technologies (up to a factor of 100). Moreover, automatically fed systems emit much less gaseous and PM emissions than manually fed batch-combustion systems.

Paleofire records also provide insights into the causes and impacts of past wildfires and emissions when analyzed in conjunction with other paleoenvironmental data and with fire models. Here we present new 1000 -year and 22   000 -year trends and gridded biomass burning reconstructions based on the Global Charcoal Database version 3 (GCDv 3), which includes 736 charcoal records (57 more than in version 2). The new gridded reconstructions reveal the spatial patterns underlying the temporal trends in the data, allowing insights into likely controls on biomass burning at regional to global scales. In the most recent few decades, biomass burning has sharply increased in both hemispheres but especially in the north, where charcoal fluxes are now higher than at any other time during the past 22   000 years. We also discuss methodological issues relevant to data–model comparisons and identify areas for future research. Spatially gridded versions of the global data set from GCDv 3 are provided to facilitate comparison with and validation of global fire simulations...|$|R

In order to reach climate targets and create low-carbon economies, biomass is expected to play a pivotal role. While the future resource potential of biomass may be significant and the global trade of bioenergy is rapidly expanding, biomass is currently only playing a minor role in the global energy supply. Total biomass primary energy supply was 51 EJ in 2008, of which more than 60 % constituted for traditional use such as cooking and heating in developing countries (India and sub-Saharan Africa) [1]. The main applications of <b>modern</b> use of <b>biomass</b> are today firstly, in the industrial sector to produce process steam, and secondly, in the power sector. Major drivers {{for the growth of}} bioenergy are the large resources potential and low production costs of biomass in export countries such as Brazil and Canada, high fossil fuel prices, and a variety of policy incentives to stimulate biomass use in import countries. Recent evaluations of the biomass resource potential show that biomass could in a sustainable manner contribute with as much as 160 - 270 EJ to the world’s primary energy supply by 2050 [2]. However, a number of barriers need to be overcome before such a potential could be realized. One of the main obstacles is that large biomas...|$|R
