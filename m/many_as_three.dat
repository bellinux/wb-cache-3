At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders. They {{may be used}} in conjunction with other side mounted stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E

5|$|The Edmontonian land {{vertebrate}} age {{is defined}} by the first appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record. Although sometimes reported as of exclusively early Maastrichtian age, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was of somewhat longer duration. Deposition began approximately 73million years ago, in the late Campanian, and ended between 68.0 and 67.6million years ago. Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top. As <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> quarters of the dinosaur specimens from badlands near Drumheller, Alberta may pertain to Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily. When available, tamarind makes {{up as much as}} 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three,</b> played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, {{returning to the}} touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E

The particular Siberian twist {{when it came to}} livestock, however, was the amount of domesticated reindeer in the area, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 250,000 in the mid-19th century.|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians are {{generally}} polygynous, and individual males try {{to mate with}} as many females as they can. Monogamous pairings have been recorded in American alligators. Dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories which contain several females. Males of some species, like the American alligator, try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays. During courtship, crocodilian males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Copulation typically occurs in the water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail submerge. The male rubs across the female's neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs, placing his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Mating can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously submerge and surface. While dominant males usually monopolise reproductive females, multiple paternity is known to exist in American alligators, where as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> different males may sire offspring in a single clutch. Within a month of mating, the female crocodilian begins to make a nest.|$|E
5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E

However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E
40|$|The old songs {{performed}} in the ages of Zui and To consist of the ceremonial music at the festival of the court, the songs which had been sung {{since the age of}} Gi and imported to Buntei of Zui by Kada, the songs in the court of Nancho since Toshin, and the songs of Koto, a Japnese harp, prevalent among the people since the ages of Kan and Gi. Buntei of Zui set a high value on the moralistic ceremonial music exclusively, but Yodai favored all kinds of songs and employed so many singers with no restriction that there were more than thirty thousand of them at the Gaku-fu of f the court. This is a very extraordinary thing in the history of Ghinese music. In the age of To, Koso, Taiso and Koso loved the old songs so much that <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> sixty <b>three</b> old songs were in fashion in the court. Since the Choan era of Sokutenbugo, they became out of fashion at last, being outrivaled by the foreign music. The Koto songs alone, however, which numbered <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> eighty <b>three,</b> were performed among the people and retained their life for about four hundred and fifty years, and these facts can be affirmed through the study of Kesse-kichoyuran and Kinreki which contain the list of the titles of these Koto songs...|$|R

5|$|At {{the head}} of the temple {{hierarchy}} was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>three</b> grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies. While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts {{over the course of the}} year. Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists. Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the lector priest who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen. Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs. In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought asylum within the precinct, or recluses who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household. A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests, with tens of thousands of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country. These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.|$|E
