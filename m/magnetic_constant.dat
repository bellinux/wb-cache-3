40|$|We {{perform a}} {{systematic}} examination on {{the dependence of}} the calculated nuclear <b>magnetic</b> shielding <b>constants</b> on the chosen geometry for a selective set of density functional methods of B 3 LYP, PBE 0, and OPBE. We find that the OPBE exchange-correlation functional performs remarkably well when either the optimized geometries or the experimental geometries are used. The popular B 3 LYP and PBE 0 functionals have a clear tendency of deshielding, giving shieldings that are usually too low and shifts that are usually too high, at the experimental geometries. Combined with the Hartree-Fock geometries, however, much improved <b>magnetic</b> <b>constants</b> are obtained for B 3 LYP and PBE 0, due to the compensation effect from the systematic Underestimation of bond lengths by the Hartree-Fock method.
