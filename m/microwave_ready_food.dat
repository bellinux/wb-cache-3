5000|$|Instant rice, {{also known}} as minute rice, is rice that has been precooked. Some types are <b>microwave</b> <b>ready.</b> Some types are {{dehydrated}} so that it cooks more rapidly. Regular rice requires 18-30 minutes to cook while instant rice needs anywhere between 1-7 minutes. Because {{it has already been}} cooked, all that is necessary to prepare instant rice is to simply re-hydrate it with hot water.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{preliminary}} and exploratory study on mother's attitudes and behaviour towards infant feeding in Poland. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the impact of demographic and socio-economic factors on mother's choice of breastfeeding and attitude towards baby <b>ready</b> <b>food.</b> Primary cross-sectional data were gathered through a sample survey research. The choice for breastfeeding is found to be associated with lower income, whereas no significant effects of mother age and education are observed. With respect to attitude towards baby <b>ready</b> <b>foods,</b> younger mothers were found to attach significantly more importance to advertising and information on the product label. They also rely more on specialised information from paediatricians with respect to infant feeding. Generally, the findings point towards a greater need for information related to infant feeding among younger and economically less-favoured mothers...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the quality of smoked Hilsa fish (Tenualosa ilisha). The fishes were grouped into three parts. One part contains 10 % salt, 10 % garlic and 10 % coriander and treated as Treatment 1 (T- 1). Another named was Treatment 2 (T- 2) and contained 10 % salt and 10 % garlic. The other parts contained 10 % salt only and treated as Treatment 3 (T- 3) to evaluate the quality of the smoked Hilsa with these ingredients for preparing a <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> item. All three treatments were found microbiologically acceptable since indicator organisms and Salmonella were not detected. However, from the results of overall acceptability, taste, colour and texture of the products, Treatment 2 had the best acceptance and significantly different when compared to the other treatments and selected the item as a quick but <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> item in laboratory condition. The moisture content, protein content, fat content, ash content, total volatile nitrogen and salt content of treatment 2 were found 39. 65 ± 0. 19, 25. 65 ± 0. 17, 24. 85 ± 0. 17, 3. 50 ± 0. 30, 2. 55 ± 0. 22 and 16. 20 ± 0. 14, respectively.

In the olden days, the dwellings of the Veddas consisted of caves and rock shelters. Today, they live in unpretentious huts of wattle, daub and thatch.|$|R
5000|$|The goat {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{domestic}}ated creatures, yet readily goes feral and does quite well on its own. Sheep are close contemporaries and cohorts of goats in the history of domestication, but the domestic sheep is quite vulnerable to predation and injury, and thus rarely seen in a feral state. However, in places where there are few predators, they get on well, for example in the case of the Soay sheep. Both goats and sheep were sometimes intentionally released and allowed to go feral on island waypoints frequented by mariners, to serve as a <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> source.|$|R

50|$|L. riparia are generalist predators whose diet {{consists}} {{entirely of}} insects, or scavenged meat. They have a preference to Lepidoptera larvae and insect eggs, but will eat any available insect. Because of their flexible eating habits, they easily adapt to any habit {{as long as}} there are insect around. In absence of a <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> supply, they have been known to eat nymphs and eggs of their own species. As nocturnal insects, earwigs only hunt after sunset, but feed primarily just after sunset occurs. Feeding habits of females depend more on their ovulatory cycle, and will go long periods of time without eating in preparation of egg laying.|$|R

40|$|Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) {{have been}} present in North America since {{the arrival of the}} {{earliest}} settlers in the sixteenth century. Colonists originally released hogs because of the animals’ ability to survive on their own and to serve as a <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> supply for settlers. Since that time, hogs have expanded their range and now are present in 40 of the 50 United States and parts of Canada. Their rapid expansion {{is similar to that of}} other introduced species, and, as a result, they are generally classified as an invasive exotics, along with hundreds of other plant and animal species. However, feral hogs may pose an ecological threat that far surpasses that posed by other invasive vertebrates...|$|R

50|$|A {{sperm whale}} rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex on 20 November 1820 (a report of which {{inspired}} Herman Melville to write Moby-Dick), {{and the crew}} arrived at Henderson on 20 December in three small whaleboats. They found the island's only known drinkable water-source - a brackish spring on the north shore, exposed at half tide - and ate fish, birds, eggs, crabs and peppergrass; but they had largely exhausted the <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> within a week and on 27 December the three boats set sail for South America, leaving behind Thomas Chappel, Seth Weeks, and William Wright who chose to stay, and who survived until their rescue on 9 April 1821.

50|$|The bird {{primarily}} {{moves up}} and down the slopes in search for food. It is, however, uncommon for this species to travel far, due to the change in climate from area to area. This {{is a result of the}} mild winters in their habitat, which are tolerable for longer periods of time. For the majority of the species, travel is only necessary in attempting to avoid the drying out of their vegetation. In this case, they may move down mountain sides for more comfortable living conditions and a <b>readier</b> <b>food</b> supply. There is little information or support on how the Blyth’s tragopan moves, but it is suggested that they travel together in groups of four to five, much like other species of tragopans.|$|R
50|$|The monastery {{was located}} in a {{beautiful}} place, but {{not far from the}} village Raches. A forest near the monastery was harvested for wood to repair the monastery's roof, windows, and doors—and also to make primitive beds. In the beginning, the prisoners lay directly on the floor, but then made the beds. They made the base of twigs of various thickness and the mattresses of ferns. They had no sheets, and so used blankets, bags, and quilts. Near the monastery was also a river where they washed themselves and washed clothes. Dimitris Dalianis and his colleagues had to organize cooking, baking of bread, transportation of food, everything had to be done on site because it was too far to transport the <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> on the mule.|$|R

40|$|The {{local food}} “movement” has gained {{strength}} nationwide {{as well as}} right here in Nebraska. The production and consumption of nearly table <b>ready</b> <b>food</b> has gained popularity and has an important economic impact for those farmers and businesses involved in that segment of agriculture. The past decade has seen substantial and growing interest in the promotion of local food systems throughout the United States. The increasing consumer demands for fresh local produce and other farm products are driven by the beliefs that local food production systems are more sustainable, healthy, and supportive of local economies. As a testament to rising consumer demands, sales of local food through direct markets have grown tremendously — annual direct-market sales in the U. S. increased from $ 511 million in 1997 to $ 1. 2 billion in 2007 (Martinez et al., 2010) 1...|$|R
