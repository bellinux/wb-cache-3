25|$|The uplifted {{block of}} the Bellarine Peninsula forms a very weakly {{dissected}} undulating plain of low elevation, less than 150m. Drainage from the remnant basalts of the Palaeogene Older Volcanics forms a vaguely radial {{pattern on the}} elevated plateau. A narrow strip of deeply weathered Cretaceous Otway Group rocks occurs in outcrop along {{the southern edge of}} the Curlewis <b>Monocline,</b> which forms the northern boundary of the peninsula. Landslides and narrow gullies have formed along the northern edge of the <b>monocline.</b> A sheet of marine sands of Late Neogene age covers the southern portion of the uplifted Bellarine block.|$|E
25|$|At {{a time in}} the past, <b>monocline</b> {{formed to}} the west of Sydney. The <b>monocline</b> is a sloping bend that raises the {{sandstone}} well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.|$|E
25|$|Fault {{propagation}} folds or tip-line folds {{are caused}} when displacement occurs on an existing fault without further propagation. In both reverse and normal faults {{this leads to}} folding of the overlying sequence, often {{in the form of}} a <b>monocline.</b>|$|E

25|$|Interpretation of {{the eastern}} part of the Tacoma Fault is not entirely settled. Most authors align it with the strong {{gravitational}} anomaly (which typically reflects where faulting has juxtaposed rock of different density) and topographical lineament down Commencement Bay. This follows the front of the Rosedale <b>monocline,</b> a gently southwest-tilting formation that forms the bluffs on which Tacoma is built.|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Wight {{is made up}} of {{a variety}} of rock types dating from early Cretaceous (around 127million years ago) {{to the middle of the}} Palaeogene (around 30million years ago). The {{geological}} structure is dominated by a large <b>monocline</b> which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger Tertiary beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a dip of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at the Needles.|$|E
2500|$|Further complicating this is {{a feature}} of unknown {{structure}} and origin, the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL). This is a seemingly accidental alignment of topographic features that runs roughly east-southeast from {{the north side of}} the Olympic Peninsula to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon. It aligns with the West Coast fault and Queen Charlotte Fault system of strike-slip fault zones (similar to the San Andreas Fault in California) on the west side of Vancouver Island, but does not itself show any significant or through-going strike-slip movement. It is of interest here because the various strands of the Seattle Fault change orientation where they appear to cross the OWL, and various other features, such as the Rosedale <b>monocline</b> and Olympia structure, and a great many local topographical features, have parallel alignments. It may also be the original location of the Darrington—Devils Mountain Fault (the dashed line [...] "X" [...] at the top of the following map). The OWL appears to be a deep-seated structure over which the shallower crust of the Puget Lowland is being pushed, but this remains speculative.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for constructing a composite {{profile of a}} very gently folded sedimentary multilayer sequence, some 1200 m thick, is introduced and applied. Accuracy checks and balances are discussed. Real changes in layer thickness {{are found to be}} related to the position, attitude and intensity of folds. Upright as well as verging, open sinusoidal megafolds formed during diagenesis and compaction. <b>Monoclines</b> (macrokinks) formed late during the deformation history, and are antithetic with respect to the regional couple force. Most macrokinks eventually became locked. In some cases thrusting of the steep limb seems to have accompanied shortening inside the kinkband immediately before the locking occurred. Other <b>monoclines</b> have developed sets of short listric normal faults on the steep limb that merge with the beds on their downthrow side. The association of all structures is readily explained by a theory of visco-elastic folding of multilayers with varying competency. Some 50 % of the stratiform uranium mineralization that is associated with the thicker, more permeable sandstone units occurs in <b>monoclines.</b> The positioning of <b>monoclines</b> relative to the axial planes of the early megafolds seems to be controlled by thickness variations in sequences of macrocycles. These variations can be linked to changes in transport direction across syndepositional early folds. Macrokinks can therefore be considered a valuable additional indicator for exploration targets. © 1994. Articl...|$|R
50|$|Tectonic {{activity}} resumed in Mid Cenozoic {{time and}} started to unevenly uplift and slightly tilt the Colorado Plateau region and the region to the west some 20 million years ago (as much as 3 kilometers of uplift occurred). Streams had their gradient increased and they responded by downcutting faster. Headward erosion and mass wasting helped to erode cliffs back into their fault-bounded plateaus, widening the basins in-between. Some plateaus have been so severely reduced in size this way that they become mesas or even buttes. <b>Monoclines</b> form {{as a result of}} uplift bending the rock units. Eroded <b>monoclines</b> leave steeply tilted resistant rock called a hogback and the less steep version is a cuesta.|$|R

5000|$|The Purbeck <b>Monocline</b> is a {{geological}} fold. The term 'fold' {{is used in}} geology {{when one}} or more originally flat sedimentary strata surfaces are bent or curved {{as a result of}} plastic (i.e. permanent) deformation. A <b>monocline</b> is a step-like fold, in which one limb is roughly horizontal. The Purbeck <b>Monocline</b> was formed during the late Oligocene and early Miocene epochs, about 30 million years ago. It is the northernmost 'ripple' of the Alpine Orogeny.|$|E
50|$|According to Whitney in 1890 and Kelley in 1955, Charles Darwin {{used the}} term uniclinal prior to 1843 to {{describe}} to strata dipping uniformly in one direction. Later in 1843, Rogers and Rogers created the term <b>monocline</b> {{and used it to}} describe beds dipping uniformly in one direction within the Appalachian Mountains. However, starting with Powell in 1873, geologists also used <b>monocline</b> to specifically described a step-like fold in otherwise uniformly dipping strata while other geologists still used it to describe beds dipping uniformly in one direction. Thus, the term <b>monocline</b> was used to describe both beds dipping in one direction and a one-limbed flexure with different authors making incompatible distinctions between them. Because of this confused usage of <b>monocline,</b> Daly formally introduced the term homocline and in 1915 and 1916 defined it in its current usage and redefined <b>monocline</b> as a one-limbed flexure as it is currently used.|$|E
50|$|The Purbeck <b>Monocline</b> {{gives rise}} to the {{prominent}} ridge of steeply dipping Cretaceous chalk which now forms the Purbeck Hills. This chalk band runs from Swyre Head via Flower's Barrow to Old Harry Rocks. From here the fold continues under the sea to The Needles and forms the central spine of the Isle of Wight. Here it is also known as the Purbeck-Isle of Wight Disturbance. The <b>monocline</b> continues under the English Channel as the Wight-Bray <b>Monocline.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Outcrop {{observations}} and laboratory experiments show that many small chevron folds form by interference of monoclinal kink bands in multilayer buckling. Kink-band interference {{has also been}} proposed for some map-scale folds. Furthermore, fault-related folding provides additional mechanisms of monoclinal fold generation, other than buckling, and thus makes kink-band interference all the more conceptually plausible as a significant large-scale process. In this paper we document several relatively simple examples of map-scale monoclinal fold interference, including three interfering <b>monoclines</b> of the Colorado Plateau, a seismically-imaged example in the Perdido foldbelt of the Gulf of Mexico, and a more complex example from seismic mapping in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. Kink-band interference has normally been analyzed in cross section. Here we emphasize the map-view phenomena and present a simple balanced three-dimensional mode 1 of the interference geometry, treating the <b>monoclines</b> as two independent kink bands, which does not depend of the kink-band folding mechanism. This model predicts {{the shape of the}} jog produced by crossing <b>monoclines</b> and is used to help evaluate the role of interference in the map-view geometry of our examples. The documentation of these simple examples supports the concept that more complex monoclinal fold interference could be a significant phenomenon in the upper crust. 7; 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2500|$|The Laramide orogeny {{compacted}} {{the region}} from about 70 million to 50 {{million years ago}} {{and in the process}} created the Rocky Mountains. Many <b>monoclines</b> (a type of gentle upward fold in rock strata) were also formed by the deep compressive forces of the Laramide. [...] One of those <b>monoclines,</b> called the Waterpocket Fold, is the major geographic feature of the park. The 100mile (160km) long fold has a north-south alignment with a steeply east-dipping side. The rock layers {{on the west side of}} the Waterpocket Fold have been lifted more than 7,000feet (2,100m) higher than the layers on the east. Thus older rocks are exposed on the western part of the fold and younger rocks on the eastern part. This particular fold may have been created due to movement along a fault in the Precambrian basement rocks hidden well below any exposed formations. Small earthquakes centered below the fold in 1979may be from such a fault.|$|R

Igneous activity in the form of volcanism and dike and sill intrusion also occurred during this time.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{geologic}} record preserves {{three different}} groups of rock and sediment. The oldest rocks are Early to Middle Proterozoic gneiss and schist, including the Ute Canyon Stock. Overlying these, and separated by an angular unconformity, are mostly horizontally bedded Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, including the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. Overlying these are various types of Quaternary unconsolidated deposits such as alluvium, colluvium, and dunes. The sedimentary rocks are folded into <b>monoclines</b> by several faults, including the Redlands Thrust Fault.|$|R
