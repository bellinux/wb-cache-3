40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{develop and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the applicability of}} a classification system for induction of labour (IOL) that fulfils recognised classification system attributes for clinical, surveillance and research purposes. DESIGN Proof of concept. SETTING, POPULATION Applicability demonstrated in a population cohort of 909, 702 <b>maternities</b> in New South Wales, Australia, 2002 - 2011. METHODS A multidisciplinary collaboration developed a classification system through a systematic literature review, development of a clinically logical model, and presentation to stakeholders for feedback and refinement. Classification factors included parity (nulliparous, parous), previous caesarean section (CS), gestational age (≤ 36, 37 - 38, 39 - 40, ≥ 41 weeks gestation), number (singleton, multiple) and presentation of the fetus (cephalic, non-cephalic). We determined: the size of each classification group, the contribution each group made to overall IOL rates, and within-group IOL rates (calculated as proportions of all <b>maternities,</b> all <b>maternities</b> excluding prelabour CS and of all continuing <b>maternities).</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Applicability of IOL classification using routinely collected obstetric data. RESULTS A 10 group classification system was developed. Of all <b>maternities,</b> 25. 4...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{traditional}} {{philosophies of}} Māori motherhood. Drawing from traditional accounts of our cosmologies, from mōteatea, whakatauki and pakiwaitara, {{it seeks to}} uncover aspects of our <b>maternities</b> that for many Māori mothers today have become buried under the plethora of Western maternal knowledges. Māori <b>maternities</b> represent a conflicted space for Māori women and whānau in contemporary Aotearoa/New Zealand. Colonisation has acted to significantly corrupt a traditionally empowering and healthy philosophy of Māori motherhood. Successive legislative and social interventions have, over many generations, served to undermine the powerful position of the maternal in Māori society, to denigrate {{the sanctity of the}} Māori maternal body and to destroy a collective and supportive approach to raising children. This thesis draws on Māori and indigenous legal theories, on mana wahine theories and on kaupapa Māori theories in its analysis. It unpacks some of the specific legislative and policy initiatives introduced by the state that have served to undermine traditional Māori <b>maternities.</b> In the face of a comprehensive and targeted colonisation process, Māori <b>maternities</b> have survived and continue to be a site of resistance and empowerment for Māori whānau. Despite the best attempts of the state to undermine Māori <b>maternities,</b> Māori whānau have continued to mother in ways that reflect our traditional philosophies of mothering. Finally, this thesis also proposes a theory of Māori motherhood that is grounded in our traditions, philosophies and ideologies. It concludes that Māori <b>maternities</b> are a significant space of resistance and tino rangatiratanga for Māori today...|$|R
40|$|Triplets are a {{relatively}} rare occurrence being {{encountered in the}} Maltese Islands with an overall incidence of about 0. 1 per 1000 <b>maternities.</b> The incidence {{appears to be on}} the increase over the last twenty years rising from the 0. 08 per 1000 <b>maternities</b> in the decade 1960 - 69 to 0. 11 per 1000 <b>maternities</b> in the following two decades. This increase has been correlated with the increasing use of ovulation induction agents, as has the occurrence of two quadruplets and one octuplet pregnancies in 1988 - 90. Triplets are shown to occur more frequently in elderly mothers, but no relationship to parity could be identified. Higher order births are shown to have a high incidence of antenatal and intrapartum problems, and are associated with a higher fetal loss than singleton pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|In the triennium 2006 - 2008, 261 {{women in}} the UK died {{directly}} or indirectly related to pregnancy. The overall maternal mortality rate was 11. 39 per 100, 000 <b>maternities.</b> Direct deaths decreased from 6. 24 per 100, 000 <b>maternities</b> in 2003 - 2005 to 4. 67 per 100, 000 <b>maternities</b> in 2006 – 2008 (p = 0. 02). This decline is predominantly due to the reduction in deaths from thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhage. For the first time {{there has been a}} reduction in the inequalities gap, with a significant decrease in maternal mortality rates among those living in the most deprived areas and those in the lowest socio-economic group. Despite a decline in the overall UK maternal mortality rate, there has been an increase in deaths related to genital tract sepsis, particularly from community acquired Group A streptococcal disease. The mortality rate related to sepsis increased from 0. 85 deaths per 100, 000 <b>maternities</b> in 2003 - 2005 to 1. 13 deaths in 2006 - 2008, and sepsis is now {{the most common cause of}} Direct maternal death.

40|$|Background It {{is beyond}} doubt that blood {{transfusion}} services {{have added to}} the decline in maternal mortality in high-resource countries. To quantify the clinical benefit of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in obstetric care, we performed a hypothetical experimental study using data from a prospective nationwide cohort of women giving birth in the Netherlands. Study Design and Methods Data were abstracted from a nationwide cohort study on severe maternal morbidity, including obstetric haemorrhage requiring 4 or more units of RBC, to obtain an observed and a hypothetical control group consisting of the same women. In the hypothetical control group, we simulated a situation where RBC transfusion was unavailable and estimated {{how many of these}} women would have died in that situation. A questionnaire survey asked experts in major (obstetric) haemorrhage to choose a critical minimal number of RBC transfusions at which a woman with obstetric haemorrhage would have died if RBC transfusion was not available. Maternal mortality rate per 100000 <b>maternities</b> [maternal mortality ratios (MMR) ] and relative risk were calculated for the observed and hypothetical group. Results The observed MMR was 13 per 100000 <b>maternities.</b> According to 47 responding experts, the median number of RBC units without which a woman would have most probably died was nine, resulting in a hypothetical MMR of 87 per 100000 <b>maternities</b> (relative risk 6 · 5; 95 % confidence interval 4 · 2 - 10 · 0). Conclusions It can be expected that unavailability of RBC transfusion in obstetric care increases the risk of maternal death 6. 5 -fold. Blood transfusion thus largely contributes to the decline of MMR and would also be an important pillar of improving quality of care in resource-poor settings. © 2012 International Society of Blood Transfusion...|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the causes and}} mechanisms of twinning and higher multifetal <b>maternities,</b> we {{have taken advantage of}} the statistical sources of Sweden, where continuous statistics for the whole population are the oldest available. We found strong secular and regional fluctuations. The rates of multiple <b>maternities</b> were the highest during the last three decades of the 18 th century, when the twinning rate was more than 17 per 1, 000, the triplet rate was more than 3 per 10, 000, and the quadruplet rate was almost 7 per 1 million <b>maternities.</b> During 1849 – 1873 the twinning rate in Sweden was 14. 2 per 1, 000, but this rate showed great regional differences, being 18. 0 per 1, 000 on the island of Gotland and 12. 6 per 1, 000 in the county ofA¨ lvsborg. During this period the twinning rate in the countryside in the county of Stockholm was 20. 4, but in the city of Stockholm it was only 14. 1 per 1, 000. In Sweden after the 1930 s there was a marked decrease in the twinning rate, which by the 1960 s had fallen to only about half of what it had been two centuries earlier. The corresponding reductions for triplet and quadruplet rates were about 75 %. The aim of this paper was to study the temporal and regional variations in multiple <b>maternities</b> in Sweden from 1751 to 1960 based on demographic and some socioeconomic data for the counties. We confirmed our earlier studies that maternal age and parity cannot satisfactorily explain the secular and regional differences in the twinning rates. In contrast to studies in France (1901 – 1968), we found no unequivocal association between the twinning rates and the crude birth rates. The correlation coefficients between the twinning rate and the crude birth rate showed statistically significant regional and temporal variations. After eliminating the temporal trends, regional differences in the correlation coefficients remained. The twinning rates for the counties seem to converge toward a common low level, 10 – 12 per 1, 000. The observed convergence toward relatively similar levels may be caused by the increased matrimonial migration distances and decreased endogamy of the citizens as a consequence of better communications. The increased urbanization and industrialization that started in the last decades of the 19 th century broke up the old static agrarian isolates and caused Sweden, within 2 – 3 generations, to develop from a poor nation {{to one of the most}} prosperous in the world. A more urban and affluent lifestyle, a better diet, and increased stress and sedentary occupations may have reduced the physical capacity of mothers to carry gestations with multiple embryos or fetuses to completion...|$|R
