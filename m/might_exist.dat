5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet <b>might</b> <b>exist</b> beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan <b>might</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves <b>might</b> <b>exist,</b> with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E
50|$|A very {{important}} reason that makes communities {{important is that}} they often have very different properties than the average properties of the networks. Thus, only concentrating on the average properties usually misses many important and interesting features inside the networks. For example, in a given social network, both gregarious and reticent groups <b>might</b> <b>exists</b> simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|Entirely separately, around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama {{suspected}} a link <b>might</b> <b>exist</b> between elliptic {{curves and}} modular forms, two completely {{different areas of}} mathematics.

It was widely seen as significant and important in its own right, but was (like Fermat's theorem) widely considered completely inaccessible to proof.|$|E

Friedrich took a Greyhound bus the following day, and stayed with Thomas and a fandom friend, Dave Kaler, in Manhattan's East Village. Shortly afterward, Friedrich and Thomas took an apartment on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers have debated {{both the}} truth of determinism, and {{the truth of}} free will. This creates the four {{possible}} positions in the figure. Compatibilism refers {{to the view that}} free will is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three incompatibilist positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The hard incompatibilists hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the libertarianists that determinism does not hold, and free will <b>might</b> <b>exist,</b> and the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.|$|E

Many individuals share similar facial features and faces on people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that <b>might</b> <b>exist.</b> Experts will rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.|$|E
