500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] is an R-pop music {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, lasting for a duration for four minutes and 52 seconds. The theme of social activism {{can be heard}} in the lyrics [...] "There’s got to be a way / to connect this world today." [...] The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone. Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> aware." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{referred}} to Blink-182 as the band's [...] "underrated masterwork," [...] writing that {{the record is}} generally considered by [...] "fans, critics and band members alike as its best work, Blink's answer to Pet Sounds or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] The band themselves have regarded it as a [...] "huge turning point" [...] in their career, marking {{a change in the}} way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir Can I Say, Barker writes: [...] "It {{had a little bit of}} everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> happy, but not so far that we offended our fan base. It was a perfect happy medium, and it's the Blink album that Mark, Tom, and I are most proud of." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{addition}} to the group's filmmaking career, Wong Fu Productions has organized a series of multidisciplinary concerts in California. The concert series, International Secret Agents (ISA), featured musical disciplines from urban dance to deejaying with Asian American guest artists such as Far East Movement. Additional guest performances included America's Best Dance Crew champions Quest Crew and Poreotics, Ryan Higa (aka Nigahiga), Kevin Wu (aka KevJumba), Jay Park, and singers–songwriters David Choi and Kina Grannis. According to Chinese American rapper Jin, [...] "ISA is about self-branding and viral marketing— using YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and the Internet to promote yourself as an artist." [...] He asserted, [...] "We as artists are aware of this and <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> available [...]" [...] Far East Movement member Virman Coquia said, [...] "We want {{to give back to}} the community to show that Asians can have an influence today in the U.S." [...] Additionally, Coquia believed that ISA presented the opportunity to present Asian American talent as cool and mainstream.|$|E
500|$|Cope was {{described}} by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as [...] "a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity". To him, Fowler wrote, [...] " [...] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful." [...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might <b>make</b> <b>ourselves,</b> were we bolder".|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E

By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary.

However, the strikers reiterated their original demands of 12,500 rand a month, three times the current salary, saying that they had already sacrificed too much to settle for anything.

2500|$|Catholicism's way of {{thinking}} is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of St. Ignatius of Loyola: [...] "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things {{on the face of}} the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to <b>make</b> <b>ourselves</b> indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created." ...|$|E
