50|$|The {{face milling}} process can in {{principle}} produce very flat surfaces. However, in practice the result always shows visible trochoidal marks following {{the motion of}} points on the cutter's end face. These revolution marks give the characteristic finish of a face <b>milled</b> <b>surface.</b> Revolution marks can have significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end face {{and the degree of}} perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and feed direction. Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed.. In a precise face milling operation, the revolution marks will only be microscopic scratches due to imperfections in the cutting edge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{experimental}} {{evaluation of the}} surface microstructural integrity of Si 3 N 4 ceramics milled with abrasive waterjet was studied. The {{results show that the}} surface residual stress resulting from abrasive waterjet milling process for ceramics is compressive, and the compressive residual stress ranges from negative 203 MPa to negative 19. 6 MPa. The results also show that the water pressure, the standoff distance, nozzle traverse speed and the lateral spacing have strong effects on the surface residual stress. The results also show that there is some enhancement in the hardness of AWJ milling surface, and it is affected by milling process parameters. The micro-topography of the <b>milled</b> <b>surface</b> cross section shows that there is a thin deteriorative layer in milled layer, in which no obvious crack is observed. Since the surface residual stress is compressive and the surface hardness increases, the <b>milled</b> <b>surface</b> deteriorative layer by AWJ could improve the surface quality...|$|E

Therefore, in this condition, the <b>milled</b> <b>surface</b> roughness {{generated by the}} CAD–CAM system was not increased by air abrasion; on the contrary, there was a tendency to decrease roughness (without reaching a statistical level) explained by a probable wear of higher topographical aspects of the surface morphology leading to a more homogeneous surface.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} theoretical and experimental {{investigations into the}} effect of the workpiece material on surface roughness in ultraprecision raster milling (UPRM). The influence of material elastic recovery on chip thickness and surface generation in UPRM is studied. A holistic surface roughness prediction model is developed by considering the influences of cutting parameters, tool geometry and the material elastic recovery on surface generation. The experimental results show that the proposed surface roughness prediction model makes a more precise prediction by adding the elastic recovery rate as a material factor, and the presence of elastic recovery improves the surface finishing of the raster <b>milled</b> <b>surface.</b> The material effect on surface roughness decreases with the increasing of feed rate. The precipitates in the machining of aluminum alloy 6061 result in the generation of imperfection on the raster <b>milled</b> <b>surface.</b> The machining of aluminum bronze has the greatest influence on surface roughness among the three materials being cut, which is due to its high elastic recovery rate and hardness.

40|$|Micromachining {{relies on}} precise tool {{geometry}} for effective material removal and acceptable surface finish. The detrimental built-up-edges (BUEs) not only degrade {{the surface finish}} of machined features, but also pose a concern for critical applications when BUE can be eventually detached from machined surface. This work presents experimental study on conditions for BUE formation and its effects in micro milling of biocompatible 316 L stainless steel. Surface finish and BUE density on a micro <b>milled</b> <b>surface</b> are used to quantify the presence of BUE. A new micro tool is used for each milling condition. A BUE, embedded onto a <b>milled</b> <b>surface,</b> is identified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Optical microscopy is used to quantify BUE density at different locations and milling parameters. Surface finish data from meso-scale milling agree with predicted surface finish, but the model fails to predict the surface finish in micro-scale milling. Micro milling resulted in rough surface finish at low cutting speeds and chip loads due to formation and detachment of BUE from tool surface to machined surface. Hence a new surface finish model including the effect of BUE and tool wear was developed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{in vitro}} study was aimed to {{investigate}} the attachment, spreading and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts to milled and polished non-veneered ceramic surfaces in alumina and zirconia and to ceramic surfaces veneered by {{two different types of}} porcelain baseliners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibroblasts were cultured on discs of pressed alumina or zirconia, on discs which had been milled, on discs comprising alumina or zirconia which had been polished, on discs of alumina veneered with NobelRondo baseliner Al, on discs of zirconia veneered with Cercon-S baseliner, and on alumina or zirconia discs veneered with the above baseliners and then polished. The surfaces were analyzed using an optical interferometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell profile areas were measured using SEM and an image analyzer. Cell attachment was determined after 3 and 24 h as a ratio of the cell profiles and the total micrograph area and was expressed as percent of attachment. MTT analyses were undertaken to determine cellular attachment after 3 h of incubation and cellular proliferation after 7 days. RESULTS: The polished zirconia specimens had the smoothest surface in terms of average height deviation (S(a) = 0. 03 microm) : the roughest were the zirconia specimens with <b>milled</b> <b>surfaces</b> (S(a) = 0. 36 microm). The application of the baseliners resulted in surfaces smoother than those of the non-veneered discs. The <b>milled</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both alumina and zirconia had significantly higher percentages of cell attachment and proliferation than the other <b>surfaces</b> whereas the <b>milled</b> <b>surfaces</b> in zirconia demonstrated better cellular attachment after 3 and 24 h of culture than the one in alumina. Fibroblasts attached and grew effectively on the surfaces veneered with NobelRondo throughout the experiments, whereas the zirconia surfaces veneered with Cercon-S had the lowest percentage of cell attachment and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the roughness of all surfaces investigated was < 0. 4 mum, the study disclosed significant differences in cellular attachment and proliferation associated with the various surface modifications...|$|R
