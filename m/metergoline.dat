To evaluate possible neurotransmissions involvement, ineffective doses of <b>metergoline</b> (3 mg/kg - non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist), sulpiride (20 mg/kg - non-selective dopaminergic receptor antagonist) or ketamine (0. 125 mg/kg - non-selective glutamate receptor antagonist) were acutely administered in association with the aqueous fraction of P. cupana. Both aqueous fraction and paroxetine decrease the inhibitory avoidance latencies of the elevated T-maze, indicating anxiolytic effect and increased one-way escape latencies from the open arm of the elevated T-maze, indicating a panicolytic effect. The pretreatment with <b>metergoline,</b> sulpiride and ketamine blocked the anxiolytic effect of aqueous fraction. The panicolytic effect of aqueous fraction was blocked by both <b>metergoline</b> and sulpiride.

40|$|Baicalein {{is known}} to be a potent {{antifungal}} agent and induces programmed cell death in Candida albicans. In the present study, we found that baicalein also inhibited the growth of C. krusei isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of baicalein against eight C. krusei isolates were 1. 35 [...] 2. 70 microg/ml. One-hour exposure to baicalein elicited a consistent and moderate post-antifungal effect on the C. krusei isolates. Further flow cytometric study demonstrated a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. However, both the levels of reactive oxygen species and DNA fragmentation were not significantly changed after baicalein treatment in C. krusei. It can be concluded that the antifungal activity of baicalein was mitochondria-dependent in both C. krusei and C. albicans, but the antifungal mechanism was different. Reactive oxygen species may not play a direct role and baicalein does not initiate programmed cell death or apoptosis in C. krusei. The structure-activity relationship study showed that the three hydroxyl groups in baicalein were essential for its antifungal potency. Candidiasis has become a serious infection with very high mortality and morbidity in the world if not providing effective treatments. However, due to clinical limitation and resistance of the current antifungal agents, there is an urgent need to search for novel antifungals. In this study, after screening a compound library (n= 400) for antifungal activity, three members (<b>metergoline,</b> purpurin and baicalein) were chosen for further study. Their antifungal characteristics and the antifungal mechanisms were investigated. <b>Metergoline,</b> a serotonin receptor antagonist, was found to have potent antifungal activity against the intrinsically fluconazole-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida krusei. The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal fungicidal concentration of <b>metergoline</b> against C. krusei were 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml respectively. <b>Metergoline</b> induced post-antifungal effect. Significant synergism was found in combination of <b>metergoline</b> with amphotericin B by a checkerboard assay, which {{may be due to the}} perturbation of cell permeability and increase in the intracellular accumulation of antifungal agents. <b>Metergoline</b> also inhibited extracellular phospholipase production in C. krusei. To gain insights into the mechanisms, intracellular changes that accompany apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry and spectrophotometry. The results showed an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, phosphatidylserine externalization, and positive terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling in the metergoline-treated C. krusei. Taken together, we conclude that <b>metergoline</b> may promote apoptosis in C. krusei through reactive oxygen species production and perturbation in mitochondrial homeostasis, implying its antifungal potential to treat candidiasis. The antifungal activity of purpurin, a natural red anthraquinone pigment in madder root (Rubia tinctorum L.), was evaluated against Candida isolates by a broth microdilution assay. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of purpurin against Candida species isolates were 1. 28 [...] 5. 12 microg/ml. Mechanistic studies indicated that purpurin inhibited energy-dependent efflux pumps of Candida isolates. Furthermore, purpurin demonstrated a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting a possible linkage of the antifungal mechanism of purpurin to Candida apoptosis. Kang, Kai.

In contrast, the non-selective 5 -HT antagonists <b>metergoline,</b> methiothepin, mesulergine, mianserin and methysergide (all of which have high affinity for various 5 -HT 1 receptor subtypes), dose-dependently increased food intake during a 4 -h daytime test.

Surprisingly, mesulergine decreased food intake over a 24 -h period at the same doses that increased daytime food intake. This may indicate that the increase in daytime feeding produced by mesulergine is a non-specific response.

To {{better understand the}} drug-receptor interaction producing the inactivation, we 1) expanded the list of inactivating drugs, 2) determined the inactivating potencies and efficacies by performing concentration-response experiments, and 3) determined the potencies and efficacies of the inactivators as irreversible binding site inhibitors. Three new drugs were found to fully inactivate the h 5 -HT 7 receptor: lisuride, bromocryptine, and <b>metergoline.</b> As inactivators, these drugs displayed potencies of 1, 80, and 321 nM, respectively. Pretreatment of 5 -HT 7 -expressing HEK cells with increasing concentrations of the inactivating drugs risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone, methiothepin, lisuride, bromocriptine, and <b>metergoline</b> potently inhibited radiolabeling of the h 5 -HT 7 receptor, with IC 50 values of 9, 5. 5, 152, 3, 73, and 10 nM, respectively. We were {{surprised to find that}} maximal concentrations of risperidone and 9 -OH-risperidone inhibited only 50 % of the radiolabeling of h 5 -HT 7 receptors.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{and malaria}} {{continue}} to be major public health concerns, globally claiming 2 - 3 million deaths every year. A number of efficacious drugs are available {{for the treatment of}} TB and malaria, which, through various combination therapies, are fully effective in treating these diseases. However, the wide spread resistance in M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and P. falciparum, the causative agents of TB and malaria, respectively, has made the existing therapies less effective. Thus novel agents able to circumvent drug resistance and other challenges associated with existing TB and malaria treatments are urgently needed. The development of a new drug is a lengthy and costly process; therefore, approaches that can save both time and money need to be emphasised. Drug repositioning is one such approach that has been applied in this project. Drug repositioning basically involves a situation where a drug active in one disease is derivatised or used as a template for the synthesis of derivatives active in another disease. This approach has the potential to significantly shorten the drug discovery process. This study focused on the repositioning of two drugs, the antibacterial agent fusidic acid and the antipsychotic agent <b>metergoline,</b> in TB and/or malaria via medicinal chemistry approaches.

40|$|TB {{patients}} show poor compliance to available drugs {{due to the}} costs, adverse side effects, {{and prolonged}} treatment, leading to multi-drug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and most recently totally drug resistant TB. Shared drug toxicities and drug interactions with antiretrovirals compound the problem. The rapid development of resistance to known antimalarials compared to {{the rate at which}} new agents are coming into the market still remains a big challenge is combating malaria. Currently, with resistance to ACTs having been documented in South-East Asia, the situation is dire as there is no ready alternative to these drugs. There is thus a heightened need for research towards the development of new anti-TB and anti-malarial drugs based on novel chemotypes. Towards addressing this need, SAR studies were conducted on the 2 -amino- 4 -aryl thiazole scaffold by synthesizing a series of derivatives with different motifs at the various positions of the scaffold. These derivatives exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity in the CQS strain of P. falciparum, and good antimycobacterial activity on the H 37 Rv strain of M. tb. A 2 -pyridyl group at position 4 of the thiazole ring as well as a substituted phenyl at position 2 was found to be essential for antimycobacterial activity. However, the 2 -pyridyl group was not essential for antiplasmodial activity while the substituted phenyl at position 2 was essential for antiplasmodial activity. The linker between these two groups affected antimycobacterial activity with little influence on the antiplasmodial activity. In addition structural modifications were performed on the ergoline backbone of <b>metergoline,</b> and a number of derivatives synthesized with different para substituted phenyls. These compounds exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity in the CQS strain of P. falciparum, and moderate antimycobacterial activity on the H 37 Rv strain of M. tb. The presence of a substituted phenyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine was found to be essential for antimycobacterial activity, however, this substituted phenyl group didn't confer optimum antimycobacterial activity as the compounds were less active than <b>metergoline.</b> The antiplasmodial activity of these compounds was better than that of <b>metergoline</b> and was enhanced by the hydrophobicity of the substituent on the phenyl ring.

The present study was designed to elucidate whether the activation of the central serotonergic pathway enhances adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone secretion, and if so, whether the CRH and vasopressin neuronal systems could be mediating this effect. Intraperitoneal administration of a low dose of L- 5 -hydroxytryptophan (an aromatic L-amino acid precursor of serotonin synthesis; 20 mg/kg bw, 30 minutes before the sacrifice) in rats pretreated with pargyline (a brain monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which enhances monoamine activity; 75 mg/Kg bw, 16 hours before the sacrifice) and carbidopa (a peripheral active inhibitor of the decarboxylation of aromatic L-amino acids, which would permit more monoamine precursor to be available to the brain; 50 mg/Kg bw, 90 minutes before the sacrifice) increased ACTH and corticosterone secretion in plasma. Such an effect was partially blocked by <b>metergoline</b> (a serotonin type- 1 and- 2 receptor blocker; 1 mg/Kg bw, 90 minutes before the sacrifice), but not by spiperone (a serotonin type- 2 and dopamine receptor antagonist; 0. 5 mg/Kg bw. 90 minutes before the sacrifice). The activation of the central serotonergic system enhanced the CRH content in the median eminence, whereas it decreased the content of this neuropeptide in the medial basal hypothalamus. These effects were fully abolished by <b>metergoline,</b> but not by spiperone pretreatment. The activation of the serotonergic pathway did not influence the vasopressinergic neuronal system.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is an {{important}} regulator of the mammalian circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN); however, critical questions remain concerning the control of serotonergic activity in the SCN and how this relates to the putative clock-resetting actions of 5 -HT. Previously, we reported that electrical stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or median raphe nucleus (MRN) in hamsters evoked 5 -HT release in the SCN. This DRN-stimulated 5 -HT release was blocked by systemic injection of 5 -HT antagonists, indicating a 5 -HT receptor-mediated pathway from the DRN to the SCN. In the present study, targeted injections of the 5 -HT 1, 2, 7 antagonist <b>metergoline</b> or the selective 5 -HT 7 antagonist DR 4004 into the DRN or MRN attenuated DRN-electrically stimulated SCN 5 -HT release, supporting a multisynaptic DRN 3 MRN 3 SCN route. Intra-DRN and intra-MRN injections of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline significantly stimulated SCN 5 -HT release, whereas intra-DRN or intra-MRN injections of the GABAA agonist muscimol suppressed this release. The 5 -HT release induced by intra-DRN bicuculline was also blocked by co-injection of DR 4004. In complementary behavioral trials, SCN 5 -HT release associated with a phase-advancing sleep deprivation stimulus at midday was prevented by intra-DRN injection of <b>metergoline.</b> Also, phase-advance shifts induced by novel wheel access at midday were suppressed, but not blocked, by intra-DRN injection of DR 4004 or muscimol.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{lysergic acid diethylamide}} (LSD), 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -methylamphetamine (DOM), {{quipazine}} or lisunde alone and {{in combination with the}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine antagonists meter-goline, pizotifen and cinansenn were studied in rats responding on a fixed-ratio 40 schedule of food presentation. LSD, DOM, quipazine or Iisunde produced a similar dose-dependent de-crease in the number of food presentations (ED values: 81,g/ kg, 0. 6 mg/kg, 1. 6 mg/kg and 31 ag/kg, respectively) and a reciprocal {{increase in the number of}} pause intervals (IRTs = 10 sec). All three antagonists attenuated the behavioral effects of LSD and DOM for both food presentations and pause intervals. The LSD-response curve for reinforcers was shifted to the greatest degree by pizotifen (1. 0 mg/kg), followed by cinanserin (20 mg/kg) and <b>metergoline</b> (1. 0 mg/kg). The ED values fo...|$|E
40|$|Small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} cells express different {{plasma membrane}} im. n um acetylcholine receptor subtypes. We have now found that inter acting with these receptors (-) -nicotine induces a dose-dependent and stereoselective release of [3 H]serotonin which {{is dependent on}} external calcium and blocked by the specific ganglionic nicotinic antagonist nice a-mylamine. With the same potency (-(-nicotine stimulates tumor cell pro liferation, an effect also blocked by mecamylamine. Serotonin itself stimu lates cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, an effect blocked by the selective serotonergic receptor antagonists methiotepine and <b>metergoline.</b> These data suggest that nicotine might affect proliferation of smallcell lung carcinoma cells by inducing the release of hormones (such as serotonin) with autocrine capabilities and place both the nicotinic and the serotonergic receptors at key positions in the biological and, possibly, pharmacological approach to this human lung cancer...|$|E
40|$|In normal adult rats anesthetized with urethane, {{intravenous}} {{injections of}} beta-endorphin (30 [...] 150 micrograms kg- 1) induced a transient fall of blood pressure {{followed by a}} small hypertension and a prolonged hypotension. Prior administration of naloxone completely blocked these effects, whereas naloxone, given 1 hr after beta-endorphin, did not reverse the prolonged depressor phase of the opioid peptide. The effects of beta-endorphin on the arterial blood pressure were greatly reduced in animals pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine, a specific depletor of serotonin. Moreover, in rats pretreated with potent serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, mianserin, and <b>metergoline,</b> beta-endorphin did not produce a significant hypotension. Furthermore, the depressor effect of beta-endorphin was potentiated by fluoxetine, a specific serotonin uptake inhibitor. These observations suggest the participation of a serotonergic pathway in the action of beta-endorphin on the arterial blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|Sumatriptan (GR 43175) {{contracts}} {{rings of}} dog isolated saphenous vein by an action at 5 -HT 1 -like receptors. We have now {{examined the effects}} of sumatriptan on prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) -stimulated adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in this tissue. Sumatriptan and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PGE 2 -stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation (EC 50 values of 250 nM and 80 nM respectively), responses that were mimicked by 5 -carboxamidotryptamine but not by U- 46619 or methoxamine. The response to sumatriptan (1 microM) was antagonised by methiothepin (1 microM), but not by <b>metergoline</b> (0. 1 microM), spiperone (1 microM) or ondansetron (GR 38032, 1 microM). These results suggest that 5 -HT 1 -like receptors which mediate contraction of the dog isolated saphenous vein are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in this preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{injection}} of fenfluramine (7. 5 mg kg- 1,i. p.) to rats housed at 27 - 28 degrees C {{was associated with}} an elevation of core body temperature which peaked at approximately 1 h post-injection. One h pretreatment with citalopram (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.), chlorimipramine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.), femoxetine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and fluoxetine (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.) resulted in an attenuated response to fenfluramine. In contrast, Org 6582 (20 mg kg- 1) and zimelidine (20 mg kg- 1) were devoid of an effect on fenfluramine-induced hyperthermia. The response to fenfluramine was was also blocked by i. p. injections of <b>metergoline</b> (0. 2 mg kg- 1), methysergide (5 mg kg- 1) and mianserin (0. 5 mg kg- 1). Rectal temperature was unaltered by both the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) uptake inhibitors and the 5 -HT receptor antagonists. The IC 50 values (nM) for in vitro inhibition of [3 H]- 5 -HT uptake into rat hypothalamic synaptosomes were for citalopram 2. 4, chlorimipramine 8. 8, femoxetine 14, fluoxetine 16, Org 6582 75 and zimelidine 250. The {{injection of}} all six compounds (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.) 1 h before death was associated with an inhibition of [3 H]- 5 -HT uptake into rat hypothalamic synaptosomes which ranged from 47. 2 % for chlorimipramine to 83. 3 % for citalopram. Rat hypothalamic 5 -HT levels were decreased by approximately 50 % 3 h after the injection of fenfluramine (15 mg kg- 1, i. p.). This effect was blocked by a 1 h pretreatment with fluoxetine, Org 6582 and zimelidine (all 20 mg kg- 1, i. p.). Ki values for displacement of specifically bound [3 H]- 5 -HT (1 nM) to rat hypothalamic membranes were for <b>metergoline</b> 26 nM, methysergide 1. 1 microM, mianserin 3. 6 microM, chlorimipramine 9. 2 microM and fluoxetine 32. 7 microM. Values for citalopram, femoxetine, Org 6582 and zimelidine were in excess of 65. 4 microM. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Administraon of m-chkrophenAperazine [m-CPP, a {{serotonin}} (5 -Hi) agonist] to rats increases plasma {{concentrations of}} pro-lactin and corticosterone. Pretreatment with various doses of ritansetin (&HT 1 / 5 HT 2 flt 89 Ol 1 ist), ICS 205930 Sfld MDL 72222 (5 -HT 3 antagonists), IOdOCyanOpindOIOI or CG 361 A (beta adrenoceptor antagonists) and spiperone (5 -HT 145 -HT 2 antag-onist) did not attenuate m-CPP-induced increases in plasma concentrations of prolactin. In contrast, pretreatment with var-ious doses of <b>metergoline</b> (5 -HT 1 / 5 -HT 2 antagonist), propranolol (beta adrenoceptor antagonist that also has binding affinity for 5 -HTIA, 5 -HT 15 and 5 -HT 1 sites), mesulergine and mianserin (5 -HT 1 c/ 5 -HT 2 antagonists) attenuated m-CPP-induced increases in plasma prolactin.

40|$|K+-stimulated {{release of}} [3 H]- 5 -hydroxytryptamine ([3 H]- 5 -HT) from rat frontal cortex slices was {{decreased}} by the 5 -HT receptor agonists 5 -methoxy-n 1 N-dimethyltryptamine and 5 -methoxy- 3 (1, 2, 3, 6,-tetrahydro- 4 -pyrindinyl) - 1 H-indole (RU- 24969) (1 X 10 (- 5) M). RU- 24969 (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) decreased extracellular 5 -HT and its metabolite 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid measured in vivo {{by use of}} intracerebral dialysis combined with high performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. The decrease in extracellular 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid in vivo after RU- 24969 (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) was also observed by in vivo voltammetry. The non-selective 5 -HT antagonist <b>metergoline</b> prevented the RU- 24969 -induced decrease in 5 -HT release and metabolism in vivo while the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist R- 55669 (ritanserin) did not. The results {{support the view that}} RU- 24969 stimulates a 5 -HT 1 receptor that is involved in the autoregulation of 5 -HT release and metabolism...|$|E
