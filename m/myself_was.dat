5|$|Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>was</b> {{predicted}} to sell 120,000 – 130,000 units during its first-week in the United States, based upon first day sales. The figure was under-weight compared to his previous effort Raymond vs. Raymond (2010), which sold 329,000 units {{during the same}} period and to date has sold over two million copies worldwide. Despite the low figure estimation, Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>was</b> still expected to top the Billboard 200 chart on the week ending June 17, 2012, and did so with 128,000 first-week copies sold domestically. The album marks Usher's fourth consecutive number one studio album in the United States. The following week of the album's release, Looking 4 Myself dropped to number six on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies. In its third week, the album again dropped positions, falling three spots to number nine, selling 36,000 units. In its fourth week, Looking 4 Myself fell to number fifteen, and in its fifth week rose to number fourteen, selling 20,178 copies. As of October 2014, Looking 4 Myself has sold 504,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

"The {{construction}} of identity {{is such a}} complex layer rooted with so many implications, and I believe that my attempt with that piece was to open the conversation to that by saying that identity could be a tragedy.

Of merging ideas, merging of ethnicities, merging of traditions.... What I was trying to say is this is who I am".|$|R

[...] "Numb" [...] obtained moderate international chart success and peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Usher promoted for the Looking 4 Myself by performing in several shows; including the off-broadway show Fuerza Bruta: Look Up, Saturday Night Live and Good Morning America, among others.

[...] But in adapting the final two novels, the only instructions Maggs got from Adams was [...] "They don't need more than four episodes each." [...] Thus Maggs was able to use many of the major plot elements of the final two books (though not necessarily in the same order), and attempt to reconnect plot threads from all five radio series.|$|E

Who was I to complain?" [...] Kennan found the Yugoslav government treated the American diplomats politely, in contrast from {{the way in which the}} Russians treated him in Moscow. He wrote that the Yugoslavs [...] "considered me, rightly or wrongly, a distinguished person in the U.S., and they were pleased that someone whose name they had heard before was being sent to Belgrade".|$|E

500|$|The first {{biography}} on Busch, Über Wilhelm Busch und seine Bedeutung (About Wilhelm Busch and His Importance), {{was released}} in 1886. The publisher Eduard Daelen, also an artist and writer, echoed Busch's anti-Catholic bias, putting him on equal footing with Leonardo da Vinci, Peter Paul Rubens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and uncritically quoting correspondences. Even Busch {{and his friends were}} embarrassed. Literary scholar Friedrich Theodor Vischer attacked Daelen's biography and called him the [...] "envious eunuch of the desiccated Philistine". After reading this biography Johannes Proelß posted an essay in the Frankfurter Zeitung, which contained many biographical falsehoods— as a response to this, Busch wrote two articles in the same newspaper. Published in October and December 1886, the autobiographical essay Regarding <b>Myself</b> (<b>Was</b> Mich Betrifft) includes basic facts, and some description of his troubles; analysts see within the essay a deep identity crisis. Busch revised his autobiography over the following years. The last such essay was published under the title From Me About Me (Von mir über mich), which includes fewer biographical details and less reflection on bitterness and amusement than Regarding Myself.|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because I had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I <b>myself</b> <b>was</b> saying when I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E
500|$|While on hiatus {{between the}} release of his first EP Versus and Looking 4 Myself, Usher told AOL Music that he mainly {{traveled}} to various locations {{to listen to music}} which he [...] "felt was really significant in terms of energy." [...] Some of these locations included the Coachella Music Festival, Ibiza, Germany, Las Vegas, Miami and Southern France. He described some of the music as a [...] "little bit more electronic, some of it a little bit more dance. Some of it, a bit more world." [...] It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album's title track, with producer Rico Love, which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired, such as Diplo. Usher's intention for the album was one [...] "that was not genre-specific but just experimental". During an episode of NBC's The Voice, Usher called the album [...] "by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself". Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>was</b> chosen as the album's title as it described Usher's 'musical journey'.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, the Brewers renewed Braun's {{contract}} for $455,000, a $75,000 increase. Braun then signed an 8-year, $45–$51 million contract extension (the total depending on his [...] "Super 2" [...] service-time ranking after the 2009 season) on May 15, 2008. [...] The contract {{is through the}} year 2015. The deal included Braun's $455,000 salary for 2008, and a $2.3 million bonus in 2008. It could increase to $51 million through incentives. Braun also has a no-trade clause {{for the first four}} years, and then a limited no-trade clause allowing him to block deals to 12 teams from 2012 to 2013, and 6 teams from 2014 to 2015. The contract will keep Braun locked up through his age-31 season. It was the largest contract in Brewers' history, surpassing Jeff Suppan's. It was also the largest contract in baseball history given to a player with less than three years' experience. [...] Braun's agent, Nez Balelo, crunched enough numbers to show him what he potentially could have made over the life of this contract if he had chosen not to sign it. [...] "But the question I ultimately asked <b>myself</b> <b>was,</b> `What can't I buy with that amount of money?"' Braun said.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>was</b> released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E
