2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> I can’t cut them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lindemulder {{was arrested}} in May 2003 for assaulting husband Jesse James. James filed for a {{temporary}} restraining order and legal separation from Janine Lindemulder in May 2003, after she attacked him in their Seal Beach, California house. Janine became angry when she arrived back at the house and discovered Jesse loading her possessions into a truck. According to court documents, James said, [...] "She began screaming and yelling at me...and punching me. She punched <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> several times." [...] Jesse was unable to defend himself because his right arm had recently undergone surgery. According to court documents, by the time the police arrived, Lindemulder had already hit James {{in the back of the}} head with a flowerpot, and attacked him with a metal sculpture. James also claimed that Lindemulder punched him in the eye on February 13, 2003 - and attempted to run him over with a vehicle in May of that year.|$|E
2500|$|James Smith was an {{unemployed}} divorcé {{living in the}} Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as [...] "house-proud and well-groomed", he was a teetotaller and non-smoker. His marriage had ended after ten years in 1980 due to his violence towards his wife. He had then commenced an affair between 19801982 with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom he [...] "used as a punch-bag", even subjecting her to severe beatings while {{she was pregnant with}} his child. She said: [...] "At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But {{in the end it was}} every day. He would smack <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> or hit me over the head with an ashtray. He would kick me in the legs or between the legs." [...] Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. In 1982 Smith then began a relationship with 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, who was also a victim of his violence. In one attack he held her head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her.|$|E
60|$|He {{caught me}} by the arm, and looked <b>me</b> searchingly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|My {{mistress}} turned round {{from the}} piano, and looked <b>me</b> hard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|He came back, {{and stood}} still <b>in</b> front of <b>me,</b> looking <b>me</b> hard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Her tired {{eyes lit}} with a gleam {{of her former}} humor.|$|E
60|$|He {{rose from}} the table, came forward, took me by the shoulders, and looked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> smiling.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Her {{cheeks were}} flushed with walking, {{and the wind}} had blown her hair into {{becoming}} confusion.|$|E
60|$|If the man {{had come}} <b>in</b> and struck <b>me</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> I could have been no more surprised.|$|R
60|$|Though {{somewhat}} perturbed, I {{was struck}} by the phrase. And I lost sight of Nancy's generosity. She looked <b>me</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>me</b> {{straight}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> her colour {{a little}} heightened {{and with a}} sort of solemn ardour--if there was a little catch in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The cliff of our dreadful adventure?' she inquired, with a shudder. 'Death stares <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in {{the person}} of that cliff.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Answer me, Anna;--will you {{say that}} you will receive Lord Lovel as your {{accepted}} lover? Get up, girl, and look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Of what use is it to grovel there, while your spirit is in rebellion? Will you do this? Will you save us all from destruction, misery, and disgrace? Will you remember who you are;--what blood you have in your veins;--what name it is that you bear? Stand up, and look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> if you dare." ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. [Smiting his brow] How frightfully, horribly true! It {{has been}} staring <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> all my life; and I {{never saw it}} before.|$|E
60|$|Limping Lucy looked <b>me</b> hard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and {{saw that}} I was {{speaking}} the truth. Without a word more, she turned about again instantly towards Cobb's Hole.|$|R
60|$|Martina {{rested her}} {{elbows on the}} table and her chin upon her little hand, staring <b>me</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> with her quick eyes that pierced like nails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Johnny," [...] said Mrs. Medliker, setting {{her lips}} {{together}} as the door closed, [...] "look <b>me</b> right <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and say where you stole that gold." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Langerdale {{shook his}} head, and I {{noticed that he}} failed to look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> I braced myself up with a great effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly," [...] said Mr. Greene. And he at once {{extracted}} another sovereign, and tendered it to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of {{the assembled}} multitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} Florian is lying," [...] said Mr. Jones slowly; [...] "he {{does not look}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> {{and he does not}} lie straightforward." ...|$|E
60|$|We both rose. He looked <b>me</b> attentively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{with more}} {{appearance}} of interest {{than he had}} shown yet. I could see that I had perplexed him a little.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{pronounced}} the word [...] "disgraceful," [...] he suddenly looked <b>me</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> His eyes lightened up sternly, and the warning red spot rose on his pale cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do but sleep. [...] Have ye wept for me awhile? [...] Hush! I did but sleep. [...] I shall awake, my people! [...] I am not dead, nor can I ever die. [...] See, I {{have but}} slept! [...] See, I come again, made beautiful! [...] Have ye not seen <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of <b>the</b> children? [...] Have ye not heard <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{voices of the}} children? [...] Look on me now, the sleeper arisen; [...] Look on me, who wandered, whose name is the Dawning! [...] Why have ye mourned me, the sleeper awakened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Fred!" [...] she said, wildly, [...] "I {{wonder you}} can look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Where have you been all this time? Where have you been?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{it was you}} {{who stole}} these things. You know it, and you dare not deny it. Look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face!</b> Raise your sneak's eyes, and answer!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shameless woman!" [...] he said. [...] "Can {{you look}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in the {{presence}} of that man?" [...] He pointed, as he spoke, to Mr. Meeke.|$|E
60|$|For several minutes, {{although}} he looked <b>me</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> he said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum {{from the right}} to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look <b>me</b> {{straight}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> Mr. Lynx, {{and tell}} me that if I give you a handsome new tail, you will never boast about it or take undue pride in it,' said she.|$|R
60|$|She {{started to}} her feet; and walked close {{up to me}} of her own accord. Her eyes looked <b>me</b> searchingly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> as if to read {{something}} there which they had never read yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask you again," [...] he repeated, {{finding that}} she did not answer him, [...] "how dare you look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in the {{presence}} of that man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{it was you}} {{who stole}} these things. You know it, and you dare not deny it. Look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face!</b> Raise your sneak's eyes, and answer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear me {{you have}} {{run away from}} your last master," [...] said Sir Piercie, [...] "since you dare not look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> while you answer my question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's who it is," [...] {{answered}} Miss Port. [...] "She looked <b>me</b> square <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> as she dashed by. Not a {{word for}} you, not {{a word for}} me. Impudence! That doesn't express it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He stared <b>me</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> {{right into}} my eye (t'other one was patched, you know), and after {{standing}} stock-still {{with his mouth}} open, gave a step back, and then a step forward, and then screeched out, 'It's Brock!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is {{the same}} as sayin' that you've changed your mind about goin' out scoutin'?" [...] he cried sharply, looking <b>me</b> {{squarely}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "There is no reason why you should go if the job isn't to your likin'." ...|$|R
