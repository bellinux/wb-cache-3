25|$|In September 2006, Reid {{addressed}} Muslims in {{a run-down}} part of east London, warning them that fanatics {{were looking to}} groom and brainwash children for suicide bombings. During the speech he was confronted and barracked by Abu Izzadeen, also known as Omar or Trevor Brooks. <b>Mr</b> <b>Brooks</b> is {{a leader of the}} UK-banned Al Ghurabaa, an offshoot of the terrorist-supporting Al-Muhajiroun – a man who many accuse of glorifying terrorism and inciting racial hatred during nightly conversations (often using the nom de plume Abu Baraa) on a New York-based chatroom service.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{lasted from}} February 8 to May 6, 1995. Shooting {{on location in}} Philadelphia and Baltimore (including the Senator Theatre) in winter was fraught with weather problems. There were also technical glitches with the futuristic mechanical props. Because the film has a nonlinear storyline, continuity errors occurred, and some scenes had to be reshot. Gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding. Despite setbacks, however, the director managed {{to stay within the}} budget and was only a week behind his shooting schedule. [...] "It was a tough shoot", acknowledged Jeffrey Beecroft (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks,</b> Dances with Wolves), the production designer. [...] "There wasn't a lot of money or enough time. Terry is a perfectionist, but he was really adamant about not going over budget. He got crucified for Munchausen, and that still haunts him." ...|$|E

60|$|It has {{not been}} {{mentioned}} that at the fête at <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook's</b> on the memorable occasion of the Black Feast, Mr. Merton and his daughter were staying as guests with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Merton was much struck with the extraordinary improvement which {{had taken place in}} the bearing and appearance of the young people.|$|R

6000|$|The two {{inspectors}} {{bent over}} the table and examined the plans, asking a question of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook</b> now and then. Jack had turned to leave when his employer ceased to speak to him, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook</b> made a motion to him to stay. [...] "What {{is the size of}} your furnace, Mr. Brook?" [...] asked Mr. Hardinge.|$|R
2500|$|The {{building}} development {{fell through}} and the lease of the Antelope Ground {{was taken by}} a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> (or Brooke), with cricket matches involving the [...] "Gentlemen of South Hampshire" [...] being staged there.|$|E
2500|$|In many cases, sketch {{dialogue}} was {{not even}} written down, but simply indicated by describing a scene, as in, [...] "Sid does man coming home from business mad." [...] Sometimes, said Larry Gelbart, it was [...] "organized chaos," [...] and when watching the writers create from offstage, felt, [...] "...it was a religious experience." [...] To Mel Brooks, [...] "it was a zoo. Everyone pitched lines at Sid. Jokes would be changed fifty times." [...] Naturally there were some explosive episodes: [...] "Mr. Caesar once dangled a terrified <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> from an 18th-story window until colleagues restrained him. With one punch, he knocked out a horse that had thrown his wife off its back, a scene that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> replayed in his movie Blazing Saddles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brooks's tale of easy credit, {{inflated}} egos, financial {{greed and}} {{the end of an era}} symbolized by broker Whitney came to be seen as one of the best accounts of the conditions which led to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. [...] "As <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> tells this tale of dishonor, desperation, and the fall of the mighty, it takes on overtones of Greek tragedy, a king brought down by pride. Whitney's sordid history has been told before", said The Wall Street Journal in its review. [...] "But in Mr. Brooks's hands, the drama becomes freshly shocking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook,</b> [...] "the whole question, don't you know? of {{bringing}} girls forward or not. The question of--well, {{what do you}} call it?--their exposure. It's THE question, it appears--the question--of the future; it's awfully interesting and the Duchess at any rate is great on it. Nanda of course is exposed," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook</b> pursued--"fearfully." ...|$|R

2500|$|Brooks's {{subsequent}} work, The Takeover Game, limned the precincts of the greenmailers {{and junk}} bond pioneers of the 1980s. The book, noted Business Weeks editor-in-chief Stephen B. Shepard in his New York Times review, managed [...] "to be both scholarly and provocative." [...] With his facile explanations of complex financial terms and invigorating portraits of market speculators, The Takeover Game [...] "argues that the investment banks, motivated by huge fees, are {{the driving force}} behind the current merger mania usually to the detriment of the commonweal. It is little more than a speculative frenzy reminiscent of the 1920s, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> believes, built on high-risk debt euphemistically called leverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good you mean the kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, it sounds as if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|... "I am honored that my 'Emerson' {{has been}} chosen as this year's {{recipient}} of the Warren-Brooks Award," [...] Buell said. [...] "I also confess to being somewhat bemused and surprised," [...] he added, [...] "that a book about a New England icon toward whom both Mr. Warren and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> felt distinctly ambivalent would be honored in their name, especially considering that only one of its seven chapters is exclusively devoted to Emerson's accomplishment as a creative writer. So for that particular book to be awarded this prize in particular seems deliciously ironic." [...] Buell added, [...] "On the other hand, Emerson always aspired to be a poet first and foremost, and it's no less true that Brooks and Warren were my own first and foremost instructors {{in the art of}} reading literary texts. I take the judge's verdict as heartening evidence that Emerson did not aspire in vain, and that my early training somehow managed to stick." ...|$|E
60|$|Tess {{had spoken}} to her husband from the doorway, without {{entering}} the dining-room, and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Brooks,</b> who stood within the partly-closed door of her own sitting-room {{at the back of}} the passage, could hear fragments of the conversation--if conversation it could be called--between those two wretched souls. She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door behind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Brooks</b> knew that Tess had re-entered her apartment. As the young lady was not fully dressed, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Brooks</b> knew that she would not emerge again for some time.|$|R
6000|$|The {{response}} {{had been}} prompt, yet Mr. Longdon seemed suddenly {{to show that}} he suspected the superficial. [...] "Unless it's with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook</b> you're in love." [...] Then on his friend's taking the idea with a mere headshake of negation, a repudiation that might even have astonished by its own lack of surprise, [...] "Or unless <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook's</b> in love with you," [...] he amended.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] said Mr. Dodgson, [...] "they might be injured by stones. My dear, do you lead the girls back to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook's.</b> The house will hardly be shut up yet, {{and even if}} it is, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brook</b> will gladly receive you.

6000|$|Mr. Mitchett was there, and, anticipating <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook</b> in {{receiving}} him, her companion passed it straighten. [...] "She's magnificent!" ...|$|R

6000|$|They were soft pretty {{eyes when}} opened, {{in spite of}} their heavy red lids, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks</b> thought that Santa Ana would be no worse if they {{remained}} open. Possibly he looked it, for Mrs. Wade said hurriedly, [...] "I mean--that is--I've been thinking that life needn't ALWAYS be as gloomy as we make it here. And even HERE, you know, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brooks,</b> we have six months' sunshine--though we always forget it in the rainy season." ...|$|E

60|$|Vanderbank, who, beside <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook,</b> {{looked at}} him with attention, might have {{suspected}} him of turning a trifle pale; though even Vanderbank, with reasons of his own for an observation of the sharpest, could scarce have read into the matter the particular dim vision that would have accounted for it--the flicker of fear of what <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook,</b> whether as daughter or as mother, was at last so strangely and differently to show herself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brook</b> gloomily thought. [...] "No, no--I've had my calmness: the calmness of deep despair. I've {{seemed to}} see {{everything}} go." ...|$|R
