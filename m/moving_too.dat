5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Loretta {{gradually}} becomes {{good friends}} with Nancy and Hannah. When Nancy's abusive ex-husband Jake Dean, who tried to rape her and kill his and his ex-wife Becca's son Charlie (Joshua McConville), returns to the village Loretta consoles Nancy and moves in with her. Loretta grows close to Jake and, although initially hesitant, forms a relationship with him. After Jake and Loretta go public, Loretta is kicked out by Nancy and moves in with Jake. When Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) suggests the pair are <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> quickly Loretta agrees, she talks to Jake who gets angry showing his temper to Loretta for the first time. The couple reconcile {{with the help of}} Steph. Loretta strikes up a friendship with Holly Hutchinson (Lydia Waters) who aspires to be a dancer like Loretta after feeling unnoticed by her mother Cindy. As they bond Loretta gives Holly advice on dancing. Loretta faces prejudice when she starts applying for new jobs, as no one will employ her due to her previous jobs as a stripper. She later lies during an interview, her interviewers discover her previous employment and make derogatory remarks to her.|$|E

25|$|Deng Xiaoping disliked {{all three}} leaders, and {{directed}} Hu to dismiss {{them from the}} Party in order to silence them, but Hu refused. In January 1987, {{after two weeks of}} student protests demanding greater Western-style freedoms, a clique of Party elders and senior military officials forced Hu to resign on the grounds that he had been too lenient with student protesters and for <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> quickly towards free market-style economic reforms.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E

25|$|In March 1806, a split {{developed}} in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally John Randolph who viciously accused President Jefferson {{on the floor of}} the House of <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart politically from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British actions against American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20 million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.|$|E
25|$|Rosecrans {{once again}} {{found that he}} was a hero in the Northern press. On October 24, he was given command of XIV Corps (which, because he was also given command of the Department of the Cumberland, would soon be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), {{replacing}} the ineffectual Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who had just fought the inconclusive Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, against Gen. Braxton Bragg, but was accused of <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> cautiously. Rosecrans was promoted to the rank of major general (of volunteers, as opposed to his brigadier rank in the regular army). The promotion was applied retroactive to March 21, 1862, so that he would outrank fellow Maj. Gen. Thomas; Thomas had earlier been offered Buell's command, but turned down the opportunity {{out of a sense of}} personal loyalty. Grant was not unhappy that Rosecrans was leaving his command.|$|E
25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> far to the left and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E

25|$|Mark {{takes over}} running the family fruit and {{vegetable}} stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant {{to tell her about}} his HIV status. Whilst on a trip to Amsterdam, Shelley makes it clear to Mark that she wants to sleep with him, forcing him to admit his HIV status. Shelley is furious that he did not think to tell her this before and tells him she never wants to see him again. Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her. When this doesn't work, she threatens to tell everyone about his HIV status, but leaves Walford when her bluff doesn't work.|$|E
25|$|Kepford's {{next big}} day arrived on 19 February. VF-17 was {{assigned}} fighter escort duty, shepherding single engine bombers to strikes on Lakunai Airfield. Kepford was again assigned as division leader, {{this time for}} one of two groups flying high cover. His wingman had engine problems and was quickly forced to return to Piva. Arriving at the target site, Kepford decided there was enough fighter cover {{and that he was}} too vulnerable without a wingman, so he too headed back for home base. En route, he spotted a Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable float plane and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried to lose them flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E
500|$|After the war ended, Compton {{resigned}} {{his chair}} as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago {{and returned to}} Washington University in St. Louis, where [...] he was inaugurated as the university's ninth Chancellor in 1946. During Compton's time as Chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton's accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> slowly toward full racial integration, making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to African Americans.|$|E

500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge were {{considered}} to be pre-race favourites. [...] Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station. [...] After a poor start, which Oxford's cox Chick referred to as [...] "a bit ropey", Cambridge took an early lead and were five seconds ahead at the Mile Post. [...] They extended their advantage to eight seconds by Hammersmith Bridge and sixteen by Chiswick Steps. [...] Poor steering from Haycock combined with determination from Oxford to stay in touch kept the Cambridge from <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> much further ahead; [...] the Light Blues passed the finishing post in 18 minutes and 9 seconds, six-and-a-half lengths and 20 seconds ahead of the Dark Blues. It was Cambridge's first back-to-back victory since 1973. [...] The race was umpired by former Cambridge Blue John Garrett.|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends.

[...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me.

500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where {{something}} [...] "doesn't have to happen... every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E

500|$|After the election, the {{administration}} of President Woodrow Wilson appointed Roosevelt to be Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt brought Howe with him as his chief of staff. Though previously ignorant on naval matters, Howe studied diligently and was soon considered an expert. Through patronage positions and the hosting of visiting state officials, Howe and Roosevelt also began to build a national network of Democratic supporters to support an eventual presidential run. Howe also helped Roosevelt make connections with labor leaders by encouraging Roosevelt to personally inspect work conditions and meet with workers. In 1914, Howe managed a brief Roosevelt campaign for the US Senate, but Roosevelt was easily defeated by Tammany candidate James W. Gerard in the Democratic primary. Howe {{appears to have been}} opposed to Roosevelt's run for the Senate, feeling that Roosevelt was <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> fast; Howe described his role as [...] "to provide the toe weights" [...] to slow down the ambitious younger man. In 1918, the relationship between Howe and Roosevelt became briefly strained when the Roosevelts' marriage nearly ended over Franklin's affair with his wife Eleanor's secretary, Lucy Mercer; a divorce would have meant the end of Franklin's political career, and therefore Howe's as well.|$|E
