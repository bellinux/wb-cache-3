25|$|During {{training}}, conscripts woke {{up between}} 5-6 am and training lasted for 10-12 {{six days of}} the week. Much of the training was done by rote and consisted of instruction. Before 1941 training had lasted for six months, but after the war, training was shorted to a few weeks. After finishing training, all men {{had to take the}} Oath of the Red Army which read: I______, a citizen of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, entering into the ranks of the Red Army of the Workers and Peasants', take this oath and solemnly promise to be a honest, brave, disciplined, vigilant fighter, staunchly to protect military and state secrets, and unquestioningly to obey all military regulations and orders of commanders and superiors.I promise conscientiously to study military affairs, in every way to protect state secrets and state property, and to my last breath to be faithful to the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government.I am always prepared on order of the Workers and Peasants Government to rise to the defense of my Motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and as a fighting man of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants', I promise to defend it bravely, skillfully, with dignity and honor, sparing neither <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> nor my life itself for the achievement of total victory over our enemies.If by evil intent I should violate this, my solemn oath, then let the severe punishment of Soviet law and the total hatred and contempt of the working classes befall me. Tactics were based on the 1936 training manual and the revised edition of 1942. Small unit movements and how to build defensive positions were laid out in a manner that was easy to understand and memorize. The manuals had the force of law and violations of the manuals were legal offenses. Soviet tactics always had the platoons attacking in the same way with the platoons usually broke into four sections occupying about 100 yards on average. The only complex formation was the diamond formation with one section advancing, two behind and one in the rear. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the Red Army did not engage in leap-frogging of sections with one section providing fire support to the sections that were advancing, and instead all of the sections and platoons attacked en masse. The other only variation was for the sections to “seep” into a position by infiltration.|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) {{were said to}} be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, {{speaking}} in the House of Commons, Princess Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, [...] "I would shed the last drop of <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> for my niece." [...] The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that the Duke intended to murder Princess Victoria and take the British Throne for himself.|$|E

500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you <b>my</b> <b>blood,</b> my honor, my life").|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in <b>my</b> <b>blood.</b> My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in <b>my</b> <b>blood,</b> Lord Jesus– I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins– I love her, and I want to be hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake.

500|$|Wagner {{announced}} the first Bayreuth Festival for 1873, at which his full Ring cycle would be performed. Aware of the honour {{that such an}} event would bring to the town, the local council donated a large plot of land—the [...] "Green Hill"—overlooking the town, as a site for the theatre. [...] Since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the initial festival was deferred. By the spring of 1873 {{only a third of}} the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the entire project on the verge of collapse, the king relented and provided a loan. The full building programme included a handsome villa, [...] "Wahnfried", into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874. [...] The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building Wagner remarked to Cosima: [...] "Each stone is red with <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> and yours".|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} few months, Pedro {{attempted}} to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the Cortes would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. [...] "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he [...] "required no more time for decision than {{the reading of the}} letters demanded." [...] Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wished to enslave and persecute us.
