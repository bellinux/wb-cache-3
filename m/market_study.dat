EV1 lessees were officially participants in a [...] "real-world engineering evaluation" [...] and <b>market</b> <b>study</b> into the feasibility of producing and marketing a commuter electric vehicle in select U.S. markets undertaken by GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group. The cars were not available for purchase, and could be serviced only at designated Saturn dealerships. Within a year of the EV1's release, leasing programs were also launched in San Francisco and Sacramento, California, along with a limited program {{in the state of}} Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|Irkut and EADS {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding in May 2002 to jointly carry out a <b>market</b> <b>study</b> and to define the conditions and costs of international certification and the logistics of setting up a worldwide after-sales service. The study was completed in July 2003, revealing a potential market for up to 320 aircraft over 20 years. The two companies, with Rolls-Royce Deutschland, planned to obtain Western certification during 2008/9 and offer a Rolls-Royce BR715 powered aircraft for Western markets. This version was {{to be given the}} designation Be-200RR. The original Be-200 prototype (RF-21511) was earmarked to be converted into the Be-200RR prototype. [...] However, little progress toward a Rolls-Royce version has been made since a joint study concluded in 2004 that because the intended BR715 engine would require extensive redevelopment due to weight and salt-water corrosion issues, break-even would require sales of too many aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined Exxon's {{task force}} which {{was looking for}} {{projects}} 30 {{years in the future}} and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time. The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a <b>market</b> <b>study</b> and concluded that a price per watt of about $20/watt would create significant demand. The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a printed circuit board on the back, acrylic plastic on the front, and silicone glue between the two, [...] "potting" [...] the cells. Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced Tideland Signal to use its panels to power navigational buoys, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
