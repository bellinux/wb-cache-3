5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the millennium, Attenborough's {{authored}} documentaries were adopting a more overtly environmentalist stance. In State of the Planet (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists {{to assess the impact of}} man's activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of global warming (The Truth about Climate Change, 2006) and human population growth (How <b>Many</b> <b>People</b> <b>Can</b> Live on Planet Earth?, 2009).

25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E

Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil {{ceremony}} on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends {{until his death in}} 1960. In 1949 she married actor Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003; she asserted that [...] "We had the perfect relationship. Not <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> say that." [...] She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter and Deirdre Ann. While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation.

500|$|On xx, Croft and Sim {{touched on}} themes of love, desire, and loss in their songwriting, which Croft said has [...] "always been based around emotions, {{right from the}} start. My {{favourite}} songs are usually quite sad and I think heartbreak is something that so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> connect with." [...] Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran [...] "a bit higher". Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and [...] "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on [...] "VCR", the yearning expressed on [...] "Heart Skipped a Beat", and the premature affection warned of on [...] "Crystalised". Petra Davis from The Quietus argued that the thematic crux of xx was in the succession of songs from [...] "Islands" [...] to [...] "Shelter", each of which saw [...] "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} several songs relate to Duff's {{experiences}} between the releases of Hilary Duff and Dignity. The songs [...] "Stranger" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Woman", despite speculation {{that they were}} written about Madden's then-new girlfriend Nicole Richie, were actually written about Duff's father's affair. She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom must feel around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it seem like {{it was about a}} relationship I was in, because I didn't want people to know about my parents. But I've realized that so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate to what I've gone through." [...] The album's title track has also been reported to be about Richie, though Duff did not deny rumors that it was. [...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely about people in Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E

2500|$|... "Whereas the Panopticon renders {{many people}} visible {{to a few}} and enables power to be {{exercised}} over the many by subjecting them {{to a state of}} permanent visibility, the development of communication media provides a means by which <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> gather information about a few and, at the same time, a few can appear before many; thanks to the media, it is primarily those who exercise power, rather than those over whom power is exercised, who are subjected to a certain kind of visibility".|$|E
2500|$|It is rude to call {{a person}} by his/hers surname in the {{presence}} of unknown people.

2500|$|Hartwig Vens {{argues that}} hip hop {{can also be}} viewed as a global {{learning}} experience.

[...] He also adds: [...] "Thousands of organizers from Cape Town to Paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice, policing and prisons, media justice, and education.". While hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music {{from the rest of the}} world, a musical [...] "cross pollination" [...] has taken place, which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities. Hip hop's messages allow the under-privileged and the mistreated to be heard. These cultural translations cross borders. While the music may be from a foreign country, the message is something that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate to- something not [...] "foreign" [...] at all.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{heaviest}} snow {{was confined to}} a fairly small, but very heavily populated area, the storm was only ranked as a low-end Category3 (Major) on the new Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, which {{takes into account the}} area and population affected, as well as snowfall accumulations. [...] This indirectly also reflects the fact that casualties were extremely low and cleanup was fairly quick, even in the New York City area where the record snow amounts occurred. [...] The main reasons for this are: A) The storm fell on a Sunday when <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> more easily stay home, B) the relatively small geographic area of extremely large snowfall, and C) Because the temperature was well below freezing throughout most of the storm, the snow was mostly dry and light in composition, as opposed to the wet and heavy snows that make some otherwise lesser storms much harder to clean up from and are more common at least in the coastal Northeast. Additionally, temperatures {{in the days after the}} storm were unseasonably warm in some spots (reaching the mid-50s °F in hard-hit New York City, and the mid 60s in DC) which helped melt the snow much more quickly than usual.|$|E
2500|$|For most people, {{irritation}} from formaldehyde {{is temporary}} and reversible, though formaldehyde can cause allergies and {{is part of}} the standard patch test series. In 2005–06, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). [...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from permanent press finished clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.|$|E
