5|$|The Xerxes {{exists in}} four {{distinct}} versions. The original two-plinth Xerxes (1985) was discontinued after about eight years' production, after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) was launched. On the 10th {{anniversary of the}} company (1995), Roksan reprised the entry-level Xerxes turntable with a 3-plinth design named Xerxes.X. Its top plinth houses the tonearm and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing,</b> and is isolated from the base by five Blobs, which also allow the plinth to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and <b>main</b> <b>bearing.</b> The motor is driven by XPS V Reference motor drive, which receives power from DS1.5 Reference Power Supply.|$|E
5|$|Like the LP12, the Xerxes has a two-piece platter–sub-platter {{configuration}} {{on which}} sits a thin felt mat. And while the LP12's platters {{are made of}} mazak, the Xerxes' platters are of aluminium. The outer platter is rigid and peripherally weighted. However, the Roksan's outer platter weighs {{less than half of}} that of the LP12, to reduce load on the <b>main</b> <b>bearing,</b> yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes.20 which {{superseded}} the Xerxes.X in 2005 incorporated new <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> {{ball and}} the new Rmat-5 sub-plinth. The bearing, attached to the inner platter, has an unusually small-diameter hardened-steel spindle, which sits {{on top of a}} tungsten ball that measures 2mm and is machined to a tolerance in the order of micrometres. The corresponding housing is made of bronze. The two-piece platter, when fit together, are snug and will not resonate.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{positions}} of the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> must be between individual cylinders (L4 with 5 <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> or L6 with 7 <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> - only one rod journal between <b>main</b> <b>bearings),</b> or between adjacent pairs of cylinders (L4 with 3 <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> L6 or V6 with 4 <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> or V8 with 5 <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> - two rod journals between <b>main</b> <b>bearings).</b>|$|R
50|$|Honda straight-twin engines, {{which began}} {{appearing}} in the late 1950s, had four <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Subsequent engines had four or occasionally three <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> ball bearings being better than shell bearings for this engine configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The Speed Twenty’s 2½-litre, 2.8-litre or 3½-litre engines {{with four}} <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{replaced}} in the 4.3-litre and 3½-litre Speed Twenty-Five with a strengthened new designed six-cylinder in-line unit now with seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted from the <b>main</b> <b>bearing,</b> thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses a spindle {{that allows the}} user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> web {{area was}} thicker in the 390, 401 and SR blocks, thick enough that two {{additional}} bearing cap bolt holes could be {{drilled and tapped}} for an aftermarket four bolt main cap, providing a stronger bottom end. AMC never built a factory four bolt main block, they sold aftermarket four bolt main caps through their Group 19 performance parts program.|$|E
25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin {{walls in the}} lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> crankshafts to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and wheel hubs were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the rear wheel hubs, the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|E
500|$|The bearing-mounted {{spring-loaded}} motor {{is powered}} by an outboard power supply designated the XPS. Its basic power supply switchable between 33 and 45 rpm. Throughout the years, {{there have been many}} changes which have significantly improved this table. The earliest and most important of these was a new <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> (...) [...] Other changes include modifications to components such as the outboard power supply, now in its seventh version, and the suspension blobs.|$|E
500|$|The {{first run}} of engine R1 {{took place at}} Rolls-Royce's Derby factory on 7 April 1929 with R7 running the next day. Many {{mechanical}} failures were experienced during bench testing including burnt valves, connecting rod breakages and <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> seizures, while considerably more trouble than expected occurred with valve springs; at one time two or three would be found broken after a 10-minute run, but the continual redesigning and testing of components reduced all these problems. Unknown to Royce himself, the engineers had also fitted [...] "Wellworthy" [...] pistons that were better able to withstand the 13tons [...] "pressure" [...] of each firing stroke.|$|E

50|$|It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, {{inclined}} at 49 degrees, with {{an unusual}} float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings {{were used for the}} big end bearings and the centre <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> The outer <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers.|$|R
50|$|Engine blocks: {{produced}} in four- and five-cylinder versions, they have similar specs. They are cast iron, with five <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> {{for the four}} cylinder versions and six <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> for the five cylinder versions, and can withstand turbocharging. Some versions have counter-rotating balance shafts to reduce vibrations. The aluminium pistons have graphite skirts to reduce internal engine friction, providing more reliability and efficiency.|$|R
500|$|The {{engine was}} disk shaped and its intake was {{positioned}} in the middle, which meant the engine air intakes {{had to be}} located near {{the middle of the}} wing. In the Ace design, these were located just {{to the front of the}} centre on the top and bottom of the aircraft. The cockpit was positioned over the <b>main</b> <b>bearing,</b> behind the intakes. A [...] "spine" [...] on the top and bottom ran from the cockpit area to the rear edge of the aircraft. Several other versions of the basic layout were also studied, including the [...] "Omega" [...] which was more disk-like as it cut away the rear portions of the delta wing as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Xerxes {{design is}} deliberately {{a radical departure}} from the traditional suspended sub-chassis design. Instead of having a three-point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub-chassis, the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber [...] "Blobs". The top plinth sees mountings for the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> and tonearm. A hole is cut out from the top board for the motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on the board below. On the lower board, to which an outer surround is attached, three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable's chosen placement. One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C-shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the tonearm area. However, the cut-out is prone to a commonly observed [...] "plinth sag", where the part of it would bend out of true {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E
500|$|On July 13, 1944, the {{day that}} the E. A. Bryan docked at Port Chicago, the ship's [...] winch brakes were found stuck in the [...] "off" [...] position, meaning that the winch could be {{operated}} freely, but lacked the critical stopping capability if steam pressure was interrupted. The ship's chief mate and chief engineer were called to examine the winch but it was never determined whether the brake was made operational. During loading operations on July 15 the winch at [...] hold began making a hammering noise. A steady application of grease quieted it through the night until its <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> could be replaced the next morning on July 16. On the afternoon of July 17, a bleeder valve on winch [...] required immediate repair. Albert Carr, a civil service plumber from Pittsburg, California, was called to replace it; it was his first day at Port Chicago. Carr pulled a broken nipple out of the bleeder valve and replaced both the nipple and the valve from new stock taken from Port Chicago's shop. While at work he witnessed a man accidentally drop a naval artillery shell two feet onto the wooden pier but there was no detonation. Carr waited until the African-American winch operator tested the newly repaired winch then hurriedly left the pier, thinking that the whole operation appeared unsafe.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the blade-pitch fault and {{emergency}} shutdown on drivetrain responses in a 5 -MW bottom-fixed wind turbine are investigated. A 5 -MW reference gearbox with 4 -point support is employed and the decoupled analysis approach is used for the load effect analysis. The effect of this fault event is then investigated for all bearings and gears inside the gearbox as well as <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> The results show that the blade-pitch fault creates significant axial forces on <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> which increases the nontorque force entering the gearbox. Due to the emergency shutdown, the rotor torque reversal occurs which causes force reversals in gears. The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> are more affected than gears and bearings inside the gearbox in this fault condition and emergency shutdown, but first-stage bearings may also be considerably affected. It is therefore recommended to conduct a thorough inspection of <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and first stage bearings in case of such blade-pitch fault condition and emergency shutdown...|$|R
50|$|The engines {{built from}} 1932 to 1935 had poured <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> which {{required}} skill and machine shop equipment to overhaul. Part of the 1936 production and all production from 1937 {{to the end}} of flathead V8 production had both replaceable shell <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and connecting rod inserts (unlike the contemporary GM products), enabling straightforward and low cost rebuilding, another reason why the Ford was a favorite of amateur mechanics.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: eight-cylinder V-type {{air-cooled}} engine 8 ChVN 15 / 16.

500|$|The early A1 Pacifics were a {{match for}} the {{performances}} demanded {{of them in the}} early 1920s. They were certainly able to take loads single-handed that were beyond the capacity of their Atlantic predecessors as was shown in a test run made by 1471 when it took a 20-coach train weighing [...] over the [...] from London to Grantham at an average speed of [...] However this was at the cost of heavy coal consumption, and general performance was well below the ultimate potential of the design. This was largely due to a regression from the earlier 3-cylinder 2-6-0 design, which was the first to have the standard Gresley conjugated motion combined with long valve travel. [...] However, practical problems were experienced with components quickly suffering from premature wear, especially in the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> of the large 2:1 lever which had not yet been fitted with the very necessary ball race; excessive 'play' led to so much over-travel of the middle valve, that it began to hit the end-covers. In order to prevent this, when applying the gear to the Pacifics, Gresley fell back on the expedient of shortening valve travel even though that choked the exhaust at speed, was responsible for the heavy coal consumption, and negated most of the advantages gained by the locomotive's revolutionary design. However, by incorporating the Great Western-inspired valve modifications, the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that were previously impossible.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E
