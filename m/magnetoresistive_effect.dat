50|$|Tunnel {{magnetoresistance}} (TMR) is a <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> {{that occurs}} in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), which is a component consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator. If the insulating layer is thin enough (typically a few nanometers), electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet into the other.

50|$|The first <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> was {{discovered}} by William Thomson (better known as Lord Kelvin) in 1851, but {{he was unable to}} lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5%. Nowadays, systems are known (e.g. semimetals or concentric ring EMR structures) where a magnetic field can change resistance by orders of magnitude. As the resistance may depend on magnetic field through various mechanisms, it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on magnetic field directly (e.g. geometric magnetoresistance, multiband magnetoresistance) and those where it does so indirectly through magnetisation (e.g. AMR, TMR).|$|E
5000|$|A {{write head}} magnetises a region by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise {{the region and}} to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [...] "giant" [...] magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm.

5000|$|A spin valve is a device, {{consisting}} {{of two or more}} conducting magnetic materials, whose electrical resistance can change between two values depending on the relative alignment of the magnetisation in the layers. The resistance change {{is a result of the}} Giant <b>Magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect.</b> The magnetic layers of the device align [...] "up" [...] or [...] "down" [...] depending on an external magnetic field. In the simplest case, a spin valve consists of a non-magnetic material sandwiched between two ferromagnets, one of which is fixed (pinned) by an antiferromagnet which acts to raise its magnetic coercivity and behaves as a [...] "hard" [...] layer, while the other is free (unpinned) and behaves as a [...] "soft" [...] layer. Due to the difference in coercivity, the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one. Upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength, the soft layer switches polarity, producing two distinct states: a parallel, low-resistance state, and an antiparallel, high-resistance state.|$|E
50|$|A {{magneto-resistor}} (MR) is a two terminal device which {{changes its}} resistance parabolically with applied magnetic field. This {{variation of the}} resistance of MR due to the magnetic field {{is known as the}} <b>Magnetoresistive</b> <b>Effect.</b> It is possible to build structures in which the electrical resistance varies as a function of applied magnetic field. These structures can be used as magnetic sensors. Normally these resistors are assembled in a bridge configuration to compensate for thermal drift. Popular magneto resistance-based sensors are: Anisotropic Magneto Resistance (AMR), Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR), Giant Magneto Impendence (GMI) and Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR). All these MR-based sensors have higher sensitivity compared to Halleffect sensors. Despite of this, these sensors (GMR, CMR, and TMR) are still more expensive than Hall-effect devices, have serious drawbacks related with nonlinear behavior, distinct thermal drift, and a very strong external field can permanently alter the sensor behavior (GMR). GMI and TMR sensors are even more sensitive than GMR based sensors, but still in the test phase and no commercial version are available today.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{is written}} to the cells {{using a variety of}} means. In the {{simplest}} [...] "classic" [...] design, each cell lies between a pair of write lines arranged at right angles to each other, parallel to the cell, one above and one below the cell. When current is passed through them, an induced magnetic field is created at the junction, which the writable plate picks up. This pattern of operation is similar to core memory, a system commonly used in the 1960s. This approach requires a fairly substantial current to generate the field, however, which makes it less interesting for low-power uses, one of MRAM's primary disadvantages. Additionally, as the device is scaled down in size, {{there comes a time when}} the induced field overlaps adjacent cells over a small area, leading to potential false writes. This problem, the half-select (or write disturb) problem, appears to set a fairly large minimum size for this type of cell. One experimental solution to this problem was to use circular domains written and read using the giant <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect,</b> but it appears this line of research is no longer active.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the magnetoresistive {{properties}} of n–Si/SiO 2 /Ni, nanostructures containing nanogranular nickel rods in a SiO 2 layer’s vertical pores substantially differ from the similar properties in the earlier studied nanogranular Ni films electrodeposited onto the n–Si plates. From {{the point of view}} of the electrophysical properties, the nanostructures studied are analogous to a system of two Schottky Si/Ni diodes, which are connected to each other. The magnetoresistance of such structures has been studied in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K and the magnetic field range of up to 8 Tl. It is established that at temperatures of 17 – 27 K the structures possess a positive <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>effect,</b> whose value depends on the transverse voltage applied to the structure and increases with a decrease in the longitudinal (along the rods) current intensity. At a current of 100 nA, the relative magnetoresistance in the field of 8 Tl increases from 500 to 35000 % by an increase in the transverse voltage from 0 to – 2 V.
