5000|$|Verneur Pratt, {{inventor}} of the <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> lived in the Keeler-Pratt House in the 1920s. His laboratory and studio was the 1876 carriage barn on the property.|$|E
50|$|Pratt {{invented the}} Optigraph an early <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader.</b> This {{development}} {{led to the}} formation of the International Filmbook company to manufacture and sell microfilm reading equipment. An innovative approach to film reading was the use of cassettes that allowed for rotating the viewof the film. Unfortunately, the expense of this innovation led to the bankruptcy of International Filmbook.|$|E
5000|$|The 7,200-square-foot library has a {{collection}} of over 40,992 in house items. The library also has a growing local digital history collection of books, photographs, and historical documents of local importance. The library building includes computers, printers, a fax machine, copiers, a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> and a mobile learning lab for computer classes. Wi-fi is also available throughout the building.|$|E

50|$|The section {{contains}} <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>microfilm</b> reader/printers, TV and VCR equipment {{with more}} than 600 video films available. An LCD TV has been provided in the section {{by courtesy of the}} Punjab Library Foundation.|$|R
50|$|The library {{provides}} {{services such}} as lending of books, reference and bibliographic service, reprographic service. It has <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> audio-video systems, slide projector and public address system.|$|R
50|$|Historians, {{students}} {{and all those}} looking for their family tree, who are searching for Skiatook's past can view the personal papers, documents and photographs of the town's pioneer families, events and places at the museum. Also provided is a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> to enable visitors to research into newspapers dating back to April 1905, the date the first newspaper in town began publishing.|$|E
50|$|The library has a {{computer}} lab and homework center, a copy machine, a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> printer and a microfche reader printer. Prueter Library has books in Spanish for {{both children and}} adults. Because the library is {{in the home of}} the navy base, the library makes an effort to collect materials about Port Hueneme, the Seabees, and the U.S. Navy.|$|E
50|$|The kibbutz has {{a number}} of factories; one of the oldest is Microvue which {{produces}} microfilm readers/scanners, mostly for export. Microvue {{is one of the few}} <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> manufacturers left in the world. Sheletron, founded in 1996, produces electronic display solutions through text, pictures, video, and animation on LCD screens. Remote control of the displays is possible through unique software developed in the company development centre.|$|E
5000|$|El Paso Times on Microfilm: The Border Heritage Center has <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> and {{printers}} for archived El Paso Times newspaper articles. For {{those who}} cannot visit the library, the Center provides mail services.|$|R
50|$|The library {{offers a}} wide variety of {{services}} which includes lamination, <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> fax service, online catalogs, magnifying readers, free Wi-Fi throughout the building, and a drive-up book drop. The library provides federal and state tax forms.|$|R
50|$|ADI {{early on}} worked toward the {{development}} of <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> and cameras. Their first microfilm laboratories were located in the U.S.Department of Agriculture Library in Washington, DC and the Institute distributed materials through the newly created Bibliofilm Service.|$|R
5000|$|To {{accommodate}} {{readers who}} did not have access to a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> Bails offered a reproduction service of [...] "cover photographs, spanning most of the key #1 issues from the World War II era," [...] in black & white for $2. These reproductions pre-dated by three decades the four volumes of comic book covers published as The Photo-Journal Guide to Comic Books by Ernie Gerber in the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|Microform is a {{reasonable}} option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, {{so long as it}} is stored in proper conditions and a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> is accessible. Even microfiche is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides.|$|E
5000|$|It adds: [...] "On other {{shelves of}} this library, one {{can learn a}} whole vast amount of {{interesting}} tid-bits about Goa.... XCHR's book collection has been steadily growing. From 1993 to 1995, for instance, it grew from 13,000 to 16,000.... Computer printouts of the indexes of XCHR are available, while {{there is also a}} <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> on hand. In keeping with the wealth of information this centre contains, even the prestigious US Library of Congress has evinced interest inits information." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{lower level}} {{is home to}} the {{reference}} collection, adult non-fiction, periodicals, <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> and public computer terminals. The 180 seat theatre and both the Honor Currie and Legion meeting rooms and training room are also found on this level.|$|R
5000|$|The National Library of Ireland Down Survey {{maps are}} issued on <b>microfilm</b> to <b>readers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Peters placed {{electric}} <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> and projectors in {{the vault}} to enable viewing {{and listening to}} these recordings. He provided a generator operated by a windmill to drive the apparatus, {{as well as a}} seven-power magnifier to read the microfilm records by hand in the event that the current form of electricity is not in use in AD 8113. Peters even included some current-day scientific instruments.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} system {{was used to}} access pages from the Walnut system. Users would look up keywords stored on an IBM 1405 hard disk system, identifying individual documents to be retrieved. The machine produced punched cards that were inserted into the Walnut. The Walnut system retrieved the documents, copied them onto a film strip and developed it, and then inserted four such images into an aperture card. The card could be read directly on a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> or used as negatives for full-sized printouts.|$|E
50|$|The general {{process for}} scale age {{analysis}} preparation is as follows. During collection, {{it is important}} to make sure to sample the same area {{on the same side of}} each individual. Insert the scale into a scale envelope, then press on acetate slides or it can be washed in distilled water and rubbed between the fingers. Mount the scale on glass slides and dry in moderate heat, 37˚C or 100˚ F. The annuli may be counted using a microscope, <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> or other such magnification device.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> is {{a device}} used in {{projecting}} and magnifying images stored in microform to readable proportions. Microform includes flat film, microfilm, aperture cards, microfiche, and ultra fiche. Using open reels or cassettes, microfilm {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} store many documents in a small space. It has become increasingly prevalent in the development of films, as well as storage of archived newspapers. With the invention of microfilm, microfilm readers soon developed. With the increasing popularity of computers, microform has decreased in use. However, many library archives still remain in microform.|$|E
5000|$|With each {{microfilm}} product subscription, IAC {{included a}} large rotating carousel with slots {{in which the}} cartridges could be stored for easy access, and also sold proprietary <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> for its cartridges. The readers were able to automatically take up the loose end of the microfilm upon cartridge insertion after a second or two, while standard microfilm reels must be manually wound into a reader, which is much slower.|$|R
5000|$|From fiction, to anime, mystery, history, {{and large}} print, IPL's shelves cover {{a wide range}} of subject matter and formats. Patrons can also find DVD's, video games, computers, eReaders, puzzles, <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> printers, scanners, and a nearly {{complete}} set of yearbooks from Independence High School dating back to 1911. [...] The library {{is also a member of}} SEKnFind, a 41-member consortium of Southeast Kansas Libraries, allowing for a robust inter-library loan program.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, well-funded U.S. public {{libraries}} in the 1980s and 1990s typically had several Infotrac database terminals, several carousels of IAC cartridges, and several <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers.</b> Researchers {{would use the}} database terminals to compile {{a list of all}} the cartridge-and-frame codes for all articles they were interested in, then they would pull the corresponding cartridges from the carousels and use printers built into the readers to make photocopies of the articles as originally printed.|$|R
5000|$|A microfilmer is {{a machine}} {{used by the}} {{document}} management industry to create microfilm. These machines are also often called [...] "imagers" [...] in the industry. A microfilmer is a camera {{that is used to}} photograph documents to create a more compact and permanent record of the original in the form of roll-film or microfiche. Once the information contained on a paper document has been recorded onto microfilm, the information can be viewed later on a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> or viewer, or reproduced in paper form on a microfilm reader-printer.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} method {{followed at}} the ORI was to preserve manuscripts by capturing them in microfilm, which then necessitated {{the use of}} a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> for viewing or studying. Once the ORI has digitized the manuscripts, the text can be viewed and manipulated by a computer. Software is then used to put together disjointed pieces of manuscripts and to correct or fill in any missing text. In this manner, the manuscripts are restored and enhanced. The original palm leaf manuscripts are also on reference at the ORI for those interested.|$|E
50|$|Only the {{microfilm}} {{collections are}} allowed to be viewed by researchers. Services are {{made available to the}} faculty, staff and students of UST as well as to outsiders. UST students are required to present his/her library card and a letter from the adviser or Department Head. Research fee of P20.00 per visit is charged for researchers. <b>Microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> fee is P2.00 per hour, while a fee of P4.00 per page is charged for the microfilm printer. The microfilm section is open to researchers every Tuesdays to Fridays at 9:00 to 12:00 AM, and 1:00 to 5:00 PM.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2011, PRONI reopened in new {{purpose built}} {{premises}} at 2 Titanic Boulevard, BT3 9HQ, in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast, approximately one {{mile from the}} city centre. The £29 million new headquarters includes a larger public search room, a reading room with seats for 78 users (most of which have access to power for laptops), a wifi cafe, <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> self-service digital cameras for digital copying, electronic information points, public art integrated {{into the fabric of}} the building, lecture theatre facilities, and dedicated exhibition space.|$|R
50|$|The Charlotte County Archives is a {{collection}} of thousands of original documents reflecting various individuals, groups, and businesses who have contributed to the social, cultural, economic and political life of Charlotte County, New Brunswick. Its collections date back to the 18th century. Visitors to the Archives have access to more than 5,000 photographic images dating from the 1850s, manuscripts and theses, Charlotte County newspapers, maps and architectural drawings, letters, diaries, and ships' logs. The reference room includes family histories, and other genealogical resources, a small research library and <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, a few {{libraries}} {{began to}} implement microfilm as a means of preserving records. A 1904 fire in the National Library of Turin that destroyed more than half the manuscripts stored there raised concerns of preservation of unique and rare materials. In 1905, these issues were addressed at the Congres International pour la reproduction des Manuscripts, des Monnaies et des Sceaux. It was decided that a photographic library would be established in all libraries. In 1956, Unesco set up a special microfilm unit with the intention of visiting various countries to micro film books, documents, and other cultural material in danger of being destroyed and those which are irreplaceable. This special unit also trained technicians to handle <b>microfilm.</b> <b>Microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> are stored in special rooms known as “Reading rooms”, with two prevalent types of readers. The first is for use of transparent microphotographs and the other used for micro opaque cards. In modern translucent <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers,</b> light is projected into a film producing an enlarged image of the film on a translucent screen, and in opaque readers the same process occurs except the image in on an opaque screen. In using a translucent screen, the image can be seen in daylight, provided no direct sunlight in on the screen. The opaque screen however, is cheaper to produce but requires a darker room.|$|R
50|$|A {{new era of}} {{library service}} began with the move to the new building. A new {{bookmobile}} was purchased in 1978. A high-tech microfilm reader-printer {{was given to the}} library by the B'nai B'rith Lodge in 1970. Several neighborhood libraries were established under the Model Cities Program (no longer in existence). Art work was added to the circulating collection. The Israelite House of David research room was opened. The library offered rental of videodiscs, and later videotapes. A computer terminal with internet access was made available to the public in 1997. That same year, the Benton Harbor Lions Club Foundation paid for half of a new $14,000 <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> printer.|$|E
5000|$|Afterwards, Ken {{notices a}} small {{slip of paper}} with the words [...] "Tim Ak Bak" [...] on it. Ken {{immediately}} assumes that it says [...] "Timberlake Bank". Kathy then reminds Ken of when his parents came over for dinner one time, and that everyone {{was talking about a}} bank robbery three months ago. It soon comes to their attention that the money was stolen. Ken and Kathy then go to a local library, and upon doing some research through a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader,</b> they find out that the guys in the forest made the headlines, and that they allegedly stole $250,000. Ken and Kathy only found part of it.|$|E
5000|$|A distant {{precursor}} of the wiki concept was Vannevar Bush's {{vision of the}} [...] "memex," [...] a <b>microfilm</b> <b>reader</b> which would create automated links between documents. In a 1945 essay in Atlantic Monthly titled [...] "As We May Think," [...] Bush described an imaginary future user interface: [...] "Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions… The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined… Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined {{together to form a}} trail, they can be reviewed in turn…" [...] This vision, though it has been described as predicting the World Wide Web, resembles wikis more than the web in one important way: the system being described is self-contained, not a loose network.|$|E
5000|$|The library can seat up to 1,400 patrons. It is {{equipped}} with eighteen group study rooms, available for checkout from the circulation desk, as well as eight study booths with computers and four booths equipped for viewing videos. Thirty iPad 3 devices are available for checkout at the circulation desk. Four digital [...] <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> are also available for public use, {{in addition to a}} significant number of computers and printers. There are numerous carrels and study facilities located on the top floors for graduate students, and the top two floors of the library are designated for quiet study only.|$|R
50|$|The library has the {{collection}} of microfilms and microfiches. This collection of the library includes a variety of reports, for example, Census of India publications of the earlier period beginning from 1872, {{a large number of}} gazetteers of India down to district level published during the British period. The memoirs and annual reports of Archaeological Survey of India, legislative proceedings/debates for the period 1854 to 1957 for the Central Legislative Body, proceedings of many other legislative bodies in the country, a large number of periodicals, many newspapers (e.g., Tribune from 1881 to 1995), newspapers from a number of South Asian countries etc. The Library has <b>microfilm</b> <b>readers</b> to facilitate the use of these documents.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} Krasker Film and Video services, current periodicals, <b>microfilm</b> and microfiche <b>readers</b> and printers, and a study area.|$|R
