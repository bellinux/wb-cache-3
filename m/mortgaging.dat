5|$|Stokesay Castle {{was built}} in the 1280s and 1290s in the village of Stokesay by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant. Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word stoches, meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the {{beginning}} of the 12th century onwards. In 1241, Hugh de Say sold Stokesay to John de Verdon; John then left for the Eighth Crusade in 1270, <b>mortgaging</b> the land on a life-time lease to Philip de Whichcote. John died in 1274, leaving his rights to the property to his son, Theobald.|$|E
5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or <b>mortgaging</b> their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The act {{authorised}} {{an initial}} £75,000 {{to be raised}} to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should be raised by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by <b>mortgaging</b> the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, {{and there was also}} disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.|$|E

40|$|Using {{detailed}} information on lobbying and <b>mortgage</b> lending activities, we find that lenders lobbying more on issues related to <b>mortgage</b> lending (i) had higher loan-to-income ratios, (ii) securitized more intensively, and (iii) had faster growing portfolios.

The findings are robust to (i) falsification tests using lobbying on issues unrelated to <b>mortgage</b> lending, (ii) a difference-in-difference approach based on state-level laws, and (iii) instrumental variables strategies.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} <b>mortgage</b> covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute <b>mortgage</b> funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of <b>mortgage</b> loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

Finally, lending standards declined more in areas with higher <b>mortgage</b> securitization rates.

25|$|The canal was {{originally}} conceived {{as part of}} a bigger scheme to link Aberdeen to Monymusk, via Inverurie, with a branch from Inverurie along the course of the Ury Glen to Insch. Captain George Taylor conducted a survey, which confirmed that the plan was feasible, in 1793, but by the time a subscription list was started, the plans had been truncated, with just the section from Aberdeen to Inverurie remaining. Advertisements appeared in the local press, listing the benefits of the enterprise, which included increasing the value of certain stone quarries and land. By 1795, some £11,000 had been pledged, and a general meeting was held, at which the subscribers decided that work would commence as soon at subscriptions reached £14,000. Notices were placed in the press, encouraging those wanted to see the canal completed to come forward and pledge their support. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 26 April 1796, which created The Company of Proprietors of the Aberdeenshire Canal Navigation, and authorised them to raise £20,000 in £50 shares. No person was permitted to have less than one share or more than 40. If required, they could raise an additional £10,000 either by issuing more shares, or by <b>mortgaging</b> the tolls which would be collected.|$|E

First, we demonstrate interest rates and income to be the major determinants of delinquency. Then, we adopt a stress testing approach to calculate the impact of any adverse changes in these determinants. This suggests that a 1. 3 percentage point increase in <b>mortgage</b> interest rate leads to a 20 percent decrease in a typical bank''s distance to default. Finally, {{we look at the}} cross-sectional differences and indentify the banks with rapid loan growth along with high cost-income ratio as the most vulnerable.

The average coefficients that measure the agents'' ability to self-insure against income shocks {{are similar to those}} of a SIM model without housing but housing increases the values of these coefficients for younger agents. The response of consumption to house price shocks is minimal. The introduction of minimum down payments or income garnishment benefits a majority of the population.

[...] They found that Aurora was in no {{condition}} for an Antarctic voyage, and required an extensive overhaul. The registration of the ship in Shackleton's name had not been properly completed, and Shackleton had evidently misunderstood the terms under which he had acquired the vessel from [...] Mawson. [...] Mawson had reclaimed much of the equipment and stores that had been aboard, all of which needed replacing. To compound the problem, Shackleton had reduced the funds available to Mackintosh from £2,000 to £1,000, expecting him to bridge the difference by soliciting for supplies as free gifts and by <b>mortgaging</b> the ship. There was no cash available to cover the wages and living expenses for the party.|$|E

Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition, led by himself (as the Dutch strongly wished) to succour the rebels. In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered, political chaos ensued, and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the Duke of Parma. An English intervention became inevitable; {{it was decided that}} Leicester would go to the Netherlands and [...] "be their chief as heretofore was treated of", as he phrased it in August 1585. He was alluding to the recently signed Treaty of Nonsuch in which his position and authority as [...] "governor-general" [...] of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined. The Earl prepared himself for [...] "God's cause and her Majesty's" [...] by recruiting the expedition's cavalry from his retainers and friends, and by <b>mortgaging</b> his estate to the sum of £25,000.|$|E
40|$|The rapid <b>mortgage</b> {{credit growth}} {{experienced}} {{in recent years}} in mature and emerging countries has raised some stability concerns. Many European credit institutions in mature markets have reacted by increasing securitization, particularly via <b>mortgage</b> covered bonds. From the issuer''s perspective, these instruments have become an attractive funding source and a tool for assetliability management; from the investor''s perspective, covered bonds enjoy a favorable risk-return profile and a very liquid market. In this paper, we examine the two largest "jumbo" covered bond markets, Germany and Spain. We show how movements in covered bond prices can be used to analyze the credit developments of the underlying issuer and the quality of its <b>mortgage</b> portfolio. Our analysis also suggests that <b>mortgage</b> covered bonds could be of interest to other mature and emerging markets facing similar risks related to <b>mortgage</b> credit.

It does so by comparing the U.

Regression analysis indicates the expected negative relationship between U. S. saving and net worth, with a somewhat smaller coefficient than in previous studies.
