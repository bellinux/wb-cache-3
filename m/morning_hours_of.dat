5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development. Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity. By the late <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Oklahoma City {{and surrounding}} communities, strong straightline winds caused damage to several buildings and downed trees and power {{lines in the}} early <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> May 7, with cleanup efforts being complicated due to flooding rains accompanying the storm. About 11,000 homes were without power during the event. There were also reports of floods across many other areas in Oklahoma.

5|$|In {{the early}} <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> December 13, 1977, a {{dormitory}} fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, {{the demographics of}} the student body continued to change, as women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.|$|E

A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or {{claimed responsibility for the}} bombing.|$|E
50|$|After a {{night of}} high seas, wind and storm, the typhoon of June 1945 reached its peak in the dark early <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> 5AM, at which time a freak wave hit the {{destroyer}} escort USS CONKLIN DE 439 and rolled her onto her side. The ship rolled more the 72 degrees, and lost all power. By rights the ship should have continued to roll and sink. A freak wave reportedly knocked the ship upright again.|$|R

It ran an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> Saturday <b>morning</b> cartoons during the 7 a.m. hour on a one-week delay to run the hour-long locally produced children's program, The Gene London Show, which ended in 1977.

By 1980, the station was running the entire Saturday morning cartoon lineup again and by early in 1981, the Sunday <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> children's programs was brought back.|$|R

It {{is part of the}} Christian liturgies of Eastern Christianity, but in the Latin Rite it was suppressed [...] by the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council. However, clergy who have an obligation to celebrate the Liturgy <b>of</b> the <b>Hours</b> may still fulfil their obligation by using the Roman Breviary promulgated by Pope John XXIII in 1962, which contains the <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Prime. Like all the liturgical hours, except the Office of Readings, it consists primarily of Psalms. [...] It is one <b>of</b> the Little <b>Hours.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it {{impossible for them to}} get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|This first {{hurricane}} of the season's {{effects were}} first noted in Santa Clara, Cuba, where rainy and windy conditions were observed {{on the afternoon}} of June 14. Several vessels sank during the hurricane during the early <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> June 15. The system was thought to have entered the Florida Straits during the evening. The system began to travel towards the west-northwest, steadily strengthening into a hurricane by the afternoon. On June 17, a minimum pressure of 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg) was recorded, as the hurricane passed over southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk in the early <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 27 January.|$|E
25|$|Additional damage {{occurred}} about 50 miles (80km) southeast in Anaheim as {{the scoreboard}} at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. The stadium was vacant at the time. Although several commercial buildings also collapsed, {{loss of life}} was minimized because <b>of</b> the early <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the quake, and because it also occurred on a federal holiday (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day). Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes dictate that buildings incorporate structural design intended to withstand earthquakes. However, the damage caused revealed that some structural specifications did not perform as intended. Because of these revelations, building codes were revised. Some structures were not red-tagged until months later, because damage was not immediately evident.|$|R
