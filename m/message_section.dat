40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} economic analysis of patient-provider communication through secure <b>messaging.</b> <b>Section</b> 1 presents {{the evolution of}} secure <b>messaging.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 aims to determine whether secure messages can substitute for face-to-face office visits. To answer this question, two demand equations were estimated and outpatient copayment {{was used as a}} key factor. A quasi-conditional maximum likelihood estimator was used as it is robust when there are distributional misspecifications and accounts for individual unobserved heterogeneity. Controlling for individual characteristics such as age, gender, insurance source, health status, and individual unobserved heterogeneity (fixed effects), we found that an increase by $ 1 in the price of office visits, measured by outpatient copayment, leads to 0. 45 % fewer office visits and 4. 4 % more secure messages. This is a strong indication that secure messages and office visits are substitutes. Section 3 aims to determine whether secure messaging reduces provider costs. To answer this question, a cost minimizing model is estimated. An instrumental variable approach was used to correct for the potential correlation of health and secure messaging user measures with the error term. A potential problem of unobserved individual heterogeneity was also taken into account. While we did not find evidence that secure messaging users impact the primary, specialty, inpatient, and emergency care costs, we did find evidence that individual costs on drugs are reduced by 66. 4 % per quarter. A lack of evidence on the impact of secure messaging on most costs may be due to limitations in the way costs are measured. Finally, to overcome a limitation of the quasi estimator used in Section 2, Section 4 seeks to introduce a new estimator ZI QCMLE aimed at estimating count and continuous models with an excess number of zeros and unobserved individual heterogeneity. This approach is similar to a zero inflated model in the way it deals with excess zeros, but unlike a zero inflated model it is robust to distributional misspecifications. Also, its ability to deal with fixed effects makes this estimator unique...|$|R

The exact message complexity can be expressed as a order function of clients in computation.

50|$|The VMSC will {{request the}} {{information}} needed {{for it to}} deliver the Short Message to its recipient by sending a Send_Info_for_MT_SMS message to the VLR. The VLR will then instigate a page request, or subscriber search, for the destination subscribers Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN), and return the result to the VMSC. Since a typical deployment sees the VLR being co-located with the MSC, this message flow is usually internal to the platform. Should the page or search for the subscriber fail, the VLR will indicate the failure cause to the VMSC, which will abort the Short Message delivery procedure and return the failure to the SMSC (see the Failed Short <b>Message</b> delivery <b>section</b> below). If the page of the handset was successful, the VMSC will then send to the SMSC indicating successful delivery. The GMSC component of the SMSC passes {{the result of the}} delivery attempt to the Service Centre. In the case of successful delivery, the delivered text message will be removed from the Store and Forward Engine (SFE) and, if requested, a delivery report sent to the text originator.

40|$|During {{the message}} transmission, an {{impairment}} occurs {{from time to}} time i. e. an error arises which is caused by interfering signals during the transmission. The situation requires that the respective coding is adapted as much as possible to the given conditions of the transmission. The convolutional coding is suitable for the correction of burst errors. However, the procedure of the majority of burst error correction solutions is very demanding. This article therefore explains a complex procedure of design and simulation in Matlab on a specific case which is suitable for its simplicity and makes the explanation of the lesson easier. Key words: Forward error correction, convolution coding, burst error. The algorithm principle is based on the detection of the shortest Hamming distance of the decoded sequence from the received sequence. The substantial disadvantage of the above-mentioned method consists in {{the fact that it is}} significantly demanding as for the number of numerical operations. This method is used only for the decoding of codes with relatively short constraint lengths because the dependency of the number of operations on the constraint length has an exponential character. Another method which can be used for error detection is the threshold decoding principle. The threshold decoding is based on finding a sufficient number of check operations among the elements of <b>message</b> <b>sections</b> which are in the so-called orthogonality relation towards the element whose correctness is checked after the transmission.
