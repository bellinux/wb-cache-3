Our preliminary results demonstrate that the ratio of the 158 (<b>micron)</b> <b>meter</b> [C II] emission to the CO- 12 (1 yields 0) emission ranges from 6, 000 to 46, 000. These ratios are significantly enhanced relative to clouds within the Galaxy and to normal metallicity galaxies, which typically have values in the range 2, 000 to 6, 300. We also find that the [C II] emission in dwarf irregular galaxies can be up to 5 % of the far-infrared (FIR) emission, a higher fraction of the FIR than in normal metallicity galaxies. We discuss these results for the dwarf irregular galaxies and compare them to those observed in normal metallicity galaxies. The enhanced 158 (<b>micron)</b> <b>meter</b> [C II] emission relative to CO- 12 (1 yields 0) emission can be understood in terms of the increased penetration depth of ultraviolet (UV) photons into the clouds in low metallicity environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiative}} relaxation {{mechanism of}} water between its different phases is studied to understand an uncommon radiation phenomenon {{observed in the}} first-order phase-transition process of water. This kind of radiation {{is often referred to}} as phase-transition radiation, whose nature is different from the Planckian radiation because its strength can be even stronger than blackbody radiation at the same temperature. In the theoretical approach of this study, analytical thermodynamic models for condensed-state water are presented to study its energetic behaviors at temperatures ranging from a few degrees K to near the critical point. Changes of energetic behaviors of water molecules during phase-transitions are of special interest and are linked to the direct emission of infrared radiation. A two-level energy transition model is proposed to investigate the characteristic radiation during vapor condensation, leading to a newly defined absorption coefficient for phase-transition radiation in the radiative transfer equation. The reported characteristic radiation for vapor condensation at wavelength 4 - 8 <b>micron</b> <b>meter</b> is attributed to the radiative relaxation with one hydrogen-bond formation in liquid-water during vapor condensation. In addition to the theoretical modeling, optical measurements are also included in this study to examine the energy transmission characteristics in vapor-liquid mixtures of water in the 3 - 5 <b>micron</b> <b>meter</b> spectral range.

On the other hand, SWNTs grown by metal particles supported on zeolite were probed to have narrow chirality distribution by near infrared fluorescence spectroscopy [4]. The near armchair nanotubes such as (6, 5) and (7, 5) are predominantly generated probably because of the stability of nanotube cap structure.

The quality of the assembled micro device {{would depend on the}} accuracy of the alignment process. Optical Alignment System (OSA) for semiconductor industry has very high level of precision. But the system is too expensive, {{and the size of the}} marker is too big for practical application in the area of micro assembly. On the other hand, the alignment resolution of typical vision type of optical alignment system, limited by the wavelength of the light, is difficult to push too much beyond the um range. Therefore it is the objective of this presentation to discuss the finding of our investigation for an alternative low cost method that can operate in the tens of Nano Meter (nm) Range, and have the potential extending further into nm range. Mechanical alignment system (MAS) is widely used in industry because of its simplicity, low cost and easy to use. However, there is a fairly common notion in the industry that MAS is relatively crude, and is not suitable for precision manufacturing. To certain extend, there are some reasons leading to that kind of erroneous conclusion.

The calculations take into account the feedback from sputtering and IR emission on the gas-phase abundances, the cooling, and the ionization and thermal structure of the shock. Sputtering changes the initial grain size distribution, creating a deficiency of small (radius < 50 A) grains compared to their preshock abundances. The altered grain size distribution depends on shock velocity and the density of the interstellar medium. Dust particles with sizes below approximately equal 300 A are stochastically heated, undergo temperature fluctuations, and radiate an excess of near-infrared emission (i </= 40 (<b>micron)</b> <b>meter)</b> over that expected for grains in thermal equilibrium. This near-infrared excess {{is a measure of the}} abundance of small grains and therefore a powerful diagnostic for the amount of destruction the grains were subjected to in the shock. We present here IR spectra from collisionally heated dust for a variety of shocks, and depict the changes in the spectra as a function of postshock column density. Our studies compliment those of Vancura et at. that examined the effects of the release of the sputtered refractory elements on the ultraviolet and X-ray emission. Multiwavelength observations at X-ray, Ultraviolet (UV), and IR wavelengths are therefore essential in piecing together a comprehensive picture of the physics of grain destruction in fast astrophysical shocks...|$|R

So far, each SPARTAN location has been active between the years 2013 and 2016 over periods of 2 - 26 months, with an average period of 12 months per site. These sites have collectively gathered over 10 years of quality aerosol data. The major PM (sub 2. 5) constituents across all sites (relative contribution plus or minus Standard Deviation) are ammoniated sulfate (20 percent plus or minus 11 percent), crustal material (13. 4 percent plus or minus 9. 9 percent), equivalent black carbon (11. 9 percent plus or minus 8. 4 percent), ammonium nitrate (4. 7 percent plus or minus 3. 0 percent), sea salt (2. 3 percent plus or minus 1. 6 percent), trace element oxides (1. 0 percent plus or minus 1. 1 percent), water (7. 2 percent plus or minus 3. 3 percent) at 35 percent relative humidity, and residual matter (40 percent plus or minus 24 percent). Analysis of filter samples reveals that several PM (sub 2. 5) chemical components varied by more than an order of magnitude between sites. Ammoniated sulfate ranges from 1. 1 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Buenos Aires, Argentina) to 17 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Kanpur, India in the dry season). Ammonium nitrate ranged from 0. 2 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Mammoth Cave, in summer) to 6. 8 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Kanpur, dry season). Equivalent black carbon ranged from 0. 7 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Mammoth Cave) to over 8 <b>microns</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> (Dhaka, Bangladesh and Kanpur, India). Comparison of SPARTAN vs. coincident measurements from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network at Mammoth Cave yielded a high degree of consistency for daily PM (sub 2. 5) (r squared equals 0. 76, slope equals 1. 12), daily sulfate (r squared equals 0. 86, slope equals 1. 03), and mean fractions of all major PM (sub 2. 5) components (within 6 percent). Major ions generally agree well with previous studies at the same urban locations (e. g. sulfate fractions agree within 4 percent for 8 out of 11 collocation comparisons). Enhanced anthropogenic dust fractions in large urban areas (e. g. Singapore, Kanpur, Hanoi, and Dhaka) are apparent from high Zn to Al ratios. The expected water contribution to aerosols is calculated via the hygroscopicity parameter kappa (sub v (volume)) for each filter. Mean aggregate values ranged from 0. 15 (Ilorin) to 0. 28 (Rehovot). The all-site parameter mean is 0. 20 plus or minus 0. 04. Chemical composition and water retention in each filter measurement allows inference of hourly PM (sub 2. 5) at 35 percent relative humidity by merging with nephelometer measurements. These hourly PM (sub 2. 5) estimates compare favourably with a beta attenuation monitor (MetOne) at the nearby US embassy in Beijing, with a coefficient of variation r squared equals 0. 67 (number equals 3167), compared to r squared equals 0. 62 when v (volume) was not considered. SPARTAN continues to provide an open-access database of PM (sub 2. 5) compositional filter information and hourly mass collected from a global federation of instruments...|$|R
40|$|There {{are some}} {{significant}} differences between the way seismologists and geologists typically look at faulting from large earthquakes. Seismologists tend to analyze waveform data which can usually resolve structures on the order of tens of kilometers; possibly down to one kilometers there is very good near-field data. Also, the derived physically properties are averaged over this scale length. Although it is difficult to resolve small scale features, seismologic studies have the advantage of seeing all depths of the fault. In contrast fault zone geologists can make direct observations of the fault zone structures and properties, which are quite different from the remote sensing techniques of seismolo-gists. Geologists tend to look at structures on the scale of <b>microns</b> to <b>meters</b> when examining the cores obtained from drilling into faults. These observations are spot measure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGas {{turbine engines}} are very complex (with 20 – 40, 000 parts) and have extreme {{operating}} conditions. The important physical phenomena {{take place on}} scales from 10 – 100 <b>microns</b> to <b>meters.</b> A complete and accurate dynamic simulation of an entire engine is enormously demanding. Designing a complex system, like a gas turbine engine, will require fast, accurate simulations of computational models from multiple engineering disciplines along with sophisticated optimization techniques to help guide the design process. In this paper, we describe the architecture of an agent-based software framework for the simulation of various aspects of a gas turbine engine, utilizing a “network” of collaborating numerical objects {{through a set of}} interfaces among the engine parts. Moreover, we present its implementation using the Grasshopper agent middleware and provide simulation results that show the feasibility of the computational paradigm implemented...|$|R
40|$|A {{non-contact}} sensor {{based on}} the interaction of a person with electric fields for human-computer interface is investigated. Two sensing modes are explored: an external electric field shunted to ground through a human body, and an external electric field transmitted through a human body to stationary receivers. The sensors are low power (milliwatts), high resolution (millimeter) low cost (a few dollars per channel), have low latency (millisecond), high update rate (1 kHz), high immunity to noise (> 72 dB), are not affected by clothing, surface texture or reflectivity, and can operate on length scales from <b>microns</b> to <b>meters.</b> Systems incorporating the sensors include a finger mouse, a room that knows the location of its occupant, and people-sensing furniture. Haptic feedback using passive materials is described. Also discussed are empirical and analytical approaches to transform sensor measurements into position information.
