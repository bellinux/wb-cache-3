The <b>MYC</b> <b>oncogene</b> is critically important {{in a variety of}} hematological malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism by which expression of the v-myc oncogene interferes with the competence of primary quail myoblasts to undergo terminal differentia- tion. Previous studies have established that quail myoblasts transformed by <b>myc</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are severely impaired in the accumulation of mRNAs encoding the myogenic transcription factors Myf- 5, MyoD and Myogenin. However, the mechanism responsible for such a repression remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that v-Myc selectively interferes with quail myoD expression at the transcriptional level. Cis- regulatory elements involved in the auto-activation of qmyoD are speci®cally targeted in this unique example of transrepression by v-Myc, without the apparent participation of Myc-speci®c E-boxes or InR sequences. Transiently expressed v-Myc e ciently interfered with MyoD-dependent transactivation of the qmyoD regula- tory elements, while the myogenin promoter was unaffected. Finally, we show that forced expression of MyoD in v-myc-transformed quail myoblasts restored myogenin expression and promoted extensive terminal differentiation. These data suggest that transcriptional repression of qmyoD is a major and rate-limiting step in the molecular pathway by which v-Myc severely inhibits terminal differentiation in myogenic cells...|$|R
40|$|The <b>myc</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are {{frequently}} activated in human tumors, {{but there is}} no comprehensive insight into the target genes and downstream cellular pathways of these transcription factors. We applied serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to identify targets of N-myc in neuroblastomas. Analysis of 42 000 mRNA transcript tags in SAGE libraries of N-myc- transfected and control neuroblastoma cells revealed 114  up-regulated genes. The majority of these genes have a role in ribosome assembly and activity. Northern blot analysis confirmed up-regulation of all tested transcripts.

Cellular rRNA content was 45 % induced. SAGE libraries and northern blot analysis confirmed up-regulation of many of these genes in N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas. As N-myc can functionally replace c-myc, we analyzed whether N-myc targets were induced by c-myc as well.

Southern blots show that the tumor exhibits immunoglobulin joining segment rearrangement but no rearrangement of the <b>MYC</b> <b>oncogene.</b> Cloning of the rearranged joining segment allowed the isolation of recombinant clones encompassing the translocation breakpoint, and sequencing of the translocation junction disclosed that the breakpoint is situated 7 base pairs from the chromosome 14 site involved in a previously described endemic Burkitt lymphoma translocation. Furthermore, the breakpoint is situated far from MYC on chromosome 8, a constant finding in endemic Burkitt lymphomas. That the molecular architecture of the translocation in this case is strikingly similar to previously analyzed translocations from endemic Burkitt lymphomas strongly suggests that common molecular mechanisms must be operative in the pathogenesis of these tumors...|$|E

40|$|The GTPase RhoA {{participates in}} a number of {{cellular}} processes, including cytoskeletal organization, mitogenesis and tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that the transforming activity of an oncogenic version of RhoA (Q 63 L mutant) was highly dependent on the transcriptional factor c–Myc. In contrast to these positive effects in the RhoA route, we show here that c–Myc affects negatively the F–actin cytoskeleton induced by RhoAQ 63 L and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase Rock. This effect entails the activation of a transcriptional program that requires synergistic interactions with RhoA–derived signals and that includes the upregulation of the GTPase Cdc 42 and its downstream element Pak 1 as well as the repression of specific integrin subunits. The negative effects of c–Myc in the F–actin cytoskeleton are eliminated by the establishment of cell–to–cell contacts, an effect associated with the rescue of Pak 1 and integrin levels at the post–transcriptional and transcriptional levels, respectively.
