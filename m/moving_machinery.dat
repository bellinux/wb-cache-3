25|$|At 14:00 on July 14, Obrenović was at Snagovo when Major Zoran Jovanović {{brought in}} a {{reinforcement}} company, along with the information that Colonel Ljubiša Beara, officer {{in charge of the}} VRS security service, had transported an abnormally large number of prisoners in buses to Zvornik. That same day Obrenović overheard a call for two engineers to be released from battle lines to build a road; suspicious of someone doing the engineers a favor, Obrenović checked on the message and was told that the engineers were needed in Zvornik because of a task being carried out by Beara, Popović, and Nikolić. Obrenović knew that this must involve mass burials; he released the two engineers and ordered his aides to refrain from discussing the issue. Throughout the next days, Obrenović {{spent most of his time}} trying to find a solution for the column problem, but he also released further military police and infantry personnel from battle lines to assist with the execution of prisoners, and supplied earth <b>moving</b> <b>machinery</b> from his engineering battalions to dig mass graves.|$|E

40|$|A {{major part}} of mineral {{production}} comes from surface mining {{and there has been}} a rapid growth in this sector with the deployment of high capacity equipment. Increased production can be achieved from large capacity surface mines using heavy earth <b>moving</b> <b>machineries.</b> These machineries involve high capital cost, and thus, the mining engineers should plan to achieve the best performance from these machineries. Performance of them, especially the excavating and transporting equipments are largely depending on the blast results, particularly, fragment size, distribution and muck profile. Thus, proper blast design with a computational approach is a vital factor that affects the cost of the entire mining activities...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} the control of {{autonomously}} and slowly <b>moving</b> agricultural <b>machinery</b> is presented. Special emphasis is on offline reference trajectory generation tailored for high-precision closed-loop tracking within agricultural fields using linear time-varying model predictive control. When optimisation is carried out, high-level logistical processing can result in edgy reference paths for field coverage. Subsequent trajectory smoothing can consider specific actuator rate constraints and field geometry. The latter step {{is the subject of}} this paper. Focussing on forward motion only, the role of non-convexly shaped field geometry, repressed area minimisation and spraying gap avoidance is analysed. Three design methods for generating smooth reference trajectories are discussed: circle-segments, generalised elementary paths, and bi-elementary paths...|$|R

30|$|One related {{issue is}} {{raised by the}} {{existence}} of different entry/exit barriers that may occur at the different stages of the production process. When this is the case, the outcome can, again, be fragmentation with different sizes for the different steps. A sound example of all these aspects of idiosyncrasy is provided by agriculture that uses land as a basic input. The use of land has relevant implications {{in terms of the}} management of the production process as time is required for <b>moving</b> worker <b>machineries</b> and other inputs across the farm. This means that the efficient scale for primary production is typically smaller compared to that for the subsequent operations. Moreover, land is subject to relevant entry barriers, especially in densely populated countries, thus, further reducing the operational scale of farming. Last, idiosyncrasies are also related to land as {{it is part of the}} natural environment. Natural resources present variable features in different places and determine a strong rooting of the primary process in specific locations, while the subsequent steps are generally less rooted on one specific location and are definitely more mobile.|$|R
