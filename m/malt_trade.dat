500|$|Trade thrived, for Richard Blome {{recorded}} the prosperous Stamford <b>malt</b> <b>trade</b> in 1673, which depended on barley being carried by boat. With {{the death of}} Daniel Wigmore, his son-in-law Charles Halford became {{the owner of the}} toll rights. In 1695, he was receiving between £400 and £500 per year, most of it derived from the carriage of sea coal. The trade amounted to 3,000 chaldrons that year, and he tried to get the tax on sea coal, which Parliament had approved, reversed. He did not succeed, and failed again in 1706, by which time he stated that the tax had decreased the amount of coal carried to just 500 chaldrons. Besides coal, the canal carried malt and agricultural produce, groceries, timber, slate and stone. Boats used on the canal were small lighters, [...] long by around [...] wide, capable of carrying from seven to fourteen tons, and normally worked in trains of four vessels.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the growth}} of the <b>malt</b> <b>trade</b> in Bishop's Stortford in the early eighteenth century, {{attention}} turned to providing better transport facilities. The River Stort joined the River Lee, and the <b>malt</b> <b>trade</b> at Ware had benefitted from improvements made on that river. A similar solution was therefore sought for the Stort, and a public meeting was held on 11 December 1758. The chief promoter seems to have been Thomas Adderley. A bill was duly submitted to parliament, and became an Act of Parliament in March 1759. It was entitled An Act for making the River Stort navigable, in the counties of Hertford and Essex, from the New Bridge, in the town of Bishop Stortford, into the River Lea, near a Place called the Rye, in the county of Hertford. Commissioners were appointed to oversee the work and to raise the capital to fund the project. They failed in this duty, and the powers of the first act lapsed, as it imposed time limits during which the work had to be completed.|$|E
50|$|His {{failure to}} make a {{financial}} profit from writing was probably {{the primary reason for}} his change of career, and he returned to Bury St. Edmunds to run The Seven Stars for his mother-in-law. Here he unwisely stood surety for the sum of £200 for his brother, Edward, only to lose the money when Edward fled to Australia. He then embarked on a malting speculation, buying large quantities of the product, possibly for re-sale or to start a business, but he was largely ignorant of the <b>malt</b> <b>trade,</b> and his scheme collapsed, leaving him financially ruined.|$|E
50|$|By 1864, Reed {{targeted}} the brewing industry with Brewers Journal, and its supplement, Hop & <b>Malt</b> <b>Trades</b> Review and in 1868 he had added Tobacco Trade Review to his company's magazine line up. Reed died in 1920; {{at that time}} The Grocer was his company's best known publication, and {{was used by the}} Ministry of Food to make announcements.|$|R
50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, coal was mined around Clee Hill {{and lead}} was mined {{near the border}} with Wales, e.g. at Snailbeach. Church Stretton was a centre of textile {{manufacture}} and Ludlow thrived on the <b>malting</b> <b>trade,</b> {{while the rest of}} the area was populated by smallholders. The economy of the area was fragile, and most industry in the area had collapsed by 1900.|$|R
50|$|Warminster's {{clothing}} trade suffered {{greatly in}} the early 19th century, as there was no suitable river to power machinery {{during a period of}} industrialisation. At the same time its <b>malting</b> <b>trade</b> declined but remained important. In 1855, William Morgan commissioned the Warminster Maltings, now the oldest working maltings in Britain. By 1860, the town had adopted new trades in brewing and iron-founding, so it did not suffer greatly from the loss of the other trades. One example was the Woodcock Ironworks, which was set up by John Wallis Titt in the town in the mid-1870s to manufacture agricultural machines.|$|R

A spatial equilibrium model {{of production and}} trade is {{used to assess the}} effects of alternative levels of supply, demand, and policy variables on composition and direction of malting barley and <b>malt</b> <b>trade</b> flows. malting barley, malt, beer, trade, spatial equilibrium, Marketing, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|European Union (EU) {{dominance}} of the world <b>malt</b> <b>trade</b> {{is thought to be}} due to quality advantages and/or due to export restitutions. A Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS) was estimated for four major malt importing countries: Japan, Brazil, Philippines, and Venezuela. Elasticities of substitution for malt among different sources were computed. Results show that malt imported from the EU is least substitutable with malt from other sources, and demand for EU malt is less responsive to changes in price. Expenditure elasticities indicate that the four importers spend proportionately more on malt imports from the EU compared to malt from other sources. For these reasons, the study concludes that price subsidy-based export expansion measures for non-EU malt may have limited effects.

50|$|The {{market at}} Warminster {{was the focus}} of the town's prosperity, with {{significant}} wool, clothing and <b>malting</b> <b>trades</b> established by the 16th century and continuing to be the economic backbone of the town until the 19th century. The market also included a significant corn trade throughout the period and was regarded as the second largest corn market in the west of England in 1830. Unlike many markets of the time where farmers would take sample to market, Warminster's corn market required a sack from each load of corn to be available to customers, that each purchase must be agreed between 11am and 1pm and paid for {{by the end of the}} day.|$|R

Later, William III rested here on his march to London in 1688, at the nearby recently rebuilt Fawley Court, and received a deputation from the Lords. The town's period of prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries was due to manufactures of glass and <b>malt,</b> and <b>trade</b> in corn and wool. Henley-on-Thames supplied London with timber and grain.|$|R

S is the biggest importer of Canadian six-row malting barley. This study aims to analyze the welfare effects of State Trading Enterprises (STEs) {{as it applies to}} the US-Canada <b>malting</b> barley <b>trade.</b> A policy simulation was developed to determine the redistributive efficiency of single STE, a competitive structure, and a structure with oligopolistic processors.
