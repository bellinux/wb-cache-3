25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts {{is that most of}} the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate <b>multisite</b> studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} off-label in the U.S., {{which means they}} have not been approved for treating ASD. Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and aripiprazole were underway in early 2008. Aripiprazole may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 <b>multisite</b> randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the psychostimulant methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical children with ADHD. Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone secretin reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit. Oxytocin {{may play a role in}} autism and may be an effective treatment for repetitive and affiliative behaviors; two related studies in adults found that oxytocin decreased repetitive behaviors and improved interpretation of emotions, but these preliminary results do not necessarily apply to children. An experimental drug STX107 has stopped overproduction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in rodents, and it has been hypothesized that this may help in about 5% of autism cases, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans.|$|E
500|$|In March 2012, {{multiple}} {{followers of}} the account began to plan a Molydeux game jam, an event in which game developers would create a game based on one of Molydeux's tweets {{over the course of}} a weekend. Capone supported the effort but limited his participation to the creation of a promotional video. The event, known then as What Would Molydeux? and later as Molyjam, soon grew from a San Francisco-based affair into an international, <b>multisite</b> event with satellite locations in the Netherlands, New York City, and Melbourne in 32 total locations. The event was held the weekend of March 30, and around 1,000 attendees made around 300 games, of which Capone found 15 games interesting. Professional cameos included David Hellman (Braid) in San Francisco and Peter Molyneux himself in London, where he gave an uncharacteristically fiery keynote speech that encouraged developers to [...] "innovate ... come together and do crazy things". While most games tended to consist of normal game mechanics underneath a bizarre concept, Wired said that their inability to deliver on their promise was the jam's [...] "most Molyneuxian touch".|$|E
