40|$|Recent {{publicity}} shows a {{shift in}} the attitude of <b>main</b> contractors to <b>subcontract</b> procurement in the UK. However, a survey of the specialist contractors' sector shows that this impression should be approached with caution: the typical contractor - subcontractor relationship is still traditional, cost-driven, and potentially adversarial. Nevertheless, the co-existence of the two approaches is consistent with the institutional theory of organizational strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|Arising {{from the}} recent shift in the {{attitude}} of <b>main</b> contractors to <b>subcontract</b> procurement {{in some of the}} developing countries of the world, this study presents the findings of the importance of factors influencing the choice of subcontractors by the clients and contractors. With a focus on three commercial nerve centres of Nigeria (Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt), the study presents the findings of a survey of construction clients/contractors and rank the factors they consider in the selection of suitable subcontractors for project execution. The results of the relative index ranking technique indicate that five most important factors are: subcontractors’ past experience in terms of size and type of projects completed; subcontractors’ management resource in terms of formal and informal training; other related issues in terms of nature of contract and time of the year (weather), past relationships with the clients/contractors (past performance), and project facilitation in terms on labour/plant resources. It is concluded that greatest premiums should be attached to some of these factors for improved construction sustainability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Time {{and cost}} {{are among the}} {{important}} aspects considered for every construction project. Many research approaches have been followed to model time-cost relationship. There is a constant rise {{in the use of}} innovative contract methods which provide incentives for maximizing quality. There is an increasing pressure to improve the project performance due to the innovative contracting methods which necessitate developing models incorporating quality along with time and cost. A <b>main</b> contractor normally <b>subcontracts</b> most of the tasks of a project for improving project performance. It is always a complex and challenging task for a main contractor, to choose a correct bid which satisfies the time, cost and quality requirements of a project. In the present study, a differential evolution algorithm is used to solve this multi-objective time-cost-quality optimization problem. Two case studies are analyzed and the results obtained compared with the existing approaches to test the applicability and efficiency of the algorithm. It is evident from the results that the differential evolution algorithm performs efficiently in locating the optimal solution with minimum function evaluation...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. The {{construction}} industry {{has changed dramatically}} over the past thirty odd years. The following factors {{played a significant role}} in this change: (1) The building boom around the 1970 s pressurized the industry to work faster. This was followed by periods of variation in workload, which have over the last number of years manifested in a permanent low demand for construction in South Africa. (2) Projects became larger and more complex. (3) An over-regulated labour environment not only leads to the downsize of organizations, but is a main contributor towards the increased use of subcontracting. (4) The time value of money causes owners to specify compressed project schedules and lowest price is often the only selection factor in the award of contracts. The shift in work from predominantly public sector towards the private sector, which by nature is more time conscious, is another factor pressurizing the industry to work faster. The industry has introduced amongst others the following measures to cope with these demands: (1) <b>Main</b> contractors are <b>subcontracting</b> more and more of the work. (2) The traditional in-series concept came under pressure - the management approaches became formal procurement concepts and design-build re-appeared. (3) New construction techniques such as fast-tracking and the movement towards factory produced elements in certain areas, for example precast concrete elements, reduced project schedules and replaced previously time consuming activities and counteracted to a certain extent the shortage of skilled tradesmen. The author argues that in the process to combat these external pressures, the following problems, amongst others, manifested: (1) Ineffective project procurement. (2) Unethical and unsound practices between main contractors and subcontractors. (3) Lack of quality and reliability of a substantial share of end-products. Another problem burdening the industry is historical, namely cultural differences between designers and contractors...|$|R
