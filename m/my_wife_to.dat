500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>to</b> be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

Sermon ended, as [...] {{was giving}} us the holy sacrament, the chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away... These wretched miscreants held their muskets against us as we came up to receive the sacred elements, as {{if they would have}} shot us at the altar.|$|E
2500|$|Van Persie {{was born}} in Rotterdam to an artistic family. José Ras, his mother, is a painter and {{jewellery}} designer who also teaches special needs children. Bob, his father, is a sculptor. After Van Persie's parents divorced he was brought up by his father. At school, Van Persie {{was one of the}} most misbehaved children and was excluded from class almost daily. [...] After joining Arsenal in England, Van Persie settled in Hampstead, an affluent suburb of north London. Van Persie is married to Moroccan Bouchra Elbali and the couple have two children, a son named Shaqueel and daughter Dina. When asked if this caused him to convert to Islam, Van Persie said, [...] "It's not true. I am not a Muslim, nor a Christian or a Jew. I have been raised liberally. If you want to become a Muslim it should come from the heart. I would not do it just to please <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> <b>To</b> believe for me is a quest for being a good man." ...|$|E
