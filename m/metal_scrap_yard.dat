50|$|A {{scrapyard}} is {{a recycling}} center that buys and sells <b>scrap</b> <b>metal.</b> Scrapyards are effectively a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> brokerage. <b>Scrap</b> <b>yards</b> typically buy any base metal; for example, iron, steel, stainless steel, brass, copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, and lead {{would all be}} found at a modern-day scrapyard. Scrapyards will often buy electronics, appliances, and metal vehicles. Scrapyards will sell their accumulations of metals either to refineries or larger <b>scrap</b> brokers. <b>Metal</b> theft is committed so thieves can sell stolen copper or other stolen valuable metals to scrapyards.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Y- 12 Old Salvage <b>Yard</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> Characterization Study is to make {{conservative}} estimates of the quantities of total uranium and the wt % {sup 235 }U contained in <b>scrap</b> <b>metal.</b> The original project scope included estimates of thorium, but due to the insignificant quantities found in the yards, thorium was excluded from further analysis. Metal {{in three of the}} four Y- 12 <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yards</b> were characterized. The <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yard</b> east of the PIDAS fence is managed by the Environmental Restoration Program and therefore was not included in this study. For all Y- 12 Plant <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> shipments, Waste Transportation, Storage, and Disposal (WTSD) personnel must complete a Request for Authorization to Ship Nuclear Materials, UCN- 16409, which requires the grams of total uranium, the wt % {sup 235 }U, and the grams of {sup 235 }U contained in the shipment. This information is necessary to ensure compliance with Department of Transportation regulations, as well as to ensure that the receiving facility is adhering to its operating license. This characterization study was designed to provide a technical basis for determining these necessary radioactive quantities...|$|R

40|$|Dust {{samples were}} {{collected}} from various roads situated in the Globetown Neighbourhood area of East London. The samples were analyzed for lead, copper, nickel, manganese, iron, and aluminium by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results indicate that lead levels in roads designated as busy are significantly greater than residential roads. The highest lead levels, though, {{were found in the}} vicinity of a car repair workshop. Iron levels in the vicinity of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yards</b> are significantly higher than levels in residential roads. Aluminium levels, a putative indicator of crustal contributions to dustmetal burdens, are significantly greater in residential roads and in the vicinity of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yards</b> compared to busy roads. Manganese, nickel, and copper in dustlevels are evenly dispersed throughout the area. Finally, the results indicate that possible ‘hot spots’ exist which have dusts containing excessively high levels of particular metallic elements...|$|R

40|$|This Masters Exegesis is a {{creative}} practice {{exploration of the}} ordinary/extraordinary life of Andy Stankovich: a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yard</b> worker, a world-class boxer, and an Elvis Presley performer. The King is an observational documentary that follows the journey of Andy and his partner Glenys as they embark on their first New Zealand tour. The narrative of each social actor is constructed around the lead character (Andy Stankovich), framed through {{the perspective of the}} director (Ursula Grace). Certain themes emerged that were integral to the construction of the documentary narrative. Three themes, in particular, recurred throughout the crafting of this thesis: responsible representation, building trust/rapport, during reciprocal processes of listening and self-disclosure, and retaining authenticity during performance and representation. These ideas prevailed throughout all stages of conceptual and practical development...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{his army}} draft card, Johnson {{was born in}} Zachary, Louisiana. He later spoke about his early life and {{conversion}} to the blues in an interview: [...] "I had a good religious father, a good religious mother. They were both members of the Baptist church. I was the onliest jack of the family... So my life was just that way, {{to keep out of}} trouble, drink my little whiskey, and go and do ugly little things like that". Johnson's religious background influenced his later guitar styles; he learned to play the instrument, sometimes laying flat on his knees, in 1927 to undo the boredom of several odd jobs, including cotton picking, concrete mixing, and working in a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yard.</b> Another major influence Johnson credited was reputable Texas blues musician Blind Lemon Jefferson.|$|R

25|$|During {{the night}} of 31 August 2008 or early morning of 1 September 2008, as a weak category-3 {{hurricane}} Gustav approached the coast of Louisiana, at least two clusters of ships were dislodged from their moorings and broke free. The Courier was shown in video coverage {{to be one of}} three vessel grounded on an embankment approaching the L & N railroad bridge near the I-10 'high' bridge. On 3 September 2008, Joel Dupree of Southern <b>Scrap</b> <b>Metal</b> Corp. claimed the Courier has been removed from its position in front of the Almonaster Avenue Bridge and remoored at the <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>yard.</b> Dupree claims the Corps of Engineers were testing locks on the Industrial Canal at the Mississippi river that prevented moving the ships prior to Gustav, and that the Courier was properly anchored during the storm, however the level of the surge and winds were sufficient to break their moorings. The USCG, however, said that it had recommended that ships double-up mooring lines prior to the storm.|$|R
5000|$|Donating <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> {{was another}} {{means by which}} Americans could help support the war effort. Scrap Happy Daffy was a short film that {{encouraged}} such patriotic acts. Daffy defends his <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> against a metal-eating Nazi goat sent by an irate Adolf Hitler. The cartoon asks citizens to donate {{to the war effort}} by listing items which can be given to <b>scrap</b> <b>yards</b> around the country. The cartoon also educates citizens about Hitler’s spies and spoilers who try to hinder such war efforts. [...] Other films pleading for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> include Ding Dong Daddy and Foney Fables.
