[...] The Queen makes half of the presentations after the first lesson, and half after the second. [...] Anthems, led by the Chapel Royal choir and the local choir, are sung while the distribution is going on, concluding with George Frideric Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest. [...] The Royal Maundy service concludes with prayers, [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and the blessing. [...] Two hymns are sung; there is no address. [...] Six silver dishes are used to hold the gifts; one, the traditional Maundy Dish, forms part of the Royal Regalia and is held at the Tower of London when not in use. [...] All six dishes date from the reign of Charles II; five of the six {{have been added to the}} service since 1971. They are held by the Yeomen as the Queen walks about, greeting recipients and giving them their gifts. [...] The Lord High Almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends the Royal Maundy service—a small fee, though payable in Maundy money.|$|E

Draw their minds to the fact of the progressive and still continuing fulfilment of the assurance of a few fishermen, that both their own religion, though of Divine origin, and the religion of their conquerors, which included or recognised all other religious of the known world, should be superseded by the faith in a man recently and ignominiously executed. Then induce them to meditate on the universals of Christian Faith--on Christianity taken as the sum of belief common to Greek and Latin, to Romanist and Protestant. Show them that this and only this is the ordo traditionis, quam tradiderunt Apostoli iis quibus committebant ecclesias, and which we should have been bound to follow, says Irenaeus, si neque Apostoli quidem Scripturas reliquissent. This is that regula fidei, that sacramentum symboli memoriae <b>mandatum,</b> of which St. Augustine says:- noveritis hoc esse Fidei Catholicae fundamentum super quod edificium surrexit Ecclesiae. This is the norma Catholici et Ecclesiastici sensus, determined and explicated, but not augmented, by the Nicene Fathers, as Waterland has irrefragably shown; a norm or model of Faith grounded on the solemn affirmations of the Bishops collected {{from all parts of the}} Roman Empire, that this was the essential and unalterable Gospel received by them from their predecessors in all the churches as the [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] cui, says Irenaeus, assentiunt multae gentes eorum qui in Christum credunt sine charta et atramento, scriptam habentes per Spiritum in cordibus suis salutem, et veterum traditionem diligenter custodientes.

50|$|Faculty of the SII {{clashed with}} {{members and friends}} of USF's Department of Theology who objected to SII's {{practice}} of hiring theology professors for SII classes rather than relying upon the Department of Theology to provide these faculty. The SII rejected interference by the Department of Theology because it wanted to maintain a strong adherence to theological positions loyal to the current Pope and Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church, especially on moral matters such as contraception, abortion, and homosexuality. Eventually {{the differences between the}} SII and the Department of Theology were symbolized by their contrasting responses to Ex Corde Ecclesiae issued by Pope John Paul II in 1990. The papal document called for a <b>mandatum</b> to be signed by professors of Catholic doctrine as a testament to the instructor's orthodoxy. The SII faculty signed the <b>mandatum</b> as a self-defining act.

5000|$|Others theorize {{that the}} English name [...] "Maundy Thursday" [...] arose from [...] "maundsor baskets" [...] or [...] "maundy purses" [...] of alms which {{the king of}} England {{distributed}} to certain poor at Whitehall before attending Mass on that day. Thus, [...] "maund" [...] {{is connected to the}} Latin mendicare, and French mendier, to beg. A source from the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod likewise states that, if the name was derived from the Latin <b>mandatum,</b> we would call the day Mandy Thursday, or Mandate Thursday, or even <b>Mandatum</b> Thursday; and that the term [...] "Maundy" [...] comes in fact from the Latin mendicare, Old French mendier, and English maund, which as a verb means to beg and as a noun refers to a small basket held out by maunders as they maunded. Other sources reject this etymology.|$|E

50|$|Together, Church and Convent {{encompass}} three hectares including 13 cloisters (six of them major), three churches, {{and a large}} courtyard. In total, about 40,000 square {{meters of}} construction. San Francisco follows the classical typology of medieval monasteries. The main Church is the guiding axis and from there the cloister galleries extend: the refectory, the chapterhouse, and winery.

50|$|Ubi caritas is a hymn of the Western Church, long used {{as one of}} the antiphons for {{the washing}} of feet on Maundy Thursday. The Gregorian melody was {{composed}} sometime between the fourth and tenth centuries, though some scholars believe the text dates from early Christian gatherings before the formalization of the Mass. It is usually sung at Eucharistic Adoration and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and on Holy Thursday evening at the Mass of the Lord's Supper. The current Roman Catholic Missal (1970, 3rd typical edition 2000) reassigned it from the foot-washing <b>mandatum</b> to the offertory procession at the Holy Thursday Mass of the Lord's Supper, and it also is found in current Anglican and Lutheran hymnals.|$|E
5000|$|The cantus firmus {{on which}} the mass is based, which was long of mysterious origin, was {{discovered}} by Manfred Bukofzer {{to be from the}} Sarum Rite: the melisma on the last word, [...] "caput", from the antiphon Venit ad Petrum, which was used at the <b>Mandatum</b> ceremony (the Washing of the Feet) on Maundy Thursday during Holy Week. [...] The melisma on the single word is long and dramatic, containing over 100 notes, and spanning the interval of an octave. Within the melisma the melodic interval of the fourth is prominent and is repeated several times, and several modes, including Phrygian, Dorian and Mixolydian, are implied, giving it an extraordinary melodic diversity.|$|E
50|$|Mandate (<b>mandatum</b> or lastgeving) is a {{contract}} {{in which one}} person, the mandatary, undertakes to perform some lawful task for another, the mandator. In Roman-Dutch law, the contract {{was said to be}} essentially gratuitous. If the parties agreed on a payment for the services rendered, the contract was one of letting and hiring of work or services: locatio conductio operis or operarum respectively. It was accepted in practice, however, that the mandator might offer a reward or honorarium, not in payment but in gratitude, for the mandatary's services. There is no objection in modern law to the remuneration of the mandatary, with the result {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish the contract of mandate from that of letting and hiring of work or services.|$|E
5000|$|Maundy (from the Vulgate of John 13:34 [...] meaning [...] "command"), or the Washing of the Feet, is a {{religious}} rite observed by various Christian denominations. The name is taken from the first few Latin words sung at the ceremony of the washing of the feet, [...] "Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos" [...] ("I give you a new commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you") (...) , and from the Latin form of the commandment of Christ that we should imitate His loving humility in the washing of the feet (...) [...] The term <b>mandatum</b> (maundy), therefore, {{was applied to the}} rite of foot-washing on this day of the Christian Holy Week called Maundy Thursday.|$|E
5000|$|The 1495 diet also {{declared}} an Eternal Peace and instituted a supreme court, the Imperial Chamber Court. These acts outlawed private warfare and feuds, {{and created a}} binding judicial mechanism for dispute resolution. This {{had the effect of}} making civil wars a matter of breaching the imperial peace (Reichsfriedensbruch) to be resolved by the courts. It was illegal for any Imperial Estate to assist another that was breaching the peace. Following court rulings, the emperor could issue an [...] "advocates' mandate" [...] (<b>mandatum</b> advocatorium) that identified estates in breach of the peace as [...] "enemies of the empire" [...] (Reichsfeinde) and required other estates to act to bring the enemy to heel. Thus, after a judicial process, the empire could make war on one of its own members that was in breach of the peace.|$|E
