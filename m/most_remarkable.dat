5|$|Dating from 1177 to 1512, Rochester Cathedral has a Norman nave and crypt, and Early English choir. Its <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{feature is}} the rare, exuberantly carved Norman portal, which has, unfortunately, {{suffered}} much damage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> room in {{the suite}} is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by {{craftsmen}} brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> victory which naval annals record.|$|E
40|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>remarkables</b> {{effects of}} {{economic}} globalization is the change {{on the nature}} of work. From the theoretical perspective of operaism, the emphasis is on the communicative and cognitive dimension that characterizes most of the work performance today. Writers as Paolo Virno, Andrea Fumagalli or Franco Berardi use the term cognitive work to refer to the exercise of a set of skills and dispositions that not allude to a specific kind of work, but an increasingly important part of the very nature of work in general...|$|R

5|$|M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones {{argue that}} the rise of {{organised}} sport {{was one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> and distinctive features {{of the history of the}} universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> discoveries {{was that}} the comet had a third type of tail. In {{addition}} to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown {{to come from a}} tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium iodides {{result from}} the oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> is Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a nearly perfect cube.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance {{architecture}} thrived {{during the}} reigns of Frederick II and especially Christian IV. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. In Copenhagen, Rosenborg Castle (1606–24) and Børsen or the former stock exchange (1640) {{are perhaps the}} city's <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> Renaissance buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks founded new {{cities in}} Jordan {{including}} Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Gedara (Umm Qays), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Arbila (Irbid). Later under Roman rule, these cities joined other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and Syria {{to form the}} Decapolis League, a loose confederation linked by economic and cultural interests: Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus were among its members. The <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> Hellenistic site in Jordan is Qasr Al-Abd at Iraq Al-Amir, just west of modern-day Amman.|$|E

5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> discoveries {{of animals and}} plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shishman is {{considered}} a vain, aggressive, and opportunistic ruler, whose Protean foreign policy perhaps contributed to the battle that {{put an end to}} his life. At the same time he was clearly forceful and energetic, overcoming and reversing Bulgaria's losses during the uncertainty that preceded his accession, and managing to maintain internal peace and security within Bulgaria during his short reign. Andreev calls him the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> 14th-century Bulgarian monarch. According to Kantacouzenos he desired to expand the country from Byzantium to the Istros, i. e. from Constantinople to the Danube which makes him the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who effectively attempted to capture the Byzantine capital. He was also the first Bulgarian ruler for decades who tried to lead a more active policy in Macedonia. Michael Shishman's seal is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 2 levs banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.|$|E

5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely last several years.|$|E

25|$|The château is {{furnished}} by {{objects of}} times, styles and origins {{that are very}} different, from between the 15th and 19th centuries, and from Holland to Portugal. The <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> pieces of furniture are perhaps a large armoire from Strasbourg dating from 1700, or a Louis XIII cabinet with marquetry of jasmine flowers. But the <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> part is without any doubt {{the door of the}} vault in solid oak, which comes from the Château de Bury and dates from the French Renaissance.
