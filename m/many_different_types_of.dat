5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were made}} under Lord Tyrawley during his term as governor, but progress was hindered by his confrontational {{relationship with his}} senior engineer, William Skinner. Gibraltar's defences were stronger {{than they had been}} in the earlier siege but still had many deficiencies. The fortress seemed at first sight to be well-armed, with 339 cannon in 1744, but this number concealed the fact that they consisted of at least eight different calibres, some made of brass and some of iron – which meant greatly differing levels of reliability – and they required <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> spares and ammunition, adding to the garrison's logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies {{allowing them to}} interact with many different antigens. It {{has been estimated that}} humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited {{by the size of the}} human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities {{and there has been a}} significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials {{may not always be}} in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} items {{that can be}} picked up {{including}} smoke bombs and C4 explosives, as well as <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> guns including a shotgun and a machine gun. The gun's ammo is limited and is replenished by collecting ten coins which are scattered around the map. In multiplayer mode, the player who collects the coins {{is the only person}} whose gun receives more ammo. Levels can be completed in many different ways based on what characters the player or players choose. When playing in single-player mode, once a character is unlocked it can be used on any level and any level can be completed as any character. In multiplayer mode, players work together to complete the levels. If one of the players dies, another must revive them before finishing the level.|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that takes <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited {{as an example of}} the susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there {{is a type of}} ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
