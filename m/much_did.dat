5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So <b>much</b> <b>did</b> the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he had a}} {{reputation}} for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a canal at Suez would make good relations with Egypt vital to Britain. Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being [...] "born a free, independent American, so <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived". By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.|$|E
500|$|Berg said, [...] " [...] did {{the last}} reel; the band Explosions in the Sky did pretty <b>much</b> <b>did</b> {{everything}} else. They have an emotional, tender quality to their music, {{even when it}} gets aggressive. I didn’t want the score to be overly aggressive, I {{wanted it to be}} haunting and emotional. Steve Jablonsky came in at the end to do something more traditional, but when Steve does [...] "traditional", it's not the usual strings. He created a wonderful sound at the very end." [...] Songs featured in the film include [...] "Canned Heat" [...] by Jamiroquai, and [...] "Heroes" [...] performed by Peter Gabriel and the New Blood Orchestra, which is played {{at the end of the}} film during a four-minute montage that features actual photos and videos of the fallen servicemen.|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} year of her life, Austen revised Northanger Abbey (1817), wrote Persuasion (1817), and began another novel, {{eventually}} titled Sanditon, which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see Northanger Abbey or Persuasion through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a [...] "Biographical Notice of the Author". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: [...] "Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives...o <b>much</b> <b>did</b> she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her [...] public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress." [...] However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.|$|E
500|$|Doggystyle was {{recorded}} in early-1993 at Death Row Studios. It was produced in a style similar to The Chronic; some critics called it a [...] "carbon copy". Snoop Doggy Dogg collaborated with two music groups, 213 and Tha Dogg Pound. Daz Dillinger, of the latter group, accused Dr. Dre of taking sole recognition for producing the album and alleged that Warren G and himself contributed substantially {{to the production of}} the project. Death Row Records co-founder Marion [...] "Suge" [...] Knight stated in 2013 that, [...] "Daz pretty <b>much</b> <b>did</b> the whole album", and that credit was signed over to Dr. Dre for a fee. Snoop Doggy Dogg said Dr. Dre was capable of making beats without the help of collaborators and addressed the issues with Warren G and Daz, stating [...] "They made beats, Dre produced that record". He discussed the track [...] "Ain't No Fun", mentioning that Daz and Warren G brought Dr. Dre the beat but [...] "Dre took that muthafucka to the next level!" [...] Bruce Williams, closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, discussed the recording process during Dre's time at Death Row Records, stating: ...|$|E

Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E

2500|$|The Carthaginians {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties and}} their field forces were virtually eliminated for some time. Some ancient authorities refrain from giving specific numbers, but others give figures between 30,000 and 40,000 {{for the men}} who were killed, and up to 5,000 for those taken alive. Almost all sources (except Cassius Dio) agree that the losses of the Romans were minimal. Polybius wrote: [...] "...it is not possible to find any other disaster which even if exaggerated could be compared with this, so <b>much</b> <b>did</b> it exceed in horror all previous events. Therefore of all the brilliant exploits performed by Scipio this seems to me the most splendid and most adventurous." [...] With one single strike Scipio was able {{to get rid of the}} Carthaginian blockade and to renew the offensive operations of the previous summer. What followed shortly afterwards was the battle of the Great Plains, which ended with another crushing defeat of Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax. Carthage had to recall its armies from Italy for a last decisive encounter that took place in 202 BC, and resulted in a final defeat and a peace treaty, ending the Second Punic War in 201 BC.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1994, {{the band}} issued a seven-track EP, Dick Sandwich. Its cover had [...] "a graphic {{drawing of the}} {{offending}} flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce." [...] Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature {{and told them to}} [...] "grow up". The EP was described as having [...] "good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona" [...] and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, [...] "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" [...] (aka [...] "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a Seven News anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites [...] "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme [...] "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, [...] "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, How <b>Much</b> <b>Did</b> I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182.|$|E
