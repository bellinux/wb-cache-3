40|$|In {{our country}} existed and exists still a {{constant}} concern {{to respect and}} guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially after 1989, when Romania became a member or acceding to international or regional treaties and conventions enshrining such rights. Taking into consideration the importance of respecting human rights, we consider {{that is necessary to}} research how they are secured in Romania, because only when these guarantees are known by their beneficiaries and those involved in their protection, actions which affect these values of humanity can be avoided. In human rights, rules of international law have priority over those entered in the domestic law if they contain provisions which may be interpreted differently on the same matter, unless the Constitution or national laws contain <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>provisions...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} privacy versus data access {{is at the}} {{crossroads}} of the recent legislation on data protection, that extends to all kinds of personal data and their uses. The paper takes {{the point of view of}} an analytical user, i. e. a person wanting to (collect and principally) process micro data for research purposes. It focuses on some basic features of the issue and on their policy implications. First of all, the societal role of scientific research and its intrinsic needs are considered: they are the basis for motivating a "credit of confidentiality" when personal data are processed for scientific purposes. Some basic principles and guidelines for regulating this credit of confidentiality, as they are set out in recent international recommendations and regulations, are then briefly reviewed. The state of the affairs in Italy is discussed: a fairly strict act on data protection was passed in 1996; substantial improvements were introduced by further legislation; a code of conduct has been recently adopted, which is crucial both for a liberal interpretation of the rules and for making them effective (indeed, the <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>provisions</b> dealing with the processing personal data for research purposes were conditional on the code to come into force). The concluding remarks stress the need for additional efforts to make micro databases widely available to researchers...|$|E
40|$|The Convention signed at Lomé on 28 February 1975 {{between the}} nine {{members of the}} European Economic Community and forty-six {{developing}} countries, known as the ACP States, has been hailed as an important advance in economic cooperation {{between rich and poor}} nations. Not only has the number of countries associated with the EEC been raised from the nineteen involved in the earlier Yaoundé Convention, but the ACP countries as a group now appear to enjoy <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>provisions</b> for trade and aid than those obtained under earlier agreements. Among the new ACP States is Ethiopia, a country neither connected with the EEC through previous arrangements nor having any historical links with Europe apart from a brief period of colonial rule by the Italians during 1936 – 41. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the implications of the provisions of the Lomé Convention in relation to Ethiopia. In addition to addressing the major question of local concern, i. e. whether or not Ethiopia is likely to benefit from association, a case study of this country is of more widespread interest. The lessons for Ethiopia may be applicable to other countries with similar circumstances. In addition, on the grounds of absolute poverty the Lomé Convention provides preferential treatment in some areas for certain of the least developed ACP countries, of which Ethiopia is one. The likely benefits of association for Ethiopia may serve, therefore, as an indicator of the extent of the EEC's commitment to assisting the ACP States, and the least developed in particular...|$|E
5000|$|Mohammad Reza Beg was {{the mayor}} of Erivan and a {{high-ranking}} official to {{the governor of the}} Erivan province, when, upon the governments initiative, he was sent in embassy to France, in March 1714. He had to cross Constantinople in the neighboring Ottoman Empire, {{in the guise of a}} pilgim, as the former was often at war with Safavid Iran, and relations were unstable. Being still imprisoned, he was released thanks to the French ambassador in Constantinople, Pierre des Alleurs and his [...] "astute dragoman" [...] Etienne Padery, before being conveyed to Marseille (which he reached on October 23, 1714) and Versailles, where he was lavishly received and with great pomp. On August 13, 1715, he reached a new Treaty with the Louis XIV's government, which, included a <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>provision</b> regarding the French trade. As another result of the diplomatic mission, a permanent Persian consulate was established in Marseille, the main French Mediterranean port for the trade with the East, soon staffed by Hagopdjan de Deritchan.On 19 February 1715, at 11 AM, Mohammad Reza Beg made his entry into the Château de Versailles on horseback with his large retinue, accompanied by the presenter of ambassadors and the lieutenant of the king’s armies. Crowds reportedly filled the avenue de Paris and the courtyards to attend the arrival of the ambassador and his retinue. The courtiers crowded into the Hall of Mirrors, where four tiers of seats had been set up for them. The Hall of Mirrors was packed, with many foreigners present. At the back, Louis XIV on his throne was surrounded by the future Louis XV and his governess, Madame de Ventadour, the Duc d’Orléans Philippe II, and other royal princes. The painter Antoine Coypel and Boze, Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions, stood below the platform to record the event.|$|R
40|$|Judicial {{enforcement}} of foreign annulled awards has engendered fervent debate. Pursuant to Article V(1) (e) of the New York Convention, the enforcement court may refuse to enforce an award {{which has been}} set aside in 2 ̆ 2 the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made. 2 ̆ 2 Yet some enforcement courts have allowed enforcement notwithstanding such annulment, primarily on two bases. The first basis is that Article V(1) (e) is a discretionary ground for non-enforcement. The second basis is that Article VII(1) of the New York Convention allows enforcement {{through the application of}} the <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> law. This paper examines the judicial disparities in determining the enforceability of foreign annulled awards, and explores the reasons for such disparities. It analyses the various approaches to enforcing foreign annulled awards, highlighting any controversies and challenges for the judiciary. It emphasises the need for harmonious and effective interaction between annulment and {{enforcement of}} arbitral awards, as well as between recognition of foreign judgements and foreign awards. It offers recommendations on determining the enforceability of foreign annulled awards under New York Convention Articles V(1) (e) (the annulment exception to enforcement), VII(1) (the <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> enforcement <b>provision)</b> and V(2) (b) (the public policy exception to enforcement) ...|$|R

Recalling the “age” of Article 1 paragraph (2) Indonesian Criminal Code that is so old, there is an urgency to conduct analysis in contemporary perspective whether or not Article 1 paragraph (2) Indonesian Criminal Code can be implemented under the current law regime in Indonesia. In implementing Article 1 paragraph (2) Indonesian Criminal Code, elements that shall be regarded are: (i) defendant; (ii) change of laws and regulations after the crime is committed; (iii) most <b>favourable</b> <b>provision.</b> There should be an adjustment on the method of interpreting both elements of defendant and change of law and regulations; on the other hand, there must be a case-by-case study to answer the element of most <b>favourable</b> <b>provision.</b> Aside from elements of Article 1 paragraph (2) Indonesian Criminal Code, there should also be a consideration on transitional provisions of the changed law {{to determine whether or not}} Article 1 paragraph (2) Indonesian Criminal Code could be implemented...|$|R

40|$|Related {{work was}} {{reviewed}} and fitted into a general scheme. A Thurstone attitude scale {{was constructed in}} a split-half form (19 + 19) to test attitudes to school science and science in general. Another, based on this, was constructed to test attitudes to school physics and physics in general. Reliabilities of both scales were 0. 80 or more. The sample was 1066 pupils aged 11 + years 15 + years in grammar and modern schools. This sample {{was found to be}} significantly favourable to science and the grammar school sample was <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> than the modern school sample. The younger pupils were <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> in attitude than older pupils and boys were <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> to science than girls. The samples were matched for proportions of each sex. Using the attitude to physics scale, 117 fourth-year pupils of four grammar schools which taught physics according to the Nuffield foundation scheme were compared with 117 fourth-year pupils from equivalent streams in four grammar schools which taught physics in a conventional manner. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that the Nuffield scheme produced <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> attitudes to physics than conventional approaches. There was a little evidence to support the view that a conventional approach produced <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> attitudes to physics. Some evidence was presented to show a small, significant and positive correlation between attitude to science and attainment in science. A model for simulating responses to the scales was constructed and compared favourably with the results...|$|R
