40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Systems and Information Technology [© Emerald Group Publishing Limited] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] – In light of a growing trend towards mobile information management and a UK governmental drive for police forces to implement mobile technologies and realise significant benefits, it is important to examine the factors affecting officer acceptance. There appears to be little understanding of the key factors, yet this is {{critical to the success of}} the initiative. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the main factors that influence the usage of <b>mobile</b> technologies amongst <b>police</b> officers. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative, partially ethnographic design was followed to allow an in-depth exploration of this issue. The study was based on a mixed-methods longitudinal evaluation study of the implementation of mobile technologies within a UK police force over a nine-month period. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the subsequent TAM 2 and TAM 3, were then reengineered to provide a suitable theoretical model for a <b>mobile</b> <b>policing</b> context. Findings – In total, four main categories of officer acceptance factors were identified: officer performance, security/reliability, management style and cognitive acceptance. Evidence from the study showed a key shortfall in all three versions of the TAM in that they focus on the user perspective and did not confirm the broader organisational factors within the implementation and social contexts of <b>mobile</b> <b>policing.</b> Originality/value – Consequently, an adapted mobile-TAM(m-TAM) was produced that incorporated these factors into the existing TAM elements. The high-level nature of the adapted model for <b>mobile</b> <b>policing</b> means it could be applied by other police forces and potentially other organisations, regardless of the type of mobile device implemented, to address the barriers to acceptance. The m-TAM addresses the need for a more relevant and robust model to the <b>mobile</b> <b>policing</b> paradigm, which goes beyond the static technology environment in which the TAM 2 and TAM 3 were built...|$|R

5|$|The National Police Directorate, {{located in}} Downtown Oslo, {{is the central}} {{administration}} for the Norwegian Police Service. It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate {{is led by the}} National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar Humlegård. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime is responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases. The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected. The National <b>Mobile</b> <b>Police</b> Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country. Their primary role is as highway patrol and manages the police reserves, although they also assist police districts in extraordinary events where extra manpower is needed or where they are in the vicinity.|$|E

The Angolan PSP was reinforced with <b>mobile</b> <b>police</b> companies deployed by the European Portuguese PSP. The PSP included the Rural Guard, which was responsible for the protection of farms and other agricultural companies. Besides this, the PSP was responsible to frame the district militias, which were employed mainly in the self-defense of villages and other settlements.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 July, groups of British policemen and {{soldiers}} went on the rampage in Tel Aviv, breaking the windows of shops and buses, overturning cars, stealing a taxi and assaulting members of the Jewish community. Groups of young Jews then {{took to the streets}} and started stoning police foot patrols, which were then withdrawn from the city. On learning of the stonings, without waiting for orders, members of <b>mobile</b> <b>police</b> units temporarily based at the Citrus House security compound drove into Tel Aviv in six armoured vehicles. These policemen opened fire on two buses, killing one Jew and injuring three others on the first bus and killing three more Jews on the second. Policemen also beat passersby, smashed shop windows, and raided two cafés, detonating a grenade in one of them. In one café, they attempted to abduct a Jew, and were beaten back by the patrons. Five Jews were killed and 15 injured. The dead were identified as Tova Harson, Victor Yedidia Mizrahi, Ze'ev Noviakovsky, Kalman Reich, and Yosef Azpai.|$|E

25|$|The {{police raid}} on the school, which housed protesters linked to the Genoa Social Forum, took place {{a few minutes before}} midnight when most guests were already asleep. The raid was {{initiated}} by <b>mobile</b> <b>police</b> units from Rome, followed by more units from Genoa and Milan. Battalions of the Carabinieri did not actively participate in the raid, but limited themselves to surround the perimeter and areas adjacent to the school. Mark Covell, a British journalist, was the first person who met the police outside the building and was assaulted, leaving him in a coma. During the raid the police violently attacked those who were in the school, injuring 82 people {{out of a total of}} 93 arrested. Among the arrested, 63 were taken to hospital and 19 were taken to the police station of Bolzaneto. According to the reconstruction of events given in subsequent investigations, evidence was planted after the raid to justify the brutality of the raid. Senior police officers planted two Molotov cocktails recovered elsewhere in the school, delivered to them by General Valerio Donnini that afternoon. Police also planted construction tools, hammers and knives from a nearby construction site and claimed they belonged to anarchist groups housed in the building. A police officer, Massimo Nucera, showed a slash in his bulletproof vest, claiming he was knifed by a violent demonstrator. However, the knife was never identified. He was later convicted of forgery and defamation, and it was later revealed that he cut his own vest to claim resistors were violent, and thus justify the brutality of the raid.|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister Thatcher {{expected}} Scargill {{to force}} a confrontation, and in response she set up a defence in depth. She believed that the excessive costs of increasingly inefficient collieries had to end in order to grow the economy. She planned to close inefficient pits and depend more on imported coal, oil, gas and nuclear. She appointed hardliners to key positions, set up a high level planning committee, and allocated funds from the highly profitable electrical supply system to stockpile {{at least six months}} worth of coal. Thatcher's team set up <b>mobile</b> <b>police</b> units so that forces from outside the strike areas could neutralise efforts by flying pickets to stop the transport of coal to power stations. It used the National Recording Centre (NRC), set up in 1972 by the Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales linking 43 police forces to enable police forces to travel to assist in major disturbances. [...] Scargill played into her hands by ignoring the buildup of coal stocks and calling the strike at the end of winter when demand for coal was declining. His refusal to hold a strike ballot weakened support from other unions and the general public. Without a national ballot, miners in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, South Derbyshire, North Wales and parts of Lancashire kept working and Scargill sent flying pickets to prevent them. The police provided protection for working miners.|$|E
