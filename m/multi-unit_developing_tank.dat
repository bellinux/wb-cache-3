50|$|A <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> is a {{light-tight}} container {{used for}} developing film. A <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> allows photographic film {{to be developed}} in a daylight environment. This is necessary because most film is panchromatic and therefore can not be exposed to any light during processing. Depending upon the size and type, a <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> can hold one to many roll or sheet films.Famous brands include Paterson, Jobo and Nikor.A film reel holds roll films in a spiral shape. The film is held evenly spaced so that the chemicals in the <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> reach all of the film.|$|R

50|$|While the British {{took the}} lead in tank development, the French were not far behind and fielded their first tanks in 1917. The Germans, on the other hand, were slower to <b>develop</b> <b>tanks,</b> concentrating on {{anti-tank}} weapons.|$|R
50|$|The user {{begins by}} opening the film {{canister}} (in {{the case of}} 35 mm film) or separating the film from a paper backing (in the case of medium format film, e.g. 120/220 format). The film is then loaded onto a film reel in a completely dark environment; {{this can be a}} light-tight room or a changing bag. Care must be taken during this step, as improperly loading the film may result in parts of the film not getting developed. Once the film is on the reel it is put into the <b>developing</b> <b>tank,</b> and then a lid is placed on the <b>developing</b> <b>tank.</b> Because the lid prevents light from reaching the film, the rest of the film developing process may be carried out in daylight. In addition to protecting the film from light, the lid contains an opening for rapidly pouring liquids {{into and out of the}} <b>developing</b> <b>tank.</b> Finally, a separate cap seals the canister, which prevents the contents of the tank from spilling when agitated by inverting the tank.But the tank should be cleaned by water every time after development as any residual fixer may not lead to proper development of the next film.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of tanks in World War I {{began as an}} attempt to break the stalemate which trench warfare had brought to the Western Front. The British and French both began experimenting in 1915, and deployed tanks in battle from 1916 and 1917 respectively. The Germans, on the other hand, were slower to <b>develop</b> <b>tanks,</b> concentrating on anti-tank weapons.|$|R

The negative size was 10x14 mm for the earlier models, later, a larger format, 12x17 mm was adopted, using single-perforated 16 mm film. It was possible to load your own cassettes, and also develop the film using a special <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> with a spiral insert for 16 mm film.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{recognized}} the importance of tanks {{at the beginning of the}} war. Heinz Guderian, one of Germany's best commanders during World War II largely helped the development of Panzer forces and the organization of tanks into divisions. Hitler at first <b>developed</b> <b>tanks</b> to be used as a propaganda tool, since many thought them to be impressive. However, the effectiveness and power that tanks held caused further development for more powerful tanks.|$|R

He went on to attend the University of Wales at Swansea (now Swansea University) in the early 1940s at the start of World War II. He {{received}} a B.S. in physics in 1943. He did not attend graduate school, instead deciding to join the Fighting Vehicles Research Establishment where he served between 1943 and 1947 <b>developing</b> <b>tank</b> fire-control systems.|$|R

50|$|The Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe {{restrictions}} upon Germany constructing {{vehicles for}} military purposes, and so throughout the 1920s and 1930s, German arms manufacturers and the Wehrmacht had begun secretly <b>developing</b> <b>tanks.</b> As these vehicles were produced in secret, their technical specifications and battlefield potentials were largely {{unknown to the}} European Allies until the war actually began. When German troops invaded the Benelux nations and France in May 1940, German weapons technology proved to be immeasurably superior {{to that of the}} Allies.|$|R
50|$|A {{changing}} bag is a photographic bag {{specifically designed to}} be light-proof while in use. It is required for certain applications involving photosensitive materials when a darkroom is not available, like in the field. Common usages include removing film from its canister {{to put it into}} a <b>developing</b> <b>tank,</b> or loading and unloading sheet film holders. They are also commonly found on the set of a film, where the clapper loader may need one if shooting on location or far away from a darkroom.|$|R
50|$|The 1st Panzer Division {{was formed}} on 15 October 1935 from the 3rd Cavalry Division, and was {{headquartered}} in Weimar. It {{was one of}} three tank divisions created at the time, the other two being the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Division. Germany had renounced the Treaty of Versailles earlier in the year which had forbidden the country, among other things, from having tank forces, a treaty Germany had violated almost from the start by secretly <b>developing</b> <b>tanks</b> and operating a covert tank school in the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|Tanks {{were adapted}} {{to a wide}} range of {{military}} tasks, including engineering. Specialized models, such as flame-thrower tanks, armored recovery vehicles for towing disabled tanks, and command tanks with extra radios were also used. Some of these tank variants live on as other classes of armored fighting vehicle, no longer called [...] "tanks". All major combatant powers also <b>developed</b> <b>tank</b> destroyers and assault guns, as armored vehicles carrying large-caliber guns, but often no turrets. Turreted vehicles are expensive to manufacture compared to non-turreted vehicles.|$|R

(Although Britain did <b>develop</b> <b>tanks,</b> they came from a separate source and were not directly influenced by Holt machines.
