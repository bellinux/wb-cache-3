5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
25|$|Most Egyptian Christians are Copts, who {{are mainly}} {{members of the}} Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Although Copts in Egypt speak Egyptian Arabic, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not {{consider}} themselves to be ethnically Arabs, but rather descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The Copts constitute the largest population of Christians in the Middle East, numbering between 8,000,000 and 15,000,000. The liturgical language of the Copts, the Coptic language, is a direct descendant of the Egyptian language. Coptic remains the liturgical language of all Coptic churches.|$|E
25|$|Some who {{advocate}} against greater government involvement in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% of undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance.|$|E

25|$|The CNDH {{suggested}} after Bermúdez Zacarías' {{murder to}} create a policy to have judges handle cases anonymously {{in order to protect}} their identity. They argued that by having this policy in place, judges would be able to preside over cases impartially and without being intimidated. This method was used in Peru, Colombia, and Italy to protect judges who faced threats from armed groups. The Mexican government stated that they would debate and consider the proposal as an option, but said that accepting the policy would mean that they were giving in to the pressures from organized crime. Moreover, the 2016 judicial reform – the New Criminal Justice System (Spanish: Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal, NSJP) – advocated for greater judicial transparency, a move that was seen at odds with the proposed policy. When Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered, only 70 out of 1,391 federal judges had security measures in place to protect them from attacks. Several judges advocated for more security measures, but this also posed several challenges because of the limited resources and long processes that would need to take place for such budgets to be approved by politicians. Local judges, however, do not enjoy the level of protection that their federal counterparts have, and attacks from organized crime members are more prevalent. In addition, most of the cases involving attacks or intimidation against judges are not reported to the police. If the cases are filed to the police, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not reach a court of law and are closed without imparting justice.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the government, {{through the}} National AIDS/HIV Control Program (NACP), {{conducted}} its first ever study {{of men who}} have sex with other men (MSM). The study found that although society may be very quick to label these men as [...] "gay", <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not connect their sexual practices with being [...] "gay", instead insisting on a heterosexual identity. The study also found that having multiple male sexual partners and bisexuality are very common among MSM. The HIV infection rate among MSM was 7.5 percent, more than five times the national HIV prevalence, [...] "which means that MSM communities are important drivers of [...] HIV epidemic in the country. MSM are mostly found to have concurrent sexual relationships with the opposite sex. This enables a cycle of HIV transmission in the most likely occurrence of multiple sexual partnering. This is a great threat to public health in general and has become a priority concern of ... and NACP. High HIV prevalence amongst MSM cannot be blamed on their sexual practices per se." ...|$|E

60|$|But in {{this study}} of the plutocratic mind, always so {{fascinating}} to me, I am getting altogether away from what I meant to tell you.

A great <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not house themselves at all, but that is a class which we cannot now consider, and I will speak only of those who have some sort of a roof over their heads.|$|E

60|$|When {{once the}} kingdom {{is reduced to}} such a condition, I {{will tell you what}} must be the end: The gentlemen of estates will all turn off their tenants for want of payment, because as I told you before, the tenants are obliged by their leases to pay {{sterling}} which is lawful current money of England; then they will turn their own farmers, as too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> already, run all into sheep where they can, keeping only such other cattle as are necessary, then they will be their own merchants and send their wool and butter and hides and linen beyond sea for ready money and wine and spices and silks. They will keep only a few miserable cottiers.[23] The farmers must rob or beg, or leave their country. The shopkeepers in this and every other town, must break and starve: For it is the landed man that maintains the merchant, and shopkeeper, and handicraftsman.|$|E
