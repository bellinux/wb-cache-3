One has to entertain, and one forgets the serious {{business}} of lunching. I will take <b>my</b> <b>coffee</b> and cigarette in peace." ...|$|E

6000|$|George chuckled softly. [...] "Well," [...] he declared, [...] "when anyone up {{and says}} <b>my</b> <b>coffee's</b> only fit for the hog-pen, I'm going to get even with him. I kind of feel I have to. It's up to me." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Coffee!</b> <b>My,</b> {{how good}} it smelled. Billy's mouth watered. But the voice--that {{interested}} Billy {{almost as much as}} the preparations for the coming meal.|$|R
60|$|I {{nodded and}} drank <b>my</b> <b>coffee.</b> Grooton was {{watching}} me {{with an air of}} respectful interest.|$|E

60|$|March 15.--It {{is eight}} in the morning--and I hardly know how to employ myself. Having {{finished}} <b>my</b> <b>coffee,</b> I have just looked again at my diary.|$|E

60|$|I remembered. His {{handsome}} old face, {{so fresh}} for his age, unmarked by any trying experience, appeared haggard for an instant. It {{was like the}} passing of a shadow. Returning his steadfast gaze, I {{took a sip of}} <b>my</b> black <b>coffee.</b> He was systematically minute in his narrative, simply in order, I think, not to let his excitement get the better of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could keep still, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "There is an inquietude in your very pose that unsettles me, and with a little fortitude one can get used to anything. For instance, if anybody had told me five years ago that I could take <b>my</b> after-dinner <b>coffee</b> without a slight flavour of old cognac I should not have {{believed}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this my brother's daughter?" [...] {{he asked}} himself. [...] "The {{little girl who}} poured <b>my</b> <b>coffee</b> {{in the morning and}} went out to take toll?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last Tuesday," [...] {{said the}} dogman, [...] "he bit {{me on the}} ankle because I asked for cream in <b>my</b> <b>coffee.</b> He always gets the cream." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, you selfish young zany of a man, {{after all}} you have said to her, won't you make it up and let me return to <b>my</b> <b>coffee?</b> Not he.|$|E
60|$|My own untasted liqueur was on {{the table}} by the side of <b>my</b> empty <b>coffee</b> cup. I made her drink it, and her teeth ceased to chatter. She was rather a pathetic object. One of her little black satin {{slippers}} was cut to shreds, and the other was clogged with wet sand. The fear of Ray, too, was in her white face. She caught hold of my hand impulsively.|$|R
60|$|Oh <b>My</b> {{served the}} <b>coffee</b> at his desk, {{and made no}} sign even after a glance to the porch at the bed which had not been slept in--all of which control Dick {{permitted}} himself privily to admire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder where}} it happened," [...] Spencer said reflectively. [...] "I {{have been on}} my guard all the time. I have watched <b>my</b> wine and <b>coffee</b> at the cafés, and I have eaten only in the {{restaurants}} that I know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sister Mary," [...] said Pierre, {{returned}} from his sunrise stroll, and tapping at his mother's chamber door:--"do you know, sister Mary, that the trees which have been up all night, are all abroad again this morning before you?--Do you not smell something like <b>coffee,</b> <b>my</b> sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What? Well, yes, {{this is good}} coffee, too. If {{they don't}} know much, [...] They do {{know how to make}} coffee, I will say that for these Dutch. [...] But my--oh, my! It ain't the kind of <b>coffee</b> <b>my</b> mother made, [...] And the <b>coffee</b> <b>my</b> wife used to make would throw it clear in the shade; [...] And the brand of sugar-cured, canvased ham that she always used-- [...] Well, this Westphalia stuff would simply have made her amused! [...] That so, heigh? I saw that you was United States as soon [...] As ever I heard you talk; I reckon I know the tune! [...] Pick it out anywhere; and you {{understand}} how I feel [...] About these here foreign breakfasts: breakfast is my best meal.|$|R
6000|$|For I {{have known}} them all already, known them all: [...] Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, [...] I have {{measured}} out <b>my</b> life with <b>coffee</b> spoons; [...] I know the voices dying with a dying fall [...] Beneath {{the music from}} a farther room. [...] So how should I presume? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could have}} thrown my bootjack at him (it lay ready on the rug), for having {{entrapped}} {{me into the}} disclosure of anything concerning Agnes, however immaterial. But I only drank <b>my</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mortimer {{had stayed}} to dinner, {{and he and}} the baronet played ecarté afterwards. The butler brought me <b>my</b> <b>coffee</b> into the library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur {{is not too}} gallant," [...] she murmured, [...] "but one is {{inclined}} to forgive him. If I may take <b>my</b> <b>coffee,</b> I will go. Monsieur has promised me that he will call and see Madame?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was only}} {{too eager to}} explain, and she did it with so much {{volubility}} and at such great length that I, who am good for nothing till I have had <b>my</b> cup of <b>coffee</b> in the morning, almost perished of an elucidation which the Altrurian bore with the sweetest patience.|$|R
40|$|The number pi {{is defined}} as the {{quotient}} of a circular object’s circumference with its diameter. In 5 th or sixth grade (I can’t quite remember) the teacher asked us to take round objects (coffee cups, pots, balls, whatever we could find) and do this measurement. In preparing this essay, I just repeated this age old exercise, with <b>my</b> own <b>coffee</b> cup and a little round device which measures the humidity in my office (a hygrometer). Table 1 shows what I measured with a primitive tape measure. C and d denote measured perimeter and diameter, q the computed quotient...|$|R

60|$|Of course I did not read. How could I? Nor did I sleep. My mind ran on, and on, and {{not until}} the steward brought <b>my</b> <b>coffee,</b> shortly before five, did I sink into my first doze.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bein' {{short on}} milk myself, an' not over much sugar, I doctored three of your cans with water, which went {{to make the}} candles. An' by the bye, I had milk in <b>my</b> <b>coffee</b> for a month to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did I! I {{fixed it}} so that one sip would have an {{insomnia}} patient in dreamland before {{he had time to}} say [...] "Good night". That stuff Rip Van Winkle drank had nothing on <b>my</b> <b>coffee.</b> And all wasted! Well, well!' ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{finishing}} recording {{their debut}} single, Hair and Teeth / Flooded Meadows, the band immediately moved toward writing their first LP, The Sun Exploding. The band recording the album themselves at their studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, called Spaceman Sound. Says vocalist/guitarist Tom Tierney, [...] "Our {{goal was to}} make a record that sounds big, but mostly sounds like the three of us playing our music in our space." [...] When it came time for mixing, the band turned to Andrew Schneider (Pelican, Cave-In, Made out of Babies), who had recorded and mixed the band's aforementioned 7". [...] "Andrew makes great sounding records and his studio is a block from <b>my</b> favorite <b>coffee</b> shop in Brooklyn. It's always a pleasure to go down there and work with him," [...] says drummer Francis Mark.|$|R

I had an additional reason for that belief {{in the fact that}} all the cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her <b>coffee.</b> <b>My</b> attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some 'salt' on the tray of coco which she took every night to Mrs. Inglethorp's room. I accordingly secured a sample of that coco, and sent it to be analysed." ...|$|R
