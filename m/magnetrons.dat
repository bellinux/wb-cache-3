40|$|A novel <b>magnetron</b> {{sputtering}} system, {{which included}} simply designed two grids between target and substrate, {{was developed in}} our laboratory for the synthesis of high-density MgO films. In order to investigate the effect of grids assisted <b>magnetron</b> sputtering, MgO films were deposited by conventional <b>magnetron,</b> one grid assisted <b>magnetron</b> and two grids assisted <b>magnetron.</b> The saturated ion current density and Mg ion fraction in MgO discharges generated by grids assisted <b>magnetron</b> were increased in comparison with those obtained in conventional <b>magnetron,</b> which means that grids assisted <b>magnetron</b> led to the enhancement of plasma density.

50|$|The great {{advance in}} <b>magnetron</b> design was the cavity <b>magnetron</b> or electron-resonance <b>magnetron,</b> which works on entirely {{different}} principles.

5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the <b>magnetrons</b> for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, <b>magnetrons,</b> traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity <b>magnetrons</b> and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E

In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction Finder. He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original magnetron that generated 25centimetre microwave radiation. These <b>magnetrons</b> were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant's {{group at}} Birmingham worked on {{developing}} two promising devices, the klystron and the magnetron. Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , {{just the kind of}} short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational <b>magnetrons</b> were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>magnetrons</b> have {{beryllium}} oxide (beryllia) ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested.

40|$|Reactive <b>magnetron</b> {{sputtering}} processes {{have gained}} considerable {{interest for the}} production of precision optical coatings. Pulsed sputtering techniques allow the deposition of high quality optical materials at high deposition rates. However, under high throughput conditions and with tight spectral tolerances, process stabilization has to be included ill the fabrication process. Normally, pulsed <b>magnetron</b> sputter techniques are typically characterized by a low ionization. Very recently, ionized <b>magnetron</b> sputtering techniques are under investigation, where either the reactive gas or the metallic sputtered particles are highly ionized. Plasma assisted reactive <b>magnetron</b> sputtering ("PARMS") using an additional plasma source or the high pulse power <b>magnetron</b> sputtering ("HiPIMS" or "HPPMS") can be applied therefore.

40|$|An {{inverted}} cylindrical sputter <b>magnetron</b> device {{has been}} developed. The <b>magnetron</b> is {{acting as a}} metal vapor supply for an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source.

Spatially resolved double Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy measurements show an increase in electron density by one order of magnitude from 1 × 1010 cm− 3 to 1 × 1011 cm− 3, when the <b>magnetron</b> plasma is exposed to the magnetic mirror field of the ECR ion source. Electron density enhancement is also indicated by <b>magnetron</b> plasma emission photography with a CCD camera. Furthermore, photographs visualize the formation of a localized loss-cone - area, when the <b>magnetron</b> is operated at magnetic mirror field conditions.

25|$|Some <b>magnetrons</b> have ceramic {{insulators}} with {{beryllium oxide}} (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides {{is a serious}} chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or <b>magnetrons</b> should not be handled. This is a danger if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled, yet not during normal usage.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{magnetron}} is {{a fairly}} efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and {{the properties of the}} cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band <b>magnetrons</b> can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75kW. Some large <b>magnetrons</b> are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.|$|E

25|$|Klystrons and <b>magnetrons</b> often operate their anodes (called {{collectors}} in klystrons) {{at ground}} potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, {{which saw}} the {{development}} of high-power microwave emitters known as cavity <b>magnetrons,</b> {{the idea of using}} microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.|$|E
