25|$|Although D Company {{ultimately}} prevailed {{they would}} have been defeated {{were it not for the}} timely arrival of the cavalry and the availability of significant artillery support. The Australians had come close to disaster and the battle brought home the dangers of a dismounted platoon or company being overwhelmed, while several deficiencies had been evident in 1 ATF's preparation and response. As the fighting began there was no ready reaction force available at Nui Dat, resulting in a lengthy delay reinforcing D Company. After Long Tan a rifle company with armoured support was dedicated to this role, on standby to respond to an attack or exploit any opportunity. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong had been armed with weapons at least equal to those used by the Australians. Most had carried modern Soviet assault rifles, as well as a large quantity of ammunition, which allowed them to sustain a high rate of fire. In contrast, the amount of ammunition carried by the Australians had been insufficient, and following the battle the <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> was increased to 140 rounds per rifle and 500 for each machine-gun. Equally the aerial resupply of D Company had been delayed because there were no prepacked ammunition available. This also changed, while rounds would also be supplied loaded in magazines for quick use. The Viet Cong had also used 60mm mortars, but they were no longer standard equipment for Australian rifle companies, and although battalions were issued 81mm mortars they were controlled by Support Company. Such weapons would afford integral fire support in situations where their opponents had closed within the safety distance of the artillery, and consideration was given to their re-issue. Yet the added weight would limit the ability of sub-units to patrol and M-79 grenade launchers were issued instead, while a number of APCs were modified as mortar carriers.|$|E

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behavior}} of Ti- 1100 is analyzed at elevated temperatures {{to evaluate the}} effects of mechanical and environmental variables. Experiments conducted {{over a wide range}} of frequencies from 0. 01 Hz to 200 Hz indicate a strong dependence of the growth rate upon cyclic loading frequency. Superposition of hold time at maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>loads</b> over a baseline 1. 0 Hz cyclic loading frequency produces an insignificant variation in crack growth rate, which may be attributed to the combined effects of enhanced environmental degradation, crack-tip blunting and increased asperity-induced closure level in this material. It is deduced that a hold time at maximum load results in an interaction of the environmental effects with a retardation effect due to a crack tip blunting as a consequence of creep under maximum applied load, whereas for hold at <b>minimum</b> <b>loads,</b> extensive crack-branching and micro-cracking appear to enhance crack closure loads resulting in lower crack growth rates. A linear superposition model is employed to account for the complex interactions due to fatigue, creep and environmental degradation...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{striation}} spacing {{may be related to the}} crack growth rate, da/dN, through Paris equation, as well as the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>loads</b> under service loading conditions. These loads define the load ratio, R, and are considered impossible to be evaluated from the inter-spacing striations analysis. In this way, this study discusses the methodology proposed by Furukawa to evaluate the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>loads</b> based on the experimental fact that the relative height of a striation, H, and the striation spacing, s, are strongly influenced by the load ratio, R. Fatigue tests in C(T) specimens were conducted on SAE 7475 -T 7351 Al alloy plates at room temperature and the results showed a straightforward correlation between the parameters H, s, and R. Measurements of striation height, H, were performed using scanning electron microscopy and field emission gun (FEG) after sectioning the specimen at a large inclined angle to amplify the height of the striations. The results showed that for increasing R the values of H/s tend to increase. Striation height, striation spacing, and load ratio correlations were obtained, which allows one to estimate service loadings from fatigue fracture surface survey...|$|R

The [...] "10…90…10%" [...] specification states that the <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> is 10% of maximum current and the full load is 90% and the specification test includes taking the load back to 10%.
