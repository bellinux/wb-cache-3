40|$|The {{insect pests}} of maize and their losses were studied in KARINA Juglote, Northern Areas. Maize stem borer Chilo Partellus was found serious pest with 24. 5 % plant {{infestation}} followed by <b>maize</b> <b>aphid</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis with 15 % plant infestation at tasseling stage. Shootfly Atherigona soccata attack {{at the early}} stage with 5 % plant infestation. At the same time, Maize Jassid Zygenia sp was also recorded with population 5 jassids/ 3 sweep net. About 1112 Kg ha - 1 grain losses has been calculated due to these insect pests...|$|E
40|$|Aphid, a {{specialized}} phloem sap-feeding insect, {{is one of}} the major pests of a number of economic important crops, including soybean, cotton, and <b>maize.</b> <b>Aphid</b> can have devastating effects on the crop production by limiting plant growth, as well as serving as vectors for disease. Therefore, research on identification of plant resistance mechanisms to aphid is important for crop improvement. Here, I have developed a system consisting of Arabidopsis thaliana and green peach aphids (Myzus persicae) to study plant-aphid interaction. In my research project, the role of BIK 1 was investigated in Arabidopsis infested with the green peach aphid. Loss of BIK 1 function adversely impacted aphid settling, feeding and reproduction. Relative to wild-type plants, bik 1 displayed higher aphid-induced H 2 O 2 accumulation and more severe lesions, resembling a hypersensitive response (HR) against pathogens. Basal as well as induced salicylic acid and ethylene accumulation were in in the bik 1 mutant. Intriguingly, elevated salicylic acid levels did not contribute to the HR-like symptoms or to the heightened aphid resistance associated with the bik 1 mutant. Elevated ethylene levels in bik 1 accounted for an initial, short-term repellence. Introducing a loss-of-function mutation in the aphid resistance and senescence-promoting gene PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD 4) into the bik 1 background blocked both aphid resistance and HR-like symptoms, indicating bik 1 -mediated resistance to aphids is PAD 4 -dependent. Taken together, Arabidopsis BIK 1 confers susceptibility to aphid infestation through its suppression of PAD 4 expression. Furthermore, the results underscore the role of ROS and cell death in plant defense against phloem sap-feeding insects...|$|E
40|$|Orius majusculus Reuter (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) is an {{important}} component of the pest predatory complex in arable crops in Mediterranean areas. It moves between crops searching for prey, and improving knowledge on its dispersal abilities will help to develop conservation biological control strategies. Stable isotope ratios may be used as a tool for tracking insect movements, as the isotopic composition of insect tissues changes to reflect that of their diet when they undergo dietary shifts on moving between isotopically distinct crops. We carried out laboratory diet switch experiments with a stable isotope approach to infer information on dispersal of O. majusculus individuals among C 3 and C 4 crops to better understand isotopic field data collections. Switching the aphid food source caused a quick change in delta C- 13 signatures, regardless of the original and final food source. Changes in the delta C- 13 ratio of O. majusculus after diet switching fitted with an exponential model that showed similar turnover rates, and thus half-lives, between shifting diets up to 20 days. Subsequently, whereas individuals feeding on C 4 aphids did not survive, turnover rate decreased in individuals that switched from C 4 to C 3 aphids. However, delta C- 13 traces from the original source remained in the predator until 25 days after switching, and this is enough time to help determine the movement of O. majusculus between crops in the field and to plan the timing of predator sampling and crop practices that may enhance predator ecological services. Orius majusculus that switched to a <b>maize</b> <b>aphid</b> diet showed different turnover rates between sexes, although this did not influence the pattern of switchover...|$|E
50|$|Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus {{is spread}} by seed, by {{infected}} leaves rubbing on non-infected leaves {{and perhaps most}} commonly, via aphids (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). These aphids become carriers after they feed on plants such as Johnson grass, corn or sorghum, or other grass species that are infected with MDMV. Broadleaf plants do not become infected with MDMV (The CIMMYT <b>Maize</b> Program). <b>Aphids</b> transmit <b>Maize</b> Dwarf Mosaic Virus disease effectively fifteen to thirty minutes after feeding on infected plants when by spreading the virus to the susceptible plants after they have flown or are blown onto a nearby corn crop and will start to feed (“Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,” n.d.).|$|R
40|$|Predatory beetles are an {{important}} component of the natural enemy complex that preys on insect pests such as aphids within agroecosystems. Tracing diet origins and movement of natural enemies aids understanding their role in the food web and informs strategies for their effective conservation. Field sampling and laboratory experiments were carried out to examine the changes of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C- 13 and delta N- 15) among crops (cotton and maize), pests (cotton and <b>maize</b> <b>aphids),</b> and between wing and abdomen of predatory beetles, Propylea japonica, and to test the hypothesis that prey origins, proportions and feeding periods of the predatory beetles can be deduced by this stable isotope analysis. Results showed that the delta C- 13 values both in wing and abdomen of adult P. japonica were changing from a C- 3 - to a C- 4 -based diet of <b>aphids</b> reared on <b>maize</b> or cotton, respectively; the isotope ratio of their new C- 4 substrates were detectable within 7 days and the delta N- 15 values began to reflect their new C- 4 substrates within 3 days. The relationship between delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 values of P. japonica adults in wing or abdomen and diets of aphids from a C- 3 -based resource transitioning to a C- 4 -based resource were described best in linear or quadratic equations. Results suggest that integrative analysis of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 values can be regarded as a useful method for quantifying to trace prey origins, proportions of diets and feeding periods of natural enemies. The results can provide quantifying techniques for habitat management of natural enemies. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Plants differ {{greatly in}} their {{susceptibility}} to insect herbivory, suggesting both local adaptation and resistance tradeoffs. We used maize (Zea mays) recombinant inbred lines to map a {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) for the <b>maize</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum maidis) susceptibility to maize Chromosome 1. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the same locus was also associated {{with high levels of}} 2 -hydroxy- 4, 7 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one glucoside (HDMBOA-Glc) and low levels of 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxy- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one glucoside (DIMBOA-Glc). In vitro enzyme assays with candidate genes from the region of the QTL identified three O-methyltransferases (Bx 10 a-c) that convert DIMBOA-Glc to HDMBOA-Glc. Variation in HDMBOA-Glc production was attributed to a natural CACTA family transposon insertion that inactivates Bx 10 c in maize lines with low HDMBOA-Glc accumulation. When tested with a population of 26 diverse maize inbred lines, R. maidis produced more progeny on those with high HDMBOA-Glc and low DIMBOA-Glc. Although HDMBOA-Glc was more toxic to R. maidis than DIMBOA-Glc in vitro, BX 10 c activity and the resulting decline of DIMBOA-Glc upon methylation to HDMBOA-Glc were associated with reduced callose deposition as an aphid defense response in vivo. Thus, a natural transposon insertion appears to mediate an ecologically relevant trade-off between the direct toxicity and defense-inducing properties of maize benzoxazinoids...|$|R
40|$|Concerns about {{possible}} undesired {{environmental effects of}} transgenic crops have prompted numerous evaluations of such crops. So-called Bt crops receive particular attention because they carry bacteria-derived genes coding for insecticidal proteins that might negatively affect non-target arthropods. Here we show a remarkable positive effect of Bt maize {{on the performance of}} the corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis, which in turn enhanced the performance of parasitic wasps that feed on aphid honeydew. Within five out of six pairs that were evaluated, transgenic maize lines were significantly more susceptible to aphids than their near-isogenic equivalents, with the remaining pair being equally susceptible. The aphids feed from the phloem sieve element content and analyses of this sap in selected maize lines revealed marginally, but significantly higher amino acid levels in Bt maize, which might partially explain the observed increased aphid performance. Larger colony densities of aphids on Bt plants resulted in an increased production of honeydew that can be used as food by beneficial insects. Indeed, Cotesia marginiventris, a parasitoid of lepidopteran pests, lived longer and parasitized more pest caterpillars in the presence of aphid-infested Bt maize than in the presence of aphid-infested isogenic maize. Hence, depending on aphid pest thresholds, the observed increased susceptibility of Bt <b>maize</b> to <b>aphids</b> may be either a welcome or an undesirable side effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of the black}} bean aphid, Aphis fabae check for this species in other resources scop. (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its colonization of common beans (phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown as sole crop and as intercrops with maize (Zea mays check for this species in other resources L.) of varying growth stages was evaluated {{in the field and}} glasshouse. Modification of bean micro-climate and its effects on A. fabae, and the species range and abundance of coccinellid predators (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) of the aphid were also assessed. Results showed that A. fabae infestation of beans was greatly reduced when intercropped with older and taller maize plants. Larger maize plants interfered with aphid colonization of beans and only small proportions of beans were infested by the aphid. Shading by older maize plants significantly (P? 0. 01) reduced the level of solar radiation reaching intercropped beans; this reduced the build-up of A. fabae populations. Intercropping also reduced the number and diversity of coccinellid predators on beans, contrary to the prediction based on the "enemies hypothesis". Reduced aphid incidence on intercrop beans was attributed to <b>maize</b> interference with <b>aphid</b> host finding behavior and bean colonization and, to a lesser extent, to reduced build-up of A. fabae populations due to shading.

40|$|The corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is an {{occasional}} pest of maize, Zea mays L. Corn leaf <b>aphid</b> damage in <b>maize</b> {{has been characterized}} in whorl-stage plants, but seedling damage has not been investigated. Resistance mechanisms in maize to corn leaf aphids are not well understood. The objectives of these studies were to determine the role of DIMBOA (2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxyl- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one) in maize resistance to corn leaf aphids, to document corn leaf aphid feeding damage on seedling maize, and to characterize feeding behavior differences on seedling and whorl-stage maize;Inbred 41 : 2504 B (high DIMBOA) was colonized by corn leaf aphids immediately upon seedling emergence. Inbreds B 73 and B 37 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the three- and six-leaf stages, respectively. Inbreds C 103 and Mo 17 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the six- and seven-leaf stages, respectively. Regression and partial correlation analysis showed no relationship between corn leaf aphid colonization and DIMBOA. These data indicate that DIMBOA is not a primary resistance factor in maize to corn leaf aphids;Corn leaf aphid feeding on coleoptile and two-leaf stage maize plants reduced plant height and delayed pollen shedding and silking. Grain fill was reduced when aphids fed on coleoptile, two-leaf, and four-leaf stage maize. Grain fill reductions occurred on inbreds B 37, C 103, and 41 : 2504 B, but not on B 73 and Mo 17. Corn leaf aphid damage on seedling maize resulted in yield reductions;Examination of late-whorl stage and seedling maize indicated that 57 % of the corn leaf aphid stylet tracks penetrated late-whorl stage plants through stomata. Eighty-six percent of stylet penetrations in seedling maize occurred intercellularly between epidermal cells and 8 % through the stomata. Fifty-seven percent and 79 % of the stylet tracks terminated in phloem in whorl-stage and seedling <b>maize,</b> respectively. <b>Aphid</b> damaged stomata may be important in explaining yield reductions in heavily infested water stressed maize;These findings indicate that corn leaf aphids were capable of feeding on and damaging seedling maize, and that resistance mechanisms in maize to the corn leaf aphid do not involve the secondary plant chemical DIMBOA...|$|R
