50|$|Disadvantages: SMA {{mixtures}} {{typically have}} a higher initial cost compared to other mixtures. SMA mixtures contain more asphalt (6% minimum) compared to conventional mixtures. The asphalt used in SMA mixtures contains a high amount of polymers (or asphalt rubber as an option). In addition to the polymers, SMA mixtures {{require the use of}} fibers (not required with asphalt rubber), <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> and may require the use of lime. All of these additives not only add to the initial cost but they often require that the producer make modifications to their typical HMA production processes. SMA mixtures may also require higher quality aggregates than conventional mixtures. SMA mixtures usually require a significant compactive effort; however, they also produce a pavement layer with a higher density compared to conventional mixtures. Generally speaking, it is not good to place any type of hot mix in cool or cold weather. SMA mixtures can be particularly difficult to place in cool weather because they are placed in thin lifts and they contain a high amount of polymer modified binder. They also do not lend themselves well to applications that require a significant amount of hand work.|$|E

5000|$|Typical use: SMA {{mixtures}} {{are typically}} {{used as a}} surface mix or intermediate layer in the pavement structure on high volume (or high demand) roadways. SMA mixtures are often used as the intermediate layer when PFC mix is used as the surface layer. The standard SMA mixture contains PG 76-22 and fibers and is recommended {{for the vast majority}} applications where SMA is used. Asphalt Rubber (A-R) SMA can be used as an alternate to the standard SMA. A-R SMA is generally more expensive than the standard SMA; however, its unique properties warrant its use in certain applications. As a general rule A-R SMA is recommend over the standard SMA when placed as an overlay on an existing concrete pavement, when a high degree of noise reduction is desired and when placed as an overlay on a pavement that has a high amount of cracking. [...] Advantages: SMA mixtures provide both excellent rut resistance and crack resistance. SMA mixtures have a high concentration of coarse aggregate, which facilitates stone on stone contact. The voids in the coarse aggregate skeleton are filled with fibers, <b>mineral</b> <b>filler,</b> and a relatively high amount (6% minimum) of polymer modified asphalt. This combination of materials allows for a “rich” mixture that is resistant to cracking {{while at the same time}} being highly resistant to rutting. SMA mixtures are considered to be impermeable particularly when compared to performance design mixtures. SMA mixtures result in a pavement layer that has a high degree of surface texture which is beneficial in terms of wet weather traction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} highway {{pavement}} {{is to provide}} smooth surface over which vehicles can move safely {{from one place to}} another. The two major types of pavement (flexible and rigid) have been mostly selected for the highway pavement to fulfil this function and they must be capable of transferring the wheel load to the subgrade such that its bearing capacity is not exceeded. However, the flexible pavements normally show defects like rutting, fatigue failure, low skid resistance and so on, causing the pavement to fail before its design life. Therefore, it is important to modify the asphalt concrete to make it more resistant to rutting and fatigue failure. Lime-modified asphalt has been observed to have better resistance to rutting, cracking and stripping, as well as having improved aging behavior. Therefore, this study looks at the Marshall properties of hydrated lime-modified asphalt mixture and the conventional asphalt. The conventional asphalt mixture was made using 10 % <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> while for the lime-modified asphalt, the <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> was replaced with hydrated lime. The bitumen with penetration grade 60 / 70 was used and the content varied from 5. 0 to 7. 5 %. Marshall stability and flow tests were carried out on the samples. The results show that the Marshall stability for the asphalt concrete with <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> ranges from 5. 89 – 7. 90 kN while that with hydrated lime ranges from 5. 9 to 8. 2 kN. The flow values for the asphalt concrete with <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> range from 2. 3 mm – 3. 3 mm, while that with hydrated lime range from 2. 4 – 3. 4 mm. The optimum bitumen content for both mixtures was found to be 6. 5 %. The stability and flow for the mixture with <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> were 7. 9 kN and 3. 3 mm, respectively, while for the mixtures with hydrated lime they were 8. 2 kN and 3. 4 mm, respectively. This indicates the replacement of the <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> with lime improves the stability of the mixtures, while there was slight increase in the flow of the mixture with hydrated lime. The slight increase in stability and flow values may be attributed to the complete replacement of the <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> with lime and the high lime content used in the study. More studies are being carried out to evaluate the Marshall properties for mixture with the <b>mineral</b> <b>filler</b> partially replaced with lime and for varying proportions of the lime content in the asphalt mixture...|$|E
