40|$|For the {{optimization}} {{and development}} of medical ultrasound transducers and imaging modalities, the Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method has been developed. This numerical method predicts the nonlinear acoustic pressure field, generated by a pulsed, plane source with an arbitrary aperture, and propagating in a three-dimensional tissue-like medium that extends over a very large domain of interest. The INCS method obtains the acoustic pressure from the nonlinear acoustic wave equation by treating the nonlinear term as a contrast source. The full nonlinear wave field is then found by iteratively solving the linearized wave problem using a Green's function method. By employing the Filtered Convolution method discussed in a companion paper, accurate field predictions are obtained at a discretization approaching two points per wavelength or period of the highest frequency of interest. In this paper, very large-scale, nonlinear field profiles are presented for transducers <b>with</b> <b>cylindrical</b> as <b>well</b> as phased array geometries, excited with a pulsed waveform having a center frequency of 1 - 2 MHz.

Polymer membranes {{have been studied}} for several decades, and conventional utility of these membranes has been realized {{over a wide range}} of applications such as water purification, gas separation, and fuel cells. Separation performance of polymer membranes for these applications can be evaluated from different aspects including selectivity, material cost, and thermal and mechanical stabilities. This research focused on the design of crosslinked polymer membranes from reactive block copolymers, which could possess some attractive features such as controlled functionality and morphology. Novel block copolymers containing a chemically crosslinkable block and a chemically modifiable block were of particular interest. Metathesis reactions were employed to crosslink these copolymers with additional tough polymers such as polycyclooctene (PCOE) and polydicyclopentadiene (polyDCPD), to realize enhanced toughness in the resulting materials. First, a norbornene-functionalized polystyrene-polylactide (PNS-PLA) block copolymer was synthesized. A self-assembled blend containing this copolymer and DCPD was cured by metathesis reactions, and nanoporous <b>monoliths</b> <b>with</b> a <b>cylindrical</b> morphology were successfully produced after removing the PLA component. These monoliths exhibited pronounced mechanical and thermal stabilities superior to nanoporous polystyrene (PS). Second, polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS) during the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of DCPD {{in the presence of the}} PNS-PLA copolymer rendered continuous PLA nanodomains in a crosslinked PNS/polyDCPD matrix. Upon etching the PLA component, the resultant nanoporous membranes exhibited well-defined percolated nanopores and good thermal and mechanical stabilities. Preliminary diffusion measurements demonstrated potential utility of such membranes in ultrafiltration. Third, crosslinked polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) were fabricated from a PNS-poly(n-propyl-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSSP) block polymer and COE/DCPD via the PIPS scheme followed by deprotection of the PSSP block. These PEMs possessed a bicontinuous morphology and mechanical and thermal robustness. Select PEMs exhibited high proton conductivity similar to Nafion at high humidity and reduced methanol crossover. Tunable domain size and mechanical strength of the resulting PEMs are advantageous attributes of this preparation protocol. Additionally, the use of such PEMs for NH 3 separation from gas mixtures was demonstrated. The appendix chapter represented our efforts to produce amine-functionalized polymer membranes from PNS-poly(dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) (PNS-PDMAEMA) and COE by metathesis reactions, potentially useful for CO 2 separation from gas mixtures...|$|R

40|$|Mesoporous {{films and}} <b>monoliths</b> <b>with</b> {{different}} thicknesses have been synthesized through evaporation-induced self-assembly {{in the presence}} of nonionic block copolymer templates. At the same reactant molar ratio, mesoporous thin films (similar to 300 - 500 nm in thickness) dip-coated on glass substrates have two-dimensional(2 D) hexagonal mesostructures (p 6 m), while monoliths (similar to 1 mm in thickness) formed in containers have centered rectangular structures (cmm). The different evaporation time in the two cases leads to different condensation extent of the silica species and finally induces different mesostructures. Water also {{plays an important role in}} the evaporation process and the range of water ratio in starting components where <b>monoliths</b> <b>with</b> centered rectangular structures are favored has been studied. As-synthesized <b>monoliths</b> <b>with</b> cmm structure show a certain degree of thermal stability during calcination, but are not stable during hydrothermal treatment and undergo a structure evolution to p 6 m; however, the calcined <b>monoliths</b> <b>with</b> cmm structure are hydrothermally stable, possibly due to its thick silica walls.

40|$|International audienceThis {{article is}} the logical {{continuation}} of a previous article (O. Coussy and T. Bourbié, 1984) concerning the propagation, {{within the framework of}} Biot's theory, of acoustic waves in infinite saturated porous media. Starting from the same assumptions as O. Coussy and T. Bourbié concerning the propagation media, this article analyzes the influence of the presence of plane geometric discontinuities (free semi-infinite media or the contacts between two semi-infinite media) or discontinuities <b>with</b> <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry (<b>wells).</b> After reviewing the stress-strain relations for a porous medium and the basic equations for dynamic poroelasticity, the article discusses the boundary conditions to be imposed on the interfaces. It then examines the general laws of reflection and refraction in poroelasticity (generalized Snell-Descartes laws). The application of these laws to several interesting specific cases mainly reveals the following phenomena: (1) a slow compressive wave is always generated at the interface between two saturated porous media; (2) the reflected and transmitted waves are generally inhomogeneous. In the next phase the propagation of acoustic waves is examined on the free surface of a semi-infinite saturated porous medium (Rayleigh waves) and at the plane interface between a liquid and a saturated porous medium (Stoneley waves). Compared to the properties known for them in conventional elastodynamics, these waves in poroelasticity are slightly dispersive, and appreciably attenuated because of the two-phase nature of the propagation medium. Lastly, the influence of a submerged source emitting near a permeable interface is examined. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental role of permeability and flow conditions at interfaces on the attenuation of S waves and surface waves. By way of comparison, the influence of these parameters on the first arrivals (P waves) is negligible. Likewise, it is shown that the geometry of the propagation medium plays a relatively secondary role. © IFP 198...|$|R

By {{variation of the}} molar ratio of the comonomers TMOS and functional silane, mesoporous silica objects containing different amounts of vinyl, allyl, and thiol groups were obtained.

Moreover, the different reactivity of the vinyl and allyl groups on the pore wall affects the addition reaction, and hence, the degree of the pore-wall functionalization.

In view of this, tapered nanoholes would be of importance for envisaged better light in coupling due to graded index effect and also {{from the point of}} fabrication feasibility. Using a 3 D finite element method based computational simulator, we investigate the basis structural influence of triangular as well as honeycomb lattice structured experimentally feasible tapered air nanoholes in 400 nm thick c Si absorber on a glass substrate. We present a detailed convergence analysis of volume absorption in Si absorber <b>with</b> <b>cylindrical</b> as <b>well</b> as tapered nanoholes. For a wavelength rage of 300 nm to 1100 nm, we present the computed results on light absorption of the engineered Si nanoholes for a lattice periodicity of 600 nm. In particular, we study the influence of tapering angle of engineered nano air holes in Si thin film for the absorption enhancement in photonic triangular and honeycomb lattice structured tapered nanoholes. Further we make a comparative analysis of cylindrical and tapered nanoholes for a range of light incident angles from 0 to 60. For the presented triangular as well as honeycomb lattice structured nanoholes, we observe that in comparison to the cylindrical nanoholes, the tapered nanoholes perform better in terms of light trapping for enhanced light absorption in textured Si thin films even when the effective volume fraction of Si is lower in the absorber layer with tapered nanoholes in comparison to that of cylindrical ones. From the maximum achievable short circuit current density estimation in the present study, the performance of c Si absorbing layer engineered with triangular lattice structured tapered air holes harvests light efficiently owing to its higher lattice symmetry among periodic structures as well as graded index effect of the tapered nanoholes. 2014 COPYRIGHT Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers SPIE.
