5|$|Plant <b>medicines</b> {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by {{side-effects}} of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription.

Further, the high standards applied to conventional <b>medicines</b> do not always apply to plant <b>medicines,</b> and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
