40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the extent of compliance with the International Education Standards (IES) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia plans to transition to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) over the next five years. For this to be successful in all respects (that is, adoption, implementation, monitoring and sanctioning), it is necessary for the country to have professional accountants educated, at the very minimum, in terms of the IES as issued by the International Federation of Accountants. The research method is archival using <b>mainly</b> secondary <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> together with some unstructured interviews. The study found that Saudi Arabia does not follow the IES in their entirety. Gaps were found with respect to professional skills, ethics and values as well as in the training phase. The country is aware of the need to converge with international standards and has set out an action plan to achieve this. However, all stakeholders need to be involved in the action plan in order for convergence to be successful...|$|R

In this study, we propose that consumers of art house movies are being led by film reviews when making a film choice (influence effect), whereas consumers of mainstream movies are hypothesized to rely <b>mainly</b> on other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Thus, in the latter case the review does not influence the moviegoer, but may still be a reflection of the ultimate success of the movie (predictor effect). Using the Dutch film industry as our empirical setting, we study the effects of reviews on the opening weekend and on the cumulative box office revenue. Our research shows that the number and size of film reviews in Dutch newspapers directly influence the behavior of the art-movie-going public in their film choice. The number and size of film reviews of mainstream movies, on the other hand, only predict movie performance.

40|$|The tiny Himalayan {{state of}} Sikkim {{is well known}} for its multi-cultural and {{multi-ethnic}} identity. There is a political and historical debate regarding the identity of communities in Sikkim. Lepchas are considered as original inhabitants of Sikkim. Currently, Lepcha, Bhutia and Limbu are recognised as minor communities and have Schedule Tribes (ST) status in the state. Individual community concentration is mainly found in North and West Sikkim. Lepcha-Bhutias are found mainly in North Sikkim whereas Limbus are concentrated in West Sikkim. Community concentration is profound in rural areas. Gyalshing sub-division of West Sikkim has been selected for the present study. Purpose {{of this study is to}} investigate the Gram Panchayat Unit (GPU) level economy and social development of the rural areas based <b>mainly</b> on secondary <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> A field survey was also conducted to interact with the local people. Findings suggest that education and population density are the key determinants for GPU level disparity in social development of the study area.

40|$|In a {{more and}} more diverse service related {{economical}} environment the client is ambushed by lots <b>of</b> <b>information</b> regarding that particular area. The customer’s attitude towards either {{a certain type of}} service or the other comes <b>mainly</b> from inexact <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> detained before having had a direct contact with the company at hand. Most of the time this information is absorbed via friends, commercials and it is subjective. Nevertheless, this initial type <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is not static at all. It has the tendency of working its way up towards modifying the company’s attitude towards customers. A great role in this molding process has the assistance personnel. Those people are the lesion between the company and the client, transforming the customer’s needs into potential services. In certain cases these service people can help bend certain company’s offers around certain customers. This article aims at underlying the role of these particular service people, as an interface between the client and the company. The main objective of these paper is finding the appropriate staff contact characteristics for different types of services.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this bachelor’s thesis was to {{research}} the connections between the surrounding environment and the information needs and the opportunities to satisfy them. It was done by way of example of young people of three different generations. By the surrounding environment the societal and political situation {{on the one hand}} and the narrower living environement and lifestyle (from place of habitation to activities) on the other hand was taken into account. The goals of this study were to find out the main <b>information</b> needs <b>of</b> young people of three generations and the factors influencing these needs, the main information sources and the factors influencing their choice, the role <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> <b>sources</b> as socialisers (<b>mainly</b> as <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information)</b> and the structure of the young people’s information fields. The most important theoretical sources for this study were the work and theories of J. G. Blumler and E. Katz, M. Lauristin and P. Vihalemm, D. McQuail and K. E. Rosengren. The work about the uses of mass communication edited by Blumler and Katz was an important starting point in the discussion <b>of</b> <b>information</b> needs and the needs satisfied by the media. The theory of mass communication by Lauristin and Vihalemm beared considerably on the topics <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and <b>information</b> <b>sources,</b> media and socialisation, in addition, the theory <b>of</b> <b>information</b> field origins from these authors. McQuail’s theory of mass communication offered theoretical discussions and explanations of concepts primarily on the topics <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and <b>information</b> <b>sources,</b> lifestyle and socialisation. The theories of Rosengren were more or less the base for most of the subject fields (information needs, lifestyle, socialisation, media as a socialiser etc.). The empirical material of this study was constituted by essays written by students of Tartu University and semistructured interviews with students of Tartu University and their family members. The analysis of the empirical material was carried out using a method similar to grounded theory. The main advantage of the method was its flexibility. The results of this study are difficult to bring forth briefly, as they comprised of several questions on the occasion of every generation, but comparing the three generations, it is possible to claim that the young people’s information needs have been growing and diversifying through the years, being clearly related to the society. But irrespective of the society, the most important information for young people has always been information related to their personal life. In addition it can be said that the society has always had more influence on young people’s information needs and the opportunities to satisfy them than the narrower living environment and lifestyle. The amount <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>sources</b> has grown in time and the role <b>of</b> some <b>sources</b> has changed, but some other information sources have retained their roles through the generations. Quite clear changes have taken place in the structure <b>of</b> young people’s <b>information</b> fields. The proportion <b>of</b> fundamental <b>information</b> has decreased in time and the proportion <b>of</b> operative <b>information</b> has increased. The picture of knowledge, values and norms is more diversified. Dealing with a similar branch of study in the future, one could pose one central research question to seize a smaller part of the subject-matter. This enables to delve into one question more thoroughly and to achieve more interesting results. Comparing three different generations set remarkable limits to the empirical data. In being restricted to researching the present, it would be possible to research the topic more thoroughly and diversely. In connection with the topic <b>of</b> <b>information</b> needs one <b>of</b> the potential research topics could be media (or some other <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information)</b> as a <b>source</b> for satisfying information needs...|$|R

One study on long term RP showed that risk assessment after receiving risk-related information was in part mediated by heuristic and systematic information processing. Here, highly credible sources were associated with more heuristic information processing and lower perceived risk. In turn, low credibility <b>of</b> an <b>information</b> <b>source</b> is associated with more systematic information processing and higher perceived risk. If the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was an industry or government organization, higher credibility was correlated with lower perceived risk scores in this study.
