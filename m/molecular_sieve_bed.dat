40|$|AbstractWater vapor in {{a natural}} gas stream can result in line {{plugging}} due to hydrate formation, reduction of line capacity due to collection of free water in the line, and increased risk of damage to the pipeline due to the corrosive effects of water. Therefore, water vapor must be removed from natural gas to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion from condensed water. Gas dehydration {{is the process of}} removing water vapor from a gas stream to lower the temperature at which water will condense from the stream; this temperature is called the “dew point” of the gas. Molecular sieves are considered {{as one of the most}} important materials that are used as desiccant materials in industrial natural gas dehydration. This work shows a study of natural gas dehydration using 3 A molecular sieve as a type of solid desiccant materials, the scope of this work was to build up a pilot scale unit for a natural gas dehydration as simulation of actual existing plant for Egyptian Western Desert Gas Company (WDGC). The effect of different operating conditions (water vapor concentration and gas flow rate) on dehydration of natural gas was studied. The experimental setup consists of cylinder filled with 3 A molecular sieve to form a fixed bed, then pass through this bed natural gas with different water vapor concentration, The experimental setup is fitted with facilities to control bed pressure, flow rate, measure water vapor concentration and bed temperature, a gas heater was used to activate <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>bed.</b> Increasing water vapor concentration in inlet feed gas leads to a marked decrease in dehydration efficiency.

40|$|Tritium and {{deuterium}} {{are expected}} to be the fuel for the first fusion power reactors. Being radioactive, tritium is a health, safety and environment concern. Room air tritium clean systems can be used to handle tritium that has been lost to the room from primary or secondary containment. Such a system called the Experimental Tritium Cleanup (ETC) systems is installed at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The ETC consists of (1) two compressors which draw air from the room, (2) a catalyst bed for conversion of tritium to tritiated water, and (3) <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> for collection of the water. The exhaust from this system can be returned to the room or vented to the stack. As part of the US/Japan fusion collaboration, on two separate occasions, tritium was released into the 3000 m 3 TSTA test cell, and the ETC was used to handle these releases. Each release consisted of about one Curie of tritium. Tritium concentrations in the room were monitored at numerous locations. Also recorded were the HT and HTO concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Tritium surface concentrations in the test cell were measured before and at a series of times after the releases. Surfaces included normal test cell equipment as well as idealized test specimens. The results showed that the tritium became well-mixed in the test cell after about 45 min. When the ETC was turned on, the tritium in the TSTA test cell decreased exponentially as was expected.

40|$|The TFTR tritium {{operations}} {{staff has}} successfully received, stored, handled, and processed over five hundred thousand curies of tritium {{for the purpose}} of supporting D-T (Deuterium-Tritium) operations at TFTR. Tritium operations personnel nominally provide continuous round the clock coverage (24 hours/day, 7 days/week) in shift complements consisting of I supervisor and 3 operators. Tritium Shift Supervisors and operators are required to have 5 years of operational experience in either the nuclear or chemical industry and to become certified for their positions. The certification program provides formal instruction, {{as well as on the}} job training. The certification process requires 4 to 6 months to complete, which includes an oral board lasting up to 4 hours at which time the candidate is tested on their knowledge of Tritium Technology and TFTR Tritium systems. Once an operator is certified, the training process continues with scheduled training weeks occurring once every 5 weeks. During D-T operations at TFTR the operators must evacuate the tritium area due to direct radiation from TFTR D-T pulses. During `` time operators maintain cognizance over tritium systems via a real time TV camera system. Operators are able to gain access to the Tritium area between TFTR D-T pulses, but have been excluded from die tritium area during D-T pulsing for periods up to 30 minutes. Tritium operators are responsible for delivering tritium gas to TFRR as well as processing plasma exhaust gases which lead to the deposition of tritium oxide on disposable <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> (DMSB).

40|$|In the summer/fall of 1996 {{after nearly}} three years of D-T operations, TFTR {{underwent}} an extended outage during which large port covers {{were removed from the}} vacuum vessel in order to complete upgrades to the tokamak. Following the venting of the torus, a three tier system was developed for the outage in order to reduce and control the free tritium in the vacuum vessel so as to minimize the exposure to personnel during port cover removal and reinstallation. The first phase of the program to reduce the free tritium consisted of direct flowthrough of room air through the vacuum vessel to the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> using the Torus Cleanup System. Real time measurements of the effluent tritium concentration were used to derive the amount of tritium removed from the torus. Once the free tritium in the vessel had been reduced to approximately 50 Ci, a second phase was initiated using a 55 Gallon Drum Bubbler System for the direct processing of the vacuum vessel to further lower the tritium level in the torus. Tritium oxide is absorbed by the bubbler system with the exhaust vented to one of the tritium monitored HVAC ventilation stacks. To preclude the release of tritium to the Test Cell location of TFTR and to minimize the exposure of workers, a variable flow exhaust system was employed in order to maintain a negative pressure in the vacuum vessel between 0. 05 " and 1. 5 " w. c. during the removal of port covers ranging in size from approximately 5 to 1000 in(superscript 2). These systems were completely successful in reducing and controlling the free tritium in TFTR and were instrumental in maintaining ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) exposures to tritium during the 1996 outage. These systems are again being utilized during the safe shutdown and decommissioning of TFTR which commenced in April of 1997. This paper describes in detail the configuration of these systems and the data obtained during the outage and safe shutdown of TFTR...|$|R

This method ignores real-time bed fill level knowledge, which could potentially lead to an overflow. A MATLAB code was written to compute the amount tritiated water accumulated in the beds.

They can produce as much as 1. 2 E 6 SCFH 02 and 4. 5 SCFH N 2 (not coincidently) with a peak product efficiency of 85 - 86 % (product to total Intake). The general area demand has been as high as 10 E 6, as low as 4. 5 E 6, and is currently 8 E 6 SCFH totaI product. The plant is really four plants in one. At anyone time one or more plants can be down for maintenance and the others online and delivering to the pipe line that distributes their product to nearby steel plants, and to the liquid reservoirs (perlite insulated tanks) of 160, 160 and 200 E 6 SCF. At {{the time of our}} visit two plants were down and two were on line. The following describes the characteristics of one of the four plants. The cycle requires a base compressor (Brown Boveri, 22, 600 hp) that pumps to 90 - 100 psig, and a booster compressor (Clark, 14, 000 hp) that pumps to 300 psig. Filter houses (ca. 20 -ft x 20 -ft) feed the suctions and the discharge is scrubbed by dual, <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve,</b> <b>beds</b> 0 300 psi (6 - 8 hour cycle time). The beds are provided with dust blow down and down stream filter provisions. The scrubbers remove CO 2, the heavy HC, and water. The effectiveness of the scrubbers is measured by the record 6 years one of the plants ran w/o the need for thawing. The thaw operation takes about 4 days. It was interesting to learn that a plant can be brought on line in two and one half hours from a warm start. Major swings from N 2 rich to O 2 rich production take about an hour. Argon is a small constituent in air (0. 61) and thus not a major product. It comes off the main column at 761 Ar balance air components and is further purified in another column to 2 % N 2, 2 % O 2. The stream is then warmed, H 2 added, and run though a palladium deoxo to combine the O 2 to water. The water is removed in a dryer and the product reliquified to seperate the nitrogen. The final product is either drawn off and pumped to storage, or, in the case of case of the high purity product, pressure transfered directly from the final column to a properly cooled and purged truck backed right up to the column. The high purity product can be as low as 0. 3 ppm 02 by proper application of these procedures. Liquid Argon is the only product for which standing, loaded, trailers are provided vent recovery lines.

This work mainly presents the progress {{in the development of}} heteroatom-containing aluminophosphate <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> with new zeolite structures and variable framework compositions in recent years...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production methods and the prospective uses of carbon <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> The main route to these materials is replication synthesis, where a silica or aluminosilicate <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> {{is used as}} template to grow the carbonaceous phase in the voids. These materials may have applications as varied as in separation, adsorption and storage of gases, as electrodes in batteries, and as catalyst supports, all of them highly dependent on the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> porosity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate effect of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> on the esterification reaction between lauric acid and geraniol in isooctane catalyzed by immobilized lipase in a batch and continuous-loop packed-bed reactor. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> {{were used to}} reduce the inhibitive effect of water formed during the reaction by removing it as it formed. Results in a batch reactor showed that, for the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> to have a pronounced effect {{on the performance of}} the enzyme, a ratio of at least 2 : 1 with respect to the weight of the immobilized enzyme must be used. It was also found that the ability of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> to reduce inhibition by water is more noticeable when working in a packed-bed reactor. The physical contact between the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> and enzymes is of utmost importance for the adsorption of water since water is markedly insoluble in the organic solvent...|$|R
40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>sieves,</b> porous, {{crystalline}} frameworks with pore {{sizes of}} molecular dimensions, are of great industrial importance as detergents, catalysts and absorbants. Despite their technological importance, the syntheses {{of these materials}} are still not well understood and typically rely on extensive series of trials to produce new framework structures. Thermodynamic investigations are undertaken {{to better understand the}} energetic differences amongst <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> frameworks and the mechanisms and interactions important in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> self-assembly. The enthalpies relative to quartz at 298. 15 K are determined by high-temperature solution calorimetry for a collection of calcined pure-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> with diverse structural features. Si 0 _ 2 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> are shown to be only modestly (6. 8 - 14. 4 kJ/mol) metastable with respect to quartz. A strong linear correlation between enthalpy and molar volume is observed, implying that the overall packing quality determines the relative enthalpies of Si 0 _ 2 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> Silanol (Si-O-H) defect sites lead to an additional destabilization of no more than 2. 4 kJ/mol. The entropies of four pure-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> spanning the entire range of molar volumes available to Si 0 _ 2 frameworks are determined by the integration of heat capacity measurements from 5 to 400 K. The entropies of these structures are almost identical (3. 2 - 4. 2 J∙K^(- 1) ∙mol^(- 1) above quartz), hence the empty pore volume and cages do not contribute appreciably to the vibrational density of states. The enthalpy and entropy data are combined to calculate the Gibbs free energies of transition from quartz to eight other silica polymorphs, including four <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> as well as silica glass. At typical synthesis conditions, the available thermal energy is RT = 3. 5 kJ/mol. The <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> Gibbs free energies are only slightly larger than RT at 5. 5 - 12. 6 kJ/mol above quartz and lie in the same energetic region as the amorphous precursors used for <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> preparation. There are therefore no significant thermodynamic barriers to transformations among silica polymorphs. Thus the role of SDA in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> syntheses is not the stabilization of otherwise very unstable phases. Interaction enthalpies between inorganic frameworks and organic SDAs are measured by HF solution calorimetry for six molecular sieve/SDA pairs. The enthalpies are only moderately exothermic (- 1. 1 to - 5. 9 kJ/mol SiO_ 2), as expected if the predominant interactions are van der Waals contacts between the hydrophobic silica frameworks and the hydrocarbon portions of the SDAs. Interaction entropies can be estimated for three framework/SDA pairs, and, when used in combination with the interaction enthalpies, allow the calculation of the Gibbs free energies of interaction between these three inorganic/organic pairs. The latter values range from - 2. 0 to - 5. 4 kJ/mol SiO_ 2, smaller in magnitude than twice the available thermal energy at <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis temperatures. This energy range is comparable to the range observed for the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> frameworks alone, showing that energetics of both the frameworks and of the molecular sieve/SDA interactions must be considered in order to adequately describe <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis. The energetics of the synthesis of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> (considering all components present in the synthesis mixture) are examined here and also reveal small differences between various molecular sieve/SDA combinations. The energetic contribution of the effective dilution experienced by the SDA upon occlusion is similar in magnitude to the other energetic effects. The strong selectivity of organic SDAs experimentally observed {{in the face of the}} comparatively small energetic differences suggests that kinetic factors dominate in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> preparation. ...|$|R
