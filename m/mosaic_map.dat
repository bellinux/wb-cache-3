5|$|Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius (518–520) in his De situ terrae sanctae {{mentions}} that 'close to Jacob's Well are {{the remains of}} Joseph the Holy'. The Madaba <b>Mosaic</b> <b>Map</b> (6th century) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – 'Joseph's' (τὸ τοῦ Ὶωσήφ) – where the usual adjective 'holy' (hagios) accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Depicted in the <b>mosaic</b> <b>Map</b> of Madaba of 600, Gaza was {{the most}} {{important}} political and commercial center on the southern coast of Palestine. Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach Raphia. The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} scalable multi-view video coding {{with a novel}} algorithm to estimate panoramic <b>mosaic</b> depth <b>maps.</b> Multiple view-dependent depth maps are generated by applying a forward depth projection to decoded panoramic <b>mosaic</b> depth <b>maps</b> in the proposed codec. By us-ing the generated depth maps, the proposed scheme not only improves view synthesis prediction performances, but also achieves free-viewpoint scalability and coarse granular SNR scalability. These functionalities {{will be important to}} sup-port any kinds of 3 D display by a single bitstream and to realize free-viewpoint television. Experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves about 7. 4 % bitrate reduction rel-ative to the most popular multi-view video coding method and also achieves almost the same efficiency as the conven-tional scheme which supports neither free-viewpoint scala-bility nor SNR scalability. Compared to one of the simplest free-viewpoint scalable multi-view coding, up to 16. 8 % bi-trate reduction is achieved by the proposed method. 1...|$|R

Although only a coarse spectral resolution of around 7 km s- 1 was available to us, we detect widespread, extended emission in the CS (1 – 0) ground state transition. We also detect eight Class I CH 3 OH masers at 44 GHz and three SiO masers in vibrationally excited (1 – 0) transitions. We also detect the H 53 a radio recombination line, non-vibrationally excited SiO (1 – 0) and emission in the CH 3 OH 11 – 00 A+ line...|$|R
