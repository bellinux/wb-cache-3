5|$|In 1929, Princeton Theological Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the wider church rather than just Old School Presbyterianism. Two of the seminary's new board members were signatories to the Auburn Affirmation. In order to preserve Princeton's Old School legacy, Machen {{and several of his}} colleagues founded Westminster Theological Seminary.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E

5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose of}} comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of its massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|The Seay House, another 18th-century home, is a <b>more</b> typical <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> {{a pioneer}} home. Its single stone {{fireplace}} and simple construction were common traits of farmsteads from this period.|$|R
30|$|Depending {{on their}} own {{political}} views, the newspapers give more or less room to different coalitions. This shows that news media are not neutral for discourses and {{should be seen as}} actors, too. For example, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung cites <b>more</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> gas and oil companies while the comments on hydraulic fracturing written by journalists of Süddeutsche Zeitung or TAZ clearly show a more skeptical attitude towards “fracking”. However, actors of all coalitions are cited in all analyzed newspapers.|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{overturn}} the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, {{at a time of}} increasing civil rights activism. The PR/STV system had enabled minorities to enter local politics and gain seats on the city council more than they had before, in proportion to their share of the population. This made the government <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the residents of the city.|$|E
25|$|Hopper's solitary {{figures are}} mostly women—dressed, semi-clad, and nude—often reading or looking out a window, {{or in the}} workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images Girl at Sewing Machine (1921), New York Interior (another woman sewing) (1921), and Moonlight Interior (a nude getting into bed) (1923). Automat (1927) and Hotel Room (1931), however, are <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> his mature style, {{emphasizing}} the solitude more overtly.|$|E

25|$|Aircraft Compatibility Testing (ACT) Phase 1 {{concluded}} in late 2011 following 134 launches (aircraft types comprising the F/A-18E Super Hornet, T-45C Goshawk, C-2A Greyhound, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, and F-35C Lightning II) using the EMALS demonstrator installed at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst.

25|$|Secondly, he {{constructed}} a narrative from Creation to his present, again similar to Herodotus or the Hebrew Bible. Within this construction, the sacred myths blended with history. Whether he shared Hellenistic {{skepticism about the}} existence of the gods and their tales is unknown, though it is likely he believed them more than the satirist Ovid, for example. The naturalistic attitude found in Syncellus' transmission is probably <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the later Greek authors who transmitted the work than of Berossus himself.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was thus}} extensively modified, receiving new Salmson water-cooled aero-engines {{instead of the}} Hispano Suiza engines, along with other changes, such as the adoption of an alternative exhaust stack configuration, a 3-degree dihedral on the mainplanes, and a tail unit <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> production aircraft. Following these modifications, the prototype was used for several years, surviving the war and being allocated a civil registration. In August 1919, the prototype was flown from Brooklands to Amsterdam, the Netherlands as part of Vicker's exhibit at the Eerste Luchtverkeer Tentoonstelling Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> {{the genus}} {{are present in}} Asia. At least nine species have been {{recorded}} from mainland India, some of which also overlap C.cinnabarinums range in Indonesia, Taiwan, or Japan. Many of these species can be readily distinguished by macroscopic features. C.japonicum is pinkish orange and lacks a gelatinous outer layer, while both C.jiangii and C.junghuhnii are brown. However, others require microscopic features of spore shape and ornamentation for identification. Unlike the uniformly elongated spores of C.cinnabarinum, C.guizhouense possesses both elliptical and globose spores. C.pengii differs primarily {{in the pattern of}} ornamentation on its spore surface.|$|R
25|$|As part of {{settlement}} of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted {{a system of}} cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has {{increased the number of}} African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> their citizens.|$|E
25|$|He {{is a man}} magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, {{almost a}} Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with {{classical}} myths less original than Caeiro, but <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, {{the sense of being}} an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.|$|E
25|$|Roy Park {{has noted}} in {{particular}} Hazlitt's critique of excessive abstraction {{as a major}} flaw in the period’s dominant philosophy and poetry. ("Abstraction", in this case, could be that of religion or mysticism as well as science.) This is the reason, according to Hazlitt, why neither Coleridge, nor Wordsworth, nor Byron could write effective drama. <b>More</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the finer spirit of the age was poetry that turned inward, focusing on individual perceptions, projections of the poets' sensibilities. The greatest {{of this type of}} poetry was Wordsworth's, and that succeeded as far as any contemporary writing could.|$|E
50|$|International {{associations}} {{of local and}} regional authorities which have a consultative status with the Council of Europe also have observer status with the Congress. Observer status may also be granted to other associations on application to the Bureau of the Congress..

25|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more socially open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> society as a whole. Humbler students were aided by a system of bursaries established for the training of the clergy. In this period residence became divorced from the colleges and {{students were able to}} live much more cheaply and largely unsupervised, at home, with friends or in lodgings in the university towns. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|The first prototype, a {{proof-of-concept}} aircraft, {{using the}} metal wings from a Dornier Do 28 and with large struts bracing the wing to the sponsons, conducted its maiden flight from Hamburg on 17 August 1984. A second prototype, which was <b>more</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the definitive design, featured several alterations; these included {{the adoption of}} a new composite wing, which connected with a set of cabane struts to the fuselage only, and was a larger aircraft overall. On 24 April 1987, the second prototype made its first flight from Oberpfaffenhofen. Development work on the project came to a close in 1991. A total of three aircraft had been produced at this point. In 1990, a European certificate of airworthiness was received for the type; in 1991, American airworthiness was also granted to the Seastar.|$|E

The qualifying result remained the best the team would ever achieve. The experiment of basing the team in Brazil did not last - it was too far from their engine and gearbox suppliers and did not have the large community of expert component manufacturers available in the UK. Although the first FD04 was built there, future cars would be built at the team's established base in Reading, UK, in what would become known as 'motorsport valley'.|$|E
