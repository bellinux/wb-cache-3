5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of the {{commissions}} or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression.</b> Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} that the parental-specific <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> mammalian imprinted genes might be dependent on maternal-paternal intergenomic or interallelic interactions. Using quantitative allele-specific RT-PCR single nucleotide primer extension assays developed for two imprinted genes, Snrpn and Igf 2 r, we demonstrate: (i) No role for maternal-paternal allelic interactions: the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> parental-specific <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Snrpn and Igf 2 r in normal ova were unchanged in gynogenetic and androgenetic ova; the latter contain two maternal and two paternal genomes respectively, and cannot undergo maternal-paternal interactions. (ii) No role for allelic counting or exclusion mechanisms: in individual blastomeres of androgenetic ova, both paternal Snrpn alleles were active (Snrpn was not expressed in gynogenetic ova), and in individual gynogenetic and androgenetic blastomeres, both maternal and paternal Igf 2 r alleles, respectively, were active. (iii) No role for ploidy: the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> parental-specific <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Snrpn and Igf 2 r in normal diploid ova was unchanged in individual blastomeres of triploid and tetraploid ova. Thus, the maternal and paternal genomes function independently in establishing the pre-implantation <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> parental-specific <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Snrpn and Igf 2 r, with no role for trans-allelic/genomic interaction phenomena.

2500|$|Originally {{published}} in the dissident journal Novy Mir, The Time: Night entered the scene {{on the border between}} mainstream and dissident literature just after the demise of the Soviet Union. Critics have acclaimed it as both Petrushevskaya's strongest work and the standard mold for her distinctive voice. [...] The Time: Night does typify Petrushevskaya's dark sense of humor and candid portrayal of gritty urban life in post-Soviet Moscow; [...] "unforgiving verbal authenticity" [...] is a defining quality of all Petrushevskaya's work. Petrushevskaya's narrative style being [...] "fueled by rumor, gossip, and polemic," [...] her work suffered harsh criticism during Perestroika, when cynicism began to lose its appeal among the literary elite. Similarly, the author's evenhanded portrayal of physiology in The Time: Night starkly contrasted traditional treatment of the issue in the early 1990s. Helen Goscilo frames Petrushevskaya's [...] "presumably unmotivated frankness" [...] concerning the body as a break from a [...] "feminine" [...] <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> particular to only a few modern Russian women writers. [...] Petrushevskaya's chef d'oeuvre has since earned a reputation as a pillar of New Women's Prose, a genre of [...] "bracing irreverence" [...] and [...] "complete lack of 'ladylike' squeamishness." [...] Notably, however, Petrushevskaya does not take a particularly militant feminist stance, given the groundbreaking implications of The Time: Night. When prompted by an editor (before the publication of the novella) as to whether she sided with men or women, Petrushevskaya responded with [...] "I'm {{on the side of the}} children.". Though her characters complain bitterly of Soviet and post-Soviet women's conditions, Petrushevskaya, nor New Women's Prose as a genre sprung from her work, minimizes [...] "women's collusion in their own victimization." [...] It might be concluded, then, that while Petrushevskaya introduced a blunt portrayal of contemporary Russian women's life in The Time: Night, her frankness is less a political tool than an empathetic gesture, though it took scholars years to identify that purpose.|$|E
2500|$|In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, (1992), {{the issue}} of banning hate speech arose again {{when a group of}} Caucasian {{teenagers}} burned a cross in the front yard of an African-American family. The local ordinance in St. Paul, Minnesota, criminalized such expressions considered racist and the teenager was charged thereunder. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Supreme Court, held that the prohibition against hate speech was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment. The Supreme Court struck down the ordinance. Scalia explicated the fighting words exception as follows: “The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey”. [...] Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression,</b> but with the content of expression, it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus, the Supreme Court embraced the idea that speech in general is permissible unless it will lead to imminent violence. The opinion noted [...] "This conduct, if proved, might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson, criminal damage to property", among a number of others, none of which was charged, including threats to any person, not to only protected classes.In 2011, the Supreme Court issued their ruling on Snyder v. Phelps, which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. The issue presented was whether the 1st Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs. In an 8–1 decision the court sided with Fred Phelps, the head of Westboro Baptist Church, thereby confirming their historically strong protection of freedom of speech, so long as it doesn't promote imminent violence. The Court explained, [...] "speech deals with matters of public concern when it can 'be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community' or when it 'is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public."In June 2017, the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision on Matal v. Tam that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violates the First Amendment's free speech clause. The issue was about government prohibiting the registration of trademarks that are [...] "racially disparaging". Justice Samuel Alito writes:Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express “the thought that we hate.” United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).Justice Anthony Kennedy also writes:A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government’s benevolence. Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society.Effectively, the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirms that there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment.|$|E
