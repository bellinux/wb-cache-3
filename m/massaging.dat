5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively <b>massaging</b> them with a mucous secretion.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in {{meditation}} at this place, keeping {{away from}} Thuling, {{a place in}} the Himalayas which was corrupted by meat-eating monks and unchaste people. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him {{in the form of the}} Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi <b>massaging</b> his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.|$|E
5|$|Solimán: Solimán {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the text as the slave who receives the fortune of <b>massaging</b> the body of Pauline and also lavishing her beauty with great care. He begins to conduct voodoo rituals with Pauline {{for the sake of}} Leclerc, who has contracted yellow fever. Following the demise of Henri Christophe, Solimán ends up in Europe, where he enjoys the summers. He is given food and drink freely and his appearance is the subject of much attention. He regales exaggerated and embellished tales of his past and even makes an appearance at theatre performances. He later comes across a marble statue of Pauline and this, coupled with memories of the night that witnessed the demise of Henri Christophe, causes him to fall into madness, flee, and eventually succumb to malaria.|$|E

25|$|Very gently <b>massaging</b> {{the area}} and {{applying}} heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the gate control theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until {{at least three days}} following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into {{the area and}} encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: <b>Massage</b> {{training}} {{and how the}} body is influenced by <b>massage</b> are common issues which are seriously under study and discussion in Iranian traditional medicine. Iranian physicians considered motion and <b>massage</b> as major principles of health maintenance. In this study, we examined the available literature of traditional medicine to evaluate location, purpose and use of <b>massage</b> therapy in Iranian medicine in comparison with other popular conventional styles. The aim of Iranian <b>massage</b> is to regulate the core body temperature and aid to eliminate the waste products from the body. This type of <b>massage</b> is divided into five categories including solid, soft, moderate, great and aggressive, based on the intensity, speed, duration and techniques of <b>massage.</b> Iranian physicians proposed general body <b>massage</b> or <b>massage</b> of a particular area based on subjective complaints. They recommended specific <b>massages</b> in particular groups including children, pregnant women, the elderly and athletes. In some cases, {{the effects of these}} recommendations have been studied in clinical trials. Conclusion: It seems that the major difference between Iranian <b>massage</b> and other styles of <b>massage</b> is special attention of Iranian <b>massage</b> to the individual circumstances, and the cause of the problem rather than technique of the <b>massage...</b>|$|R

25|$|One may {{understand}} how the service given to one's guru can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched {{with the idea of}} intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee <b>massaging</b> the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in puja and innumerable other Vaishnava contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.|$|E
25|$|Milk is {{extracted}} from the cow's udder by flexible rubber sheaths known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid air chamber. A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum {{is applied to the}} inflation's air chamber during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow's teat, squeezing the milk out of teat in a similar fashion as a baby calf's mouth <b>massaging</b> the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{writes that}} this {{propaganda}} was effective, as {{it not only}} influenced attitudes in neutral countries at the time, but also reached the British House of Commons when Richard Stokes, a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), a long term opponent of area-bombing, quoted information from the German Press Agency (controlled by the Propaganda Ministry). It was Stokes' questions in the House of Commons that were in large part responsible for the shift in the UK against this type of raid. Taylor suggests that, although the destruction of Dresden would have affected people's support for the Allies regardless of German propaganda, {{at least some of}} the outrage did depend on Goebbels' <b>massaging</b> of the casualty figures.|$|E

5000|$|Although Thailand {{is known}} for Thai <b>massage,</b> its non-sexual, {{traditional}} style of <b>massage,</b> known as nuat phaen boran, some <b>massage</b> parlours provide customers erotic <b>massage</b> at additional cost including handjobs, oral sex, and sexual intercourse. The Federation of Thai Spa Associations (FTSPA) in 2016 urged authorities {{to clamp down on}} sexual services being offered at some <b>massage</b> parlours. The FTSPA maintains that influential figures have used legal loopholes to open [...] "pretty spas" [...] or <b>massage</b> parlours where tourists can buy sexual services.

25|$|After the 2005 series, {{complaints}} {{prompted the}} Australian Communications and Media Authority {{to launch an}} investigation into Big Brother: Uncut. The main complaint was that Network Ten had breached the industry code of practice by broadcasting footage that went past the maximum MA15+ rating for Australian commercial television. The ACMA found Network Ten had breached the code on two occasions: the airing of housemate Michael <b>massaging</b> Gianna with his penis exposed, and the song about sexual fetishes. The ACMA did not impose any direct punishment on Network Ten, however outlined requirements for the 2006 series of Uncut. Included in those requirements is a commitment by Network Ten to compile episode footage early enough for censors to evaluate it. Two censors were taken on by the network specifically for Big Brother, and crew were trained on the restrictions of the MA15+ television rating. As a result of criticism, the show was renamed Big Brother: Adults Only for the 2006 season.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{duties of}} the midwife in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes <b>massaging</b> her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E
500|$|Pugs, {{like other}} short-snouted breeds, have {{elongated}} palates. When excited, they {{are prone to}} [...] "reverse sneezing" [...] which causes them to quickly (and seemingly laboriously) gasp and snort. The veterinary name for this is pharyngeal gag reflex and it is caused by fluid or debris getting caught under the palate and irritating the throat or limiting breathing. Reverse sneezing episodes are usually not harmful, and <b>massaging</b> the dog's throat or covering its nose {{in order to make}} it breathe through its mouth can often shorten a sneezing fit.|$|E
