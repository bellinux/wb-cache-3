The <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man,</b> the harlot, and the pimp run all around town getting into {{all sorts of}} scenarios: scuffling over a seat on a park bench, falsely claiming to have been robbed, going to a dance, and gambling in a card game. They all end up at a party and are seen eating at a table all together. The <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> looks at his wedding ring, and inside of it he sees an image of his wife walking backwards away from him. He begins to miss her and his regular life.|$|R

25|$|Several <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> {{of means}} responded to Gunness' ads. One was John Moe, who arrived from Elbow Lake, Minnesota. He had brought more than $1,000 {{with him to}} pay off her mortgage, or so he told neighbors, to whom Gunness {{introduced}} him as her cousin. He disappeared from her farm {{within a week of}} his arrival. Next came George Anderson from Tarkio, Missouri, who, like Peter Gunness and John Moe, was an immigrant from Norway.|$|E
25|$|The {{most painful}} {{period in the}} camp's history began in October 1940. The Nazi Gauleiter ("governor") from the Baden region of Germany had also been named Gauleiter of the {{neighboring}} French region of Alsace. In Baden resided some 7,500 Jews; they were mainly women, children, and the elderly, given that the young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> had emigrated (official Nazi policy, overseen and made more efficient by Adolf Eichmann) or {{had gone to the}} Nazi concentration camps.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, younger Hong Kong workers began {{avoiding}} the manufacturing industry entirely. Hong Kong's on-going evolution away from manufacturing picked up steam during the decade, as production's {{share of the}} economy fell from 22.8% in 1980 to 16.7% ten years later. Replacing it was a greater reliance on services, which rose from 68.3% to 75.4% of GDP. The fastest growing sectors were foreign trade, logistics and communications and general personal and community services. The lack of investment in domestic industry, along with China's economic reform, began opening up manufacturing to the mainland. <b>Middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> and women who had spent decades in manufacturing were suddenly left {{with no place to}} go.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in Ordinary Men (1992), Christopher Browning {{examined}} the deeds of German Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the Ordnungspolizei ("order police"), used to commit massacres and round-ups of Jews, {{as well as}} mass deportations to the death camps. The members of the battalion were <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> of working-class background from Hamburg, who were too old for regular military duty. They were given no special training. During the murder of 1,500 Jews from Józefów, their commander allowed them {{to opt out of}} direct participation. Fewer than 12 men out of a battalion of 500 did so. Influenced by the Milgram experiment on obedience, Browning argued that the men killed out of peer pressure, not blood lust.|$|E
25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men.</b> However, the main philosophy seen across the story is the individualism, the stance which emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person's suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more about others than himself. This is because Subaru believes he can hurt others {{with the idea that}} he will never understand other people. The same problem comes from the fact Subaru and Hokuto are twins and as a result try to live in order to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual as his actions are deemed as arrogant by Seishiro for taking the guilt. Additionally, he starts taking actions that he believes are immoral despite his reasons for them such as lying to a mother about her daughter's wish to stop her from taking revenge.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} become a major {{commercial}} success, becoming the most highly rated original production in the Hub Network's broadcast history and leading to new merchandising opportunities for Hasbro, including books, clothing, collectible trading cards, and comics.

500|$|I Love Bees is {{credited}} with helping drive attention to Halo 2; former Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Dan Hsu stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "I Love Bees really got existing gamers and other consumers talking about the universe of [...]" [...] Billy Pidgeon, a game analyst, noted that I Love Bees achieved what it had been designed to do: [...] "This kind of viral guerrilla marketing worked... Everyone started instant messaging about it and checking out the site." [...] I Love Bees not only received coverage from gaming publications, but attracted mainstream press attention as well. At its height, ilovebees received between two and three million unique visitors over the course of three months. 9,000 people also actively participated in the real-world aspects of the game. The players of I Love Bees themselves were quite varied. The target demographic for the promotion was younger males, but one player noted that even <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> and women were engaged in the game.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} six days of the Kuttantavar festival, Aravan's head (cami) is [...] "danced" [...] around the streets of Kuvagam, with music and {{fireworks}} accompanying it. Each household offers a puja (a kind of devotional ceremony) to Aravan, with lamp-waving, coconut-offerings and other rituals. Traditionally, goats and chickens are sacrificed. On the 13thday, Aravan's [...] "soul" [...] is ritually transferred from his head to a pot, and the head is repainted. On {{the evening of the}} 14thday, a [...] high post is erected on a processional chariot. The post will support Aravan's head and body later in the festival. After the post-setting ceremony (kampam niruttatal), young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> (farmers and traders from Koovagam and surrounding villages) who have vowed to marry Aravan purchase thalis—the traditional mark of a married woman, in this case a pendant with a piece of turmeric at its centre. The priest, representing Aravan, ties the thalis around their necks in the inner sanctum of the temple. Even married men and men afflicted with diseases, all dressed as women, are described as ritually [...] "marrying" [...] Aravan in the festival, to please the deity.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they had an old script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out, with it eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors {{did not have much}} to do in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E
