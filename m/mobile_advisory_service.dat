40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> are {{characterized}} by location-dependent and spatial distributed information, unknown environments and limited tool support. These aspects complicate <b>mobile</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> {{to the point that}} the delivered service appears rather fuzzy than transparent. To tackle that problem, we examine the practical field of home security advice and present an initial design solution. The system called “SmartProtector” adapts existing knowhow from the stationary advisory context and complements it with findings from a field analysis. Evaluation shows that we have been successful in reaching our objective of increasing transparency in home security advisory situations leading to more comprehension on the clients’ side. In addition to the practical innovation, we contribute generic requirements to the discussion of transparency in service science by expanding the <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> scope to the mobile dimension...|$|R

40|$|Security advisors {{explore a}} client’s home to discover, document, explain, and {{recommend}} solutions for security problems. Evidence {{from the field}} shows that home-owners rarely follow through to implement better security. We re-imagine the advisory process from an information-transfer activity to a collaborative problem-solving activity. We use the precepts of collaboration engineering, including the Six Layer Model of Collaboration, {{to develop a new}} collaborative work system in which security experts and home owners work together to improve security. We provide evidence that the new work practice using the "SmartProtector" application based on new thinkLets for dyadic collaboration improves outcomes in the field. Results are interesting to three stakeholders. First, police officials, and other security advisors can use the approach to introduce collaborative security <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> in their cities. Second, development teams for future advisory systems in any domain can use our approach to capture the design rationale for their systems. Third, collaboration engineers and researchers can use and expand on the thinkLets we codified for reuse in designing <b>mobile</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

Results of the survey showed that among the technical components majority of the respondents opined that the information on advance warning of weather risks was very much adequate, the messages on plant protection were relevant and that the messages on advance warning of weather risks were timely.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of advice discounting in advice taking {{and the lack}} of motivational force in advice giving often hamper follow-up actions which are important to satisfy both advice seekers’ and advi-sors’ demands. This paper strives to diminish the well-known problem of advice discounting by invest-ing in a design study and creating a new information system supporting advisors. The prototype is mobile and provides multimedia interventions. These enable the advisors to activate advice takers on an emotional level with wow-factor episodes which strengthen advisors’ arguments. This study is af-fected by and evaluated in the practical field of home security advice. The evaluation points {{to the conclusion that the}} motivation to utilize given advice is higher in the IS-supported <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> compared to the conventional approach of plain speech-based advice giving. The paper contributes general design implications facing advice discounting in <b>mobile</b> and collaborative <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, it supports home security provider in designing their mobile service encounter to in-crease the advice implementation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The private sector's {{presence}} in agricultural <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> worldwide {{has been on}} the increase for over three decades. This trend has also been observed in the Mantaro Valley (Peru), in a context of dairy family farming. The objective of the article is to analyse the modalities of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> privatisation and assess the consequences of this privatisation for the farmers and their livestock systems. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through input suppliers, different types of advisers and producers interviews. Findings: The activity of private advisers is most often associated with the sale of livestock inputs which leads to an increase of production costs and does not take the overall producer needs into account. However, in line with the development of <b>mobile</b> phones, private <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> are facilitating access to technical support for almost all producers. Public <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> are less active and still focus on the use of inputs without adapting their services to the evolution of the advisory system. Theoretical implications: The study adds insights regarding the consequences of privatisation of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> for small farmers. It shows that inclusion is not always the main concern. The influence on the use of chemical inputs may be more important and may lead to both environmental and economic concerns. Practical implications: This study shows the importance of both improving and regulating the private <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and strengthening the coordination of advisory activities between public and private actors for an efficient agricultural advisory system. Originality/value: This study brings new insights regarding the development of private <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> supported by input suppliers and devoted to small family farms.

Data on corn and soybean net price received for <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> as reported by the AgMAS Project, are available for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 marketing years. Perfoffilance test results suggest that, on average, market <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> "beat the market " for the 1995 through 1997 corn and soybean crops. Possible explanations for this result include: i) a unique time period in corn and soybean markets, ii) inefficient commodity markets, iii) the skillfulness of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> or iv) a return to risk. The predictability results provide little evidence that <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> pricing perfoffilance can be predicted from year-to-year.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of {{intangible}} services regarding the risk of technological lock-in. It is based on the case of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> for farmers. Collective learning procedures are often considered by evolutionary economists as effective tools for policy makers. For instance, public investments in agricultural <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> could support farmers into shifting towards more environmental friendly practices. Nevertheless, this hypothesis relies on an ideal conception of <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> focused mainly on their contribution to learning procedures. Using some conceptual tools of the service economics enables to show that <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> can be themselves locked-in, due to their insertion in institutionalised balances of power. For instance, some Public-Private Partnerships with the upstream industry can reduce the contribution of the back-office investments of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> suppliers dedicated to the validation of knowledge about the relative performances of competing technologies...|$|R
