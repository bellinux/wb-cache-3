[...] Growing up, he played snooker, cricket, football, and the island's most popular sport, rugby. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an {{airplane}} technician who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of Tom Weiskopf, using it as an early model for his own.|$|E
2500|$|Chauncey Yellow Robe ("Kills in the Woods") (Canowicakte) {{was born}} {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Montana around 1867, in the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in Lakota or [...] "Burnt Thighs Nation." [...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wake me up out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare me to go out and lay down in the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if it was a man or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the Great Mystery. [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I {{must stay}} {{and face the}} music, as <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say. I {{do not wish to}} seem to run away, and, besides, I may be able to offer a {{suggestion}} now and then." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I believe so, {{in a sort}} of way," [...] he answered. [...] "My {{father was}} Hamel the artist, you know. They made him an R.A. some time before he died. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> come out here and live in a tent. Then Mr. Fentolin let him use this place and finally sold it <b>to</b> him. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> often <b>to</b> speak to me about it before he died." ...|$|R

60|$|I bowed, {{and with}} some coldness, for I shared the dislike which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> profess for this unfrocked priest and perjured politician; but his manner was so {{polished}} and engaging {{that it was hard}} to hold out against it.|$|E
60|$|There stood this mammoth, this leviathan, this monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, as I {{remember}} <b>my</b> old <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> call {{a certain}} gigantic and misshapen bull {{that we had}} on the Station, flapping a pair of ears that looked like the sides of a Kafir hut, and waving a trunk {{as big as a}} weaver's beam--whatever a weaver's beam may be--an appalling and a petrifying sight.|$|R

6000|$|... "For that matter," [...] {{said the}} grave-digger, [...] "it comes {{into my mind}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> call it the stamp of Satan's foot, because he claimed the dead man for his own.

6000|$|The narrator {{shook his}} head.

6000|$|... "What made ye sae late?" [...] said Mr. Jarvie, as I {{entered the}} dining-parlour of that honest gentleman; [...] "it is chappit ane the best feek o' five minutes by-gane.

6000|$|... 'Wha kens?' {{answered}} he; 'they're queer deevils; maybe I {{might just}} have 'scaped ae gang {{to meet the}} other.

60|$|But he himself--though Mrs Monnerie, I {{discovered}} {{after he}} was gone, had not even noticed that he was bald--he himself interested me far more than his excellent advice; and not least when he drew some papers out of a pocket-book, and happened to let fall on the carpet the photograph of a fat little boy with an immense mop of curls. So men--quite elderly, practical men, can blush, I thought to myself; for Dr Phelps had rather flushed than blushed; and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> only <b>to</b> get red.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; I {{often feel}} that, when I {{think of the}} hard {{struggle}} she must have had. Though I was very young then, I can remember the shabby boardinghouses we stayed in, and my mother’s pale, anxious face when she and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> talk in the evenings. He seldom speaks about those days, but I know he does not forget.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s {{nothing to}} fear," [...] said the other. [...] "I don’t believe {{for a moment}} that ghosts could really-hurt one.

6000|$|... "But she won't be lovely a bit the more. She'll {{grow old}} all the same, and take to drink very like. When she's got a red {{nose and a}} pimply face, and a sharp tongue, you'd be glad enough to see her at the wash-tub then.

6000|$|... "Umph!"
