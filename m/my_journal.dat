500|$|My {{survey of}} Rasay did not furnish much which can {{interest}} my readers; I shall therefore put into as short a compass as I can, the observations upon it, which I find registered in <b>my</b> <b>journal.</b> It is about fifteen English miles long, and four broad. On {{the south side}} is the laird’s family seat, situated on a pleasing low spot. The old tower of three stories, mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon after 1746, and a modern house supplies its place. There are very good grass-fields and corn-lands about it, well dressed. I observed, however, hardly any inclosures, except a good garden plentifully stocked with vegetables, and strawberries, raspberries, currants, ...|$|E
500|$|When his {{immediate}} superior, Major General Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, was temporarily {{transferred to the}} Army General Staff in November 1939, Brett acted as Chief of the Air Corps. In May 1941, he formally became Chief of the Air Corps for a four-year term, but the June 1941 reorganisation that made Arnold the Chief of United States Army Air Forces made the post of Chief of the Air Corps somewhat redundant. Brett {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom to determine how the Army Air Forces could better support Royal Air Force Lend-Lease requirements. His recommendation that American labor and facilities be established in the United Kingdom to handle the repair, assembly, and equipping of American aircraft created a stir {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and was ultimately disapproved by Arnold on the grounds that the personnel and equipment were not available. Brett next paid a visit to the Middle East where his outspoken criticism of arrangements there antagonised his hosts to the extent that the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, complained about him to the Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder noted that [...] "the charms of General Brett’s company were beginning to pall. After a talk with him on the afternoon of 25 September I wondered in <b>my</b> <b>journal</b> how he and all the American visitors ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{summer of}} the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the {{alarming}} meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By <b>my</b> <b>journal</b> I find that I had noticed this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious awe, at the red, louring aspect of the sun; ...|$|E

The students also believed that they learned the content more deeply and retained it better. Additionally, implementing mathematical journals caused me to emphasize the use of correct terminology and thorough explanations of mathematical thinking in classroom discussions.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{examined}} my thinking and professional growth {{through the use}} of reflective journals. The study documents my understanding and use of reflective journals as a tool for learning and thinking over time. I examined <b>my</b> sixteen reflective <b>journals</b> {{in an effort to make}} sense out of what it means to be a teacher. In this study I was guided by the question: What are the ways in which I reflect and think about myself as a teacher and my teaching, as evidenced through <b>my</b> <b>journals.</b> Analysis focused in four areas. The first was on the content of the <b>journals.</b> This included <b>my</b> topics, issues, and questions which I wrote about. A second analysis examined how I used <b>my</b> <b>journals</b> to think and reflect. A third component explored how I reflected on my beliefs and practices. The fourth area identified what supported and interfered with my thinking and reflecting. Through this study I examined my learning process and the ways that I use <b>journals</b> to support <b>my</b> thinking and professional development. My findings inform other teachers to consider reflective practice and supports the use of narrative for research. This study provides implications for teacher educators and professional developers to consider participants' prior knowledge and current beliefs when implementing professional programs. Participants need to be recognized as part of the process when involved in professional development...|$|R
