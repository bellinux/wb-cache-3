25|$|In {{red wine}} {{production}} {{the timing of}} when to press {{is one of the}} most important decisions in the wine making process since that will be the moment that maceration and phenolic extraction ceases. Some winemakers use the decreasing sugar level (such as brix <b>measurement)</b> <b>scale</b> and press once the wine has reached complete dryness. Often winemakers will use taste to determine if the wine has extracted enough tannins to produce a balanced wine and may press before complete dryness (such as at 3-8 brix). Though removing the skins by pressing often removes some solids that the wine yeast need to complete fermentation and the benefits of pressing early is often balanced by the risk of potential stuck fermentation.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of supply}} chain {{management}} processes in achieving competitive advantages in the service industry has been widely discussed. However, {{due to the lack}} of valid <b>measurement</b> <b>scales,</b> the effects of service {{supply chain management}} (SSCM) process capability cannot be ascertained. This study aims to develop and validate <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> for SSCM process capability constructs. The <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> were initially developed by literature review, and refined by Q-sort method. The SSCM process capability is a seven-dimensional construct; each dimension consists of a collection of unidimensional multi-item scales. Confirmatory factor analyses of a large-scale survey confirmed the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the multidimensional construct of seven SSCM process capabilities. The validated <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> lay a crucial foundation for advancing knowledge of the service supply chain by enabling future empirical studies in the field, which previously relied on largely conceptual frameworks and descriptive accounts of SSCM processes...|$|R

In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati {{came to the conclusion that}} a robust <b>measurement</b> <b>scale</b> of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be well advised to continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to review}} college student study time. Study time {{is one of}} the {{significant}} variables to understand how well each college manages its curriculum. Colleges conduct student survey and measure how much time students spend on homework or assignments each week, often employing categorized <b>measurement</b> <b>scales.</b> Scholars point out that Japanese students do not study as much as the US students do. Japanese governments demand each college to make students study at least two hours outside classroom by one credit. In this manner, measuring precise study time becomes more important for college educational management. However, categorized <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> cannot capture precise time as each category has a particular time span (for example, 3 to 5 hours). This study examines how much precisely study time is measured by categorized scales. For comparison, this study conducted study time through the students’ records of daily life including study. Compared with the difference in outcomes conducted both by <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> and the records of daily life, this study finds that there are large differences in both study times. In addition, this study explores what students study outside classroom, and finds that students do not only homework and “narrow-sense” study, but also some try to obtain competencies through part-time work, club activities, and so on. To conclude, I suggest that using <b>measurement</b> <b>scales</b> is not necessarily relevant to the measurement of precise study time, and that we need to discuss what students should learn outside classroom in consideration of the need of competency development...|$|R
