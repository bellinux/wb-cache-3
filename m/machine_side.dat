50|$|Even if {{the demands}} for low {{tolerances}} of the wire and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the <b>machine</b> <b>side</b> has to follow the previously described winding design also at high winding speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at high winding speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the wire guide for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified {{by the fact that}} in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the winding of the wire on delivery rolls have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the with-in wafer {{non-uniformity}} (WIWNU) {{of material}} removal rate and its optimization are discussed from both the <b>machine</b> <b>side</b> and consumable side. At the <b>machine</b> <b>side,</b> the pressure and velocity distribution are the major reasons for the non-uniform {{material removal rate}} across the wafer. The velocity distributions for the rotational type and linear type of machines are analyzed systematically. The rotational part of the velocity is the contributor of the velocity non-uniformity. The pressure non-uniformity in both cases of the solid-solid contact and the solid-fluid-solid contact are discussed. Adding the retaining ring is {{an effective way to}} reduce the pressure non-uniformity {{at the edge of the}} wafer in the solid-solid contact mode. In the solid-fluid-solid contact mode, the friction coefficient is identified as the major contributor to the non-uniformity. A process window of pressure and velocity in terms of small non-uniformity can be obtained by combining the model proposed in this report and the Stribeck curve of the friction coefficients. At the consumable side, a systematic method is proposed to optimize the WIWNU in solid-solid contact mode, based on the material removal model developed in previous works [5, 6, 7]. The basic idea is to reduce the sensitivity of the material removal on pressure and velocity distribution...|$|E
