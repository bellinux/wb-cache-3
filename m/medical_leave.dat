40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} review of the literature about <b>medical</b> <b>leaves</b> due to mental and behavioral disorders and return to work of teachers. There are scarce published manuscripts. Most articles relate with prevalence of mental disorders and factors associated with the work organization, and did not mention intervention proposals and or changes in the work organization and teaching work. Proposed actions are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the Family and <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 2012, Jackson took a <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> {{of absence}} from the House, citing exhaustion. On July 11, 2012, Jackson's office said he was being treated for a mood {{disorder}} at a residential treatment facility. His office denied speculation {{that he was being}} treated for alcoholism. On August 13, 2012 it was confirmed by numerous news outlets that Jackson was being treated for bipolar disorder.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was given}} a <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> of absence {{following}} Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. The department was a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and {{in no position to}} mount an offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.|$|E
50|$|Of weak {{constitution}} since childhood, Prince Arisugawa took frequent <b>medical</b> <b>leaves</b> {{during his}} naval career. He built a summer home in Kobe {{and went into}} semi-retirement in 1909. Prince Arisugawa died on July 3, 1913 at his Kobe residence. However, news of his death was not made immediately public, and his body was rushed back to his palace in Kōjimachi, Tokyo by a specially chartered train, and his death formally announced on July 10, 1913.|$|R

50|$|James Paul Casciano is an American college {{basketball}} coach {{and the former}} head men's basketball coach at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He stepped down after going 0-29 with the Highlanders in 2007-08 although he was not physically there for a 12-game leave of absence (coached by assistant coach Wendell Alexis during his <b>medical</b> <b>leaves),</b> which is the worst winless season in unofficial NCAA Division I basketball history (record does not officially count because NJIT was transiting from Division II to Division I during that period).|$|R
5|$|Coming {{into his}} junior year on the 2014–15 team, Dunham {{was named to the}} Preseason All-Big East First Team. Dunham stopped {{drinking}} Mountain Dew prior to the season to improve his conditioning. Coach Brandon Miller took a <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> of absence before the season and did not return; he was replaced by Chris Holtmann. Dunham was on the Battle 4 Atlantis All-tournament Team. Dunham scored a season-high 28 points on January 3, 2015 in a 73–69 win over St. John's. Dunham received Big East Player of the Week honors for the week of February 9, after scoring 21 points and pulling down seven rebounds in an 85–62 victory versus St. John's and recording 24 points in an 83–73 win over DePaul.|$|E
5|$|During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had {{to adapt}} his {{artillery}} tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with {{various types of}} mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before {{he was able to}} act on this, on June 30, 1864, he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise, although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee's army in the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E

5|$|On 1 December 1943, the {{division}} {{was once again}} renamed. Now known as the 77th (Holding) Division, it was responsible for retraining soldiers {{who had been on}} <b>medical</b> <b>leave.</b> Once recruits were fully trained, and men returning from injury retrained, they were allocated to formations fighting overseas. Notably, the formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group, which was fighting in Normandy. After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France, {{the division}} was disbanded and re-formed as a deception unit to give Germany the impression that the British army had more divisions than it did. The notional 77th Division was held in reserve within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division was out {{of action}} for some months. It finally moved {{with the rest of}} the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of {{fighting}} and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia. Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{temporarily}} disgraced by the surprise attack and near defeat, causing his superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, to assume field {{command of the}} combined armies. Halleck cautiously and slowly approached Beauregard's fortifications at Corinth; his action became derisively called the Siege of Corinth. Beauregard withdrew from Corinth on May 29 to Tupelo, Mississippi. He was able to deceive Halleck into thinking the Confederates were about to attack; he ran empty trains {{back and forth through}} the town while whistles blew and troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving. Beauregard retreated because of the overwhelming Union force and because of contaminated water supplies in Corinth. In April and May, the Confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in Corinth as had been killed in battle at Shiloh. Nevertheless, his leaving the critical rail junction at Corinth without a fight was another controversial decision. When Beauregard went on <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> without requesting permission in advance, President Davis relieved him of command and replaced him with Gen. Braxton Bragg.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this article}} is to tackle the brain drain {{phenomenon}} in the health sector in Romania, focusing on the dichotomy brain drain-brain circulation. Between 2007 and 2010, 8131 <b>medical</b> doctors <b>leaved</b> the country. However, statistics on permanent migration emphasize a not so worrying situation: in the same period of time, 1066 medical doctors changed their permanent residence. The profile of the emigrant include young <b>medical</b> doctors, <b>leaving</b> Romania at the early stage of their career. Whether they are exponents of permanent or circular migration depends on our country's ability in offering them incentives for returning. Primary data sources and results of qualitative and quantitative studies available in the literature are used in the attempt of offering an answer to the controversial issue of Romanian physicians...|$|R

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the XII Corps was {{transferred}} to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga. At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in the face, with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of <b>medical</b> <b>leave,</b> he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot out from under him. At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh and the pursuit of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them {{at the beginning of}} March. They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it {{was announced}} that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> in December 2012.|$|E

5000|$|The {{prominence}} {{he earned}} in the Senate {{led to his}} becoming its Provisional President in 1876, whereby he served as acting President of Argentina during the ailing Nicolás Avellaneda's frequent <b>medical</b> <b>leaves</b> of absence. Newly elected in 1880, President Julio Roca supported Rocha's candidacy as Governor of Buenos Aires Province, the nation's most important and most politically contentious at the time. Following a failed insurrection against the Roca regime, his message of political integration with the suddenly prosperous Argentina persuaded the province's voters, and he was elected governor in 1881. Facing ongoing secessionist pressures from his constituency, Governor Rocha proposed {{the creation of a}} new provincial capital in replacement of the city of Buenos Aires, which was federalized as the nation's capital in 1880. The proposal, useful to the mollification of the province's independence-leaning gentry, was quickly approved by Congress.|$|R
