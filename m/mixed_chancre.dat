40|$|We {{report a}} case of dengue fever without {{a few of the}} {{pathognomonic}} signs in the hope of warning that there are some dangers of overlooking the importation of the viruses and of epidemics due to the presence of the vector mosquitos. A 22 -year-old, male student had 6 weeks' trip to Thailand and Indonesia in summer, 1972. On the 2 nd day after his returning, low-grade fever with enlargement of the right inguinal node developed. Seven days later a chancre occurred on the frenulum of the penis. Under the diagnosis of <b>mixed</b> <b>chancre</b> cephalexin was given, and the temperature dropped. On the 16 th day after his return he had a high fever, with chills, arthralgia and anorexia. Fever persisted for two weeks. The temperature curve was a remitting type. There was no shaking, nausea, vomiting, cough, hemorrhagic tendency or rash. Neurologic examination was negative. Besides the above-mentioned bubo, no lymphadenopathy was noted. Though there was no saddleback type of temperature curve or rash, the patient's prior stay in the endemic areas, severe anorexia, leucopenia and arthralgia aroused suspicion of dengue fever. Complement fixation tests for dengue viruses-type I, II, III and IV- were performed on the sera obtained on the sixth hospital day (i. e. the 22 nd day after his return) and on the 16 th hospital day. Titers of the former serum were 1 : 4, 1 : 4, 1 : 8 and 1 : 4 for type I, II, III and IV, respectively, while those of the latter serum 1 : 4, 1 : 128, 1; 64 and 1 : 32, respectively, Thus, this case was diagnosed as to be infected with dengue virus, type II. The temperature gradually fell to normal. The patient progressed satisfactory, and has continued to be asymptomatic. An extention of international travel has increased the danger of epidemics. In Japan Aedes albopictus are not unusual, though both the breeding places and numbers are much less than those during the explosive epidemics in 1942...|$|E
