Plasma deposition was realized on the external PET layer of the substrate by using a RF plasma source and two different precursors (trimethylsilane (TMS) and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)). Two types of monolayer deposits (SiOx and SiOxCzHw) were investigated for each precursor. The structure and composition of the deposited coatings were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and XPS analysis. Their surface topography was imaged by AFM and the surface energy was determined thanks to contact angle measurements. Oxygen and water barrier properties of the coated substrate were interpreted in terms of coating structure and composition and TMS was identified as the most interesting precursor for enhanced barrier properties. The sensitivity of the coatings to thermal exposure was also investigated. A <b>multilayer</b> <b>deposit</b> approach consisting in alternating organic and inorganic deposited layers was developed.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} and tribocorrosion behaviour of thermally sprayed coatings and thermally sprayed/nanoscale multilayer CrN/NbN coatings {{deposited on}} steel specimens {{has been studied}} in 3. 5 % NaCl solutions. The thermally sprayed coatings are bulk HVOF deposits with nominal composition WC- 12 Co and Cr 3 C 2 - 37 WC- 18 Me, while the nanoscale <b>multilayer</b> <b>deposit,</b> topping the thermally sprayed ones, is a CrN/NbN coating, obtained by PVD magnetron sputtering technique. Combined wear-corrosion conditions have been achieved by sliding an alumina antagonist on the lateral surface of coated steel cylinders, during their exposure to the aggressive solution. Polarization curves recorded after 1 h of immersion and polarization resistance values monitored during 3 days exposures showed that under free corrosion conditions Cr 3 C 2 - 37 WC- 18 Me always exhibits low corrosion rates and efficiently protects the underlying steel substrate from corrosion. Even on WC- 12 Co-coated specimens, low corrosion rates are measured at long immersion times. Both cermet coatings suffer severe corrosion attack under tribocorrosion conditions. On the contrary, the duplex nanoscale multilayer CrN/NbN /WC- 12 Co deposit affords very good corrosion resistance both in the absence and {{in the presence of}} wear, within the studied exposure period. SEM observations and EDS analyses have also been carried out to characterize the original powder and coating microstructures and to assess the damage extent {{at the end of the}} corrosion and tribocorrosion tests...|$|E

To obtain more insights into the mechanisms underlying this transfer and multilayer formation, we established a simple model system that captures different features of SP-B action. We monitored the formation of supported planar bilayers from the collapse of intact phospholipid vesicles on a silica surface using a technique called quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, which provides information on changes in membrane thickness and viscosity. At physiologically relevant concentrations, SP-B dramatically alters vesicle collapse. This manifests itself as a reduced buildup of intact vesicles on the surface before collapse, and allows the stepwise buildup of <b>multilayered</b> <b>deposits.</b> Accumulation of lipids in these <b>multilayer</b> <b>deposits</b> requires the presence of SP-B in both the receptor and the arriving membranes, surrounded by a comparable phospholipid charge.
