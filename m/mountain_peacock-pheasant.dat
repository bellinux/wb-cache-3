25|$|The Pheasant Aviary {{is a long}} row of cages home to a large {{variety of}} bird species, {{particularly}} pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> Mérida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), Swinhoe's pheasant, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo. Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans.|$|E

50|$|A shy and elusive bird, the <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is {{distributed}} and endemic to montane {{forests of the}} central Malay Peninsula. The diet consists mainly of berries, beetles and ants.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size and limited range, the <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES in Malaysia.|$|E
5000|$|... mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G data confirms that this species belongs to a clade together with the <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> but also the mainland species Germain's peacock-pheasant and grey peacock-pheasant (Kimball et al. 2001).|$|E
50|$|Besides its flora, the {{district}} is also noted for being a shelter {{for a wide variety}} of animals, birds, reptiles and insects. Of these, the Sumatran serow, <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> and Malayan whistling-thrush are listed in the 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} of {{this species}} is fairly enigmatic. mtDNA cytochrome b and D-loop {{as well as the}} nuclear ovomucoid intron G sequence data confirms that it belongs to a largely Continental Asian clade together with Germain's peacock-pheasant (P. germaini), but also the [...] "brown" [...] southern species bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant (P. chalcurum) and <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (P. inopinatum).|$|E
50|$|The Free Range Aviary is home {{tropical}} forest dwelling birds such as pink pigeon, <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Within the aviary are some enclosed animal exhibits that {{are home to}} animals such as scarlet macaws and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|E

Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> Mérida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), Swinhoe's pheasant, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo.

50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-{{pheasant}}</b> (Polyplectron inopinatum) {{also known}} as Rothschild's peacock-pheasant or mirror pheasant is a medium-sized, up to 65 cm long, blackish brown pheasant with small ocelli and long graduated tail feathers. Both sexes are similar. The male has metallic blue ocelli on upperparts, green ocelli on tail of twenty feathers and two spurs on legs. Female has black ocelli on upperparts, unspurred legs and tail of eighteen feathers. The female is smaller and duller than male.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} of {{this species}} is somewhat enigmatic. mtDNA cytochrome b and D-loop {{as well as the}} nuclear ovomucoid intron G data confirms that it belongs to a clade together with the grey peacock-pheasant, but also the [...] "brown" [...] southernly species bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant and <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant.</b> Biogeography suggests that it may indeed be the most ancient form in its clade, speciating parapatrically or peripatrically in Cochinchina (Kimball et al. 2001). This probably took place in the Late Pliocene, roughly 4-3 mya.|$|E
50|$|Most of the galliform {{birds are}} more or less resident, but some of the smaller {{temperate}} species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (Centrocercus), crested partridge, green peafowl, crested argus, <b>mountain</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron inopinatum), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Reeves's pheasant and (Syrmaticus reevesii). Other species—most of the New World quails (also known as the toothed quails), the enigmatic stone partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (Crossoptilon)—are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.|$|E
