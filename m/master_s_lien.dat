40|$|Since September 20, 1957, the Nebraska {{oil and gas}} lien statute {{has been}} in effect. Prior to its passage, Nebraska had only a general {{mechanic}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute. With a growing oil and gas drilling industry, it soon became apparent that due to the complexities and uniqueness of {{the oil and gas}} drilling business, the general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute had many shortcomings when it was stretched to include this industry. In some of these states the oil and gas drilling industry was brought within the terms of the more general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes either by judicial construction or by slight amendment of their already existing mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes. In other jurisdictions, particularly those with a significant oil and gas drilling industry, special oil and gas lien statutes were enacted. Even though Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute can and often does cover many wide and varied contingencies, the complexities of the oil and gas drilling industry convinced many that a special statute, addressed specifically to this growing industry, was needed. As the oil and gas drilling industry in Nebraska grows in significance, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas lien statute will likewise grow in significance. It should become a necessary and familiar tool to those attorneys who do oil and gas work in Nebraska. While Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s statute is similar to other oil and gas lien statutes, many questions concerning this statute are at present unanswered...|$|R

It argued that a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in industrial design would help graduates specialize in the related field and improve their skills. Therefore, this study consists of fundamental components about <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> studies in industrial design in turkey such as, existing circumstances of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree, defining its problems and requirements, and resolution advisories to education. Seven universities offer a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in the field of industrial design in Turkey. In the study, comparative analysis of these programs is conducted on their current education system and two survey studies are realized among the academics of these universities, to examine their opinions. In the field study, the increase number of department facilities was underlined as one of the positive developments whereas problems concerning the academic staff of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> programs came into prominence as the most important weaknesses. In addition, the required improvements of YOK criteria for the discipline were also found a critical situation for the future of programs.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} advantages of a secured transaction is the protection it provides against the claims of competing creditors. A creditor asserting a security interest in his debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property is likely to find himself in competition with a wide assortment of other claimants. For example, his security interest may be challenged by another creditor with a consensual security interest, by a creditor with a judgment or execution lien, by a creditor claiming a right to the collateral under some general statutory entitlement such as a repairman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien,</b> by a seller to or a buyer from the debtor, or by the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s trustee in bankruptcy.

40|$|The {{importance}} of innovative entrepreneurship for {{sustained economic growth}} is increasing (IMF, 2017). This is the fundamental motivation for this thesis, in which a study on team maturity, innovation capability, and firm performance in Norwegian entrepreneurships has been performed. The study has contributed with new insight in this area, as well as identifying several interesting elements for further research. Two research questions have guided the study: RQ 1 : Is there an effect on firm performance from team maturity and innovation capability in entrepreneurships? And RQ 2 : Is there an effect from University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> programs in entrepreneurship on team maturity, innovation capability and/or firm performance in entrepreneurships? In sum, {{it was found that}} high team maturity in entrepreneurial teams leads to high innovation capability for the entrepreneurship. There was found a more varied degree of support for that high innovation capability leads to high firm performance in entrepreneurships, and that high team maturity leads to high firm performance moderated by innovation capability in entrepreneurships. A positive relationship was found via some methods, however the findings were not consistent across other methods. Further investigation of these relationships in other studies is therefore recommended before any final conclusions can be drawn. Especially, the understanding of firm performance in entrepreneurships should be studied further. As for RQ 2, this study has consistently not found any positive effect on team maturity, innovation capability, or firm performance from the affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship. It was also found that the entrepreneurships with an affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship were less inclined to use the team as an arena for innovation than the entrepreneurships without such an affiliation. It is recommended that further research look into these relationships to strengthen the understanding of the causes for these findings...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{one aspect}} of the law regarding the satisfaction of judgments: when a creditor is determined to have a lien on property of the debtor. The unnecessary cumbersomeness of the present system, which limits the ability of creditors to promptly obtain a legally cognizable interest in specific property, hampers creditors in preventing the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s use, sale, or hypothecation of property {{that could be used to}} satisfy their debts. This is particularly true of intangible property and property where federal law or the law of sister states controls transfers. Not only do judgment creditors face the risk that the debtor will voluntarily dissipate or transfer assets, but also the risk that they will be defeated by subsequent parties who deal with the debtor, become creditors, and are able to find assets. Possibly the most pernicious of those subsequent creditors are the federal and state taxing authorities. The tax lien, once filed, locks in all personal and real property of the debtor. Bankruptcy also presents a serious difficulty for the judgment creditor. If the debtor files for bankruptcy before the creditor can locate personal property of the debtor, the creditor (despite having obtained a judgment) has no greater priority than all of the unsecured creditors of the debtor. If the judgment creditor locates personal property and obtains a lien on that property shortly before the date that the debtor files a Bankruptcy petition, the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> can be avoided as a preference. Even where a debtor files a Chapter 11 petition and maintains control of the business as a debtor in possession, the debtor can still use the preference section to avoid the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien.</b> This article proposes that the computer systems currently being introduced to automate court systems around the country serve as the vehicle for the implementation of major reforms in the substantive and procedural law regarding judicial liens. The most significant change would involve the creation of statewide judgment liens on virtually all of the property of the debtor. This article will explore how the proposed system might deal with various types of property and particular third parties, and how to solve some of the transitional problems involved in adopting such a system. The changes proposed are incorporated in a Model Judgment Lien Act (MJLA) which is set forth in the Appendix of this article. It is hoped that the MJLA makes clear precisely how the rules discussed in the article would operate...|$|R
