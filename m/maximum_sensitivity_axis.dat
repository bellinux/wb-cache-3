40|$|A {{directional}} {{acoustical sensor}} with programmable <b>axis</b> of <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is described. The sensor {{is based on}} a combination of two orthogonal acoustical particle velocity (APV) sensors, integrated on the same chip. The APV sensors are based on a thermal transduction principle. Differently from former implementations, the proposed devices are fully CMOS compatible. Rotation of the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>axis</b> is obtained by combining the output of the two APV sensors properly weighted with programmable coefficients. This operation is performed using a microcontroller ADuC 842 (Analog Devices) equipped with 12 bit, 400 kS ADCs...|$|R
40|$|Session - Fundamentals 1 : no. FU 2 -PO 02 We {{propose that}} the ICP-MS {{sampling}} position for <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of an element depends on the ionization potential of the element and the boiling point of corresponding oxide. The boiling point governs {{the position of the}} aerosol in the ICP where the vaporization starts. The ionization potential governs the degree of ionization of the element. The positions for high degree of vaporization and ionization may not coincide. The sampling position for <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the element is determined by the process that is more energy-demanding. The process that is less energy-demanding, however, has a strong effect on the sampling depth profile. In this study, the positions for <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 19 selected elements in the form of aqueous solution were determined. The vaporization process has insignificant effect on the position of <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The main factor governing the position is the ionization. The shape of the sampling depth profiles depends on the difference in position for initial vaporization of the dried aerosols and significant ionization of the element, The position for <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of elements of high ionization potential but volatile dried aerosol is farther away from the initial vaporization position. The difference in positions is smaller for elements of low ionization potential and refractory dried particle. The above observation was applied to single-particle ICP-MS. The discrete particles are of particle size larger than the dried aerosols of standard solutions and may require more time for complete vaporization. It is interesting that the positions of <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for aqueous solution and discrete Au and ZrO 2 nanoparticles were comparable. The findings may be used for the estimation of sampling position for <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for SP-ICP-MS using aqueous solutions.

The orthogonal fluxgate sensor was fabricated with a Co-based amorphous wire with 10 mm long and 100 μm in the diameter and a 270 -turn pickup coil wound on the amorphous wire. In order to investigate the frequency dependence of the sensitivity, output spectra of the sensor which was connected by using a coax-ial cable with various lengths of 0. 5 - 5 m were measured with a RF lock-in amplifier.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effect on a display gamut of varying the optical density and the position of the <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the cones spectra of anomalous trichromatic observers. The anomalous cone spectral sensitivities were estimated for a set of varying optical density and <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> spectra conditions and used to compute the display color gamut. The computed display gamut simulated for normal observers the chro- matic diversity perceived by anomalous observers. It was found that even small variations on the optical density and on the position of the <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> spectra {{have an impact on the}} simulations of the display gamut for anomalous observers.

40|$|The {{underwater}} {{hearing sensitivity}} of a two-year-old harbor porpoise {{was measured in}} a pool using standard psycho-acoustic techniques. The go/no-go response paradigm and up–down staircase psychometric method were used. Auditory sensitivity was measured by using narrow-band frequency-modulated signals having center frequencies between 250 Hz and 180 kHz. The resulting audiogram was U-shaped with the range of best hearing (defined as 10 dB within <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity)</b> from 16 to 140 kHz, with a reduced sensitivity around 64 kHz. <b>Maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (about 33 dB re 1 ?Pa) occurred between 100 and 140 kHz. This <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> range corresponds with the peak frequency of echolocation pulses produced by harbor porpoises (120 – 130 kHz). Sensitivity falls about 10 dB per octave below 16 kHz and falls off sharply above 140 kHz (260 dB per octave). Compared to a previous audiogram of this species (Andersen, 1970), the present audiogram shows less sensitive hearing between 2 and 8 kHz and more sensitive hearing between 16 and 180 kHz. This harbor porpoise has the highest upper-frequency limit of all odontocetes investigated. The time it took for the porpoise to move its head 22 cm after the signal onset (movement time) was also measured.

In addition, based on these criteria a radio quiet area or zone could be a tool to mitigate the impact of transmitting radio stations while taking into account the specificities for terrestrial, aeronautical and space-based radio stations.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of many noble gas mass spectrometers to ionize gas species {{is known to}} be a function of the pressure of gas in the spectrometer. This work shows how the half plate voltage for maximum He or Ar signal depends on the spectrometer pressure and shows that the half plate voltage for <b>maximum</b> 4 He <b>sensitivity</b> does not coincide with the half plate voltage for <b>maximum</b> 3 He <b>sensitivity.</b> In addition, half plate voltage has a greater control on sensitivity at higher spectrometer pressures. Variations in He and Ar sensitivity and isotopic discrimination as a function of pressure are due, at least in part, to these variations in the position of <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with respect to half plate voltage. The <b>maximum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> settings shift to lower half plate voltage at high spectrometer pressures, irrespective of if the pressure increase is due to the gas being investigated or a different species. Therefore noble gas mass spectrometers should always be tuned at the maximum possible pressure; measurements at higher pressures should be avoided. Significant errors in the spectrometer sensitivity and discrimination can result from improper tuning and calibration of noble gas mass spectrometers...|$|R
