5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels {{have been found}} to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks.|$|E

There were 25 border checkpoints manned by UNCRO. The mandate also directed UNCRO to monitor demilitarisation of the Prevlaka Peninsula {{at the entrance to the}} Bay of Kotor, according to the UNSC Resolution 779. Deployment of UNCRO was formally approved by the UNSC on 28 April. The mission was scheduled to be scaled down in June to 8,750 troops from the larger UNPROFOR force in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 the Italian {{physician}} Carlo Urbani (1956–2003) was {{the first}} to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.|$|E

When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week. The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels. The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.|$|E

To {{improve the quality of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting,</b> Egypt has received support from the Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories.
