25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the <b>message</b> <b>out</b> even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the <b>message</b> <b>out</b> and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E

500|$|Luc Besson {{stated that}} he was not {{interested}} in narrating the history of Joan of Arc; rather, he wanted to pull a <b>message</b> <b>out</b> of history that is relevant for today. Besson states that in order to achieve this he stepped away from the factual narrative of the 15th century, instead trying to get behind the [...] "exterior envelope" [...] and into both the emotional effect and affect of Joan. In the book The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward interprets this as meaning Besson sought to follow Joan emotionally, revealing her doubts and demonstrating that one cannot return intact from the experience of war.|$|E

His plan was discovered and he was put on trial in January 1969; desperate to avoid a death sentence, he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments. Mugabe denounced Sithole's [...] "treachery" [...] in rejecting ZANU's cause, and the executive removed him as ZANU President in a vote of no confidence, selecting Mugabe as his successor. In November 1974, the ZANU executive voted to suspend Sithole's membership of the organisation.|$|E

500|$|According to Carey, writing [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{helped her}} get through rough {{emotional}} moments with her label's management, and even {{times when she}} felt overwhelmed by others. During {{the early stages of}} the album, Carey said she felt pressured to complete the Rainbow album as quickly as possible, due to the fact that it was the last album under her contract with Columbia. During troubled times for the singer, as well as her divorce from record executive Tommy Mottola, she claimed writing and singing the song helped her get through troubled times and hoped her listeners would get the same <b>message</b> <b>out</b> of it. Carey thought it would become an anthem for fans and listeners who were going through difficult times in their life and could relate to the song. Additionally, during the taping of the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, Carey told audience members that after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, she felt the song would help family members and friends of the victims during the tragedy, and hoped it would give them strength to get by the tragic event. For that reason, Carey included the song on the album, and campaigned for its radio release in mid-2000.|$|E

However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster Landscape XX (Penis Landscape) included with the album. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost-effective way of sending a <b>message</b> <b>out</b> to other musicians with content considered offensive in their music.|$|E

Betty Chu also worked to raise funds and to get her <b>message</b> <b>out,</b> telling voters that she {{had a great deal of}} experience as a long-time attorney, banker, entrepreneur, and elected official.

[...] She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter Chelsea Clinton to refer to the secretary as [...] "TechnoMom".|$|E
