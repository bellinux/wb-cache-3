5|$|The {{first trip}} {{was at the}} behest of The Sunday Timess {{features}} editor Leonard Russell; the paper's chairman, Roy Thomson, enjoyed the series so <b>much</b> <b>he</b> requested Fleming undertook a second trip. The book version includes material edited out of the original articles, as well as photographs of the various cities.|$|E
5|$|Tyrone {{were one}} of the favourites for the 2002 All-Ireland, having won their first National Football League in the spring, but ended up losing a {{qualifying}} match to Sligo, even though Canavan scored six points on the day. That particular defeat stunned him so <b>much,</b> <b>he</b> considered retiring Inter County football.|$|E

5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work so <b>much</b> <b>he</b> contemplated studying for a mining degree. Soon afterwards {{his interest in}} aviation was stimulated again {{by the arrival of}} a logistics aeroplane at the mine. He requested a flight which he enjoyed immensely. Consequently, Pattle changed his mind about engineering and opted to find a career as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|Lisa is {{participating}} in a school talent show and needs a new reed for her saxophone. Her father, Homer, agrees to buy one, but decides to visit Moe's Tavern first. When he arrives at the music shop next door, it has closed for the night. Dejected, Homer goes back to Moe's to find its owner. Moe convinces the man to re-open his store. By the time Homer reaches the school with the new reed, however, Lisa has already butchered her performance. Humiliated and upset, she completely ignores Homer, who, from watching old family videos, soon realizes how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> has neglected her.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi's first {{fifteen years}} of service in Mantua are {{bracketed}} by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and {{the fourth and fifth}} books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How <b>much</b> <b>he</b> composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so <b>much</b> <b>he</b> dropped out of school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, {{he and a friend}} enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} with Epstein on 24 January 1962 which gave Epstein 10â€“15 per cent of their income. They signed a new contract in October 1962 which gave Epstein 15, 20, or 25 per cent of revenues, depending on how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> helped the band earn. The Beatles would then share any income after various expenses had been deducted. Epstein then formed a management company, NEMS Enterprises, telling his parents that managing the group was only a part-time occupation and would {{not interfere with the}} family business.|$|E

She and Sarah get drunk and sleep together, which they both regret and agree to keep quiet. Their one-night stand is later revealed, however, leaving Mike devastated. He throws them both out, before realising how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> loves Zoe and offering to take her back, only for her to refuse.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story <b>much,</b> <b>he</b> would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|Debbie and Darren have a brief {{relationship}}, but it ends {{when her}} boyfriend Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) returns from prison. He later begins {{a relationship with}} Steph, but ends it when she has an epileptic seizure, and he begins dating Zoe. Darren begins gambling, and becomes addicted. The relationship ends when Darren has sex with Zoe's best friend Jessica after he and Zoe fight over his gambling addiction. Darren steals Frankie Osborne's (Helen Pearson) jewellery to settle a debt with a loan shark, and blames Newt (Nico Mirallegro), who is sent back to care. Jack, unaware of Darren's addiction, gives him half The Dog in recognition of how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> has matured. Darren begins counselling for his gambling addiction, but later plays poker with Warren and loses his half of The Dog to him. Jack and Frankie discover that Darren has stolen Frankie's jewellery and lost his half of The Dog. Jack then has a heart attack which Darren blames himself for.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks about how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E

5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying lessons. To fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work so <b>much</b> <b>he</b> considered studying for a degree in mining engineering. His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 hoping it would lead to a career in the Air Force. He undertook basic training and national service on the understanding that he would be given an opportunity to enter the Air Force as an instructor {{at the end of his}} four-year service.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
