25|$|Before her launch on 23 May 1912, Cunard {{announced}} that their new ship, , which was under construction {{at the time}} at the John Brown shipyards in Glasgow, would be longer by one foot. There was chagrin in Hamburg. Several weeks later, she was fitted with an imposing bronze eagle figurehead, created by Professor Bruno Kruse of Berlin, which adorned her forepeak with a banner emblazoned with HAPAG's motto Mein Feld ist die Welt (<b>My</b> <b>field</b> is the world); this extension increased Imperator length sufficiently to (easily) surpass Aquitania. The eagle's wings were later torn off in an Atlantic storm during the 1914 season, after which it was removed and replaced with gold scroll-work which was similar to what was on her stern.|$|E
500|$|Fallen {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five: [...] "The... album does include flashes of the single's PG-rated nu-metal ("Everybody's Fool," [...] "Going Under"). But it's the symphonic goth rock of groups like Type O Negative that influences most of Fallen." [...] Entertainment Weekly, in a generally positive review, graded the album B-minus: [...] "The genre now {{too old to}} be called nü-metal isn't exactly overflowing with spine-tinglingly great vocalists – let alone female ones. Amy Lee, lead singer of gloomy Arkansas rockers Evanescence, is an exception." [...] In a mixed review, Kirk Miller of Rolling Stone gave Fallen three stars out of five: [...] "When vocalist Amy Lee croons about lying 'in <b>my</b> <b>field</b> of paper flowers' or 'pouring crimson regret,' she gives Fallen a creepy spiritual tinge that the new-metal boys lack." ...|$|E
500|$|Skelton's {{contract}} {{called for}} MGM's approval {{prior to his}} radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio {{and to be able}} to work on television, which was then largely experimental. [...] At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio's written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of The Fuller Brush Man, saying, [...] "Movies are not <b>my</b> <b>field.</b> Radio and television are." [...] He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. [...] In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the U.S. with his radio show.|$|E

Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E

In 1961 he was awarded a Henry Fellowship to Yale University.But it was later that year, whilst in Mexico, that Brading’s fascination with the country began, “I have now found <b>my</b> <b>field</b> of study: sixteenth-century Spain and Latin America”…The more I think of it, the more Latin America seems attractive. Sixteenth–century Spain, looking back to the Reconquista and forward to the Counter Reformation and the decadence.

2500|$|Wanrong wore a mask in {{accordance}} with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: [...] "I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into <b>my</b> <b>field</b> of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all curious about what she looked like." [...] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red [...] the color of love and sex in China [...] and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages. Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives {{to sleep in the}} Dragon Bed by themselves. About Puyi's failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:It was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters [...] this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: It would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung's [...] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.|$|E
