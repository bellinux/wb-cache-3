Examining the relationship between the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>and</b> the rating score of the unpleasantness revealed that the unpleasantness was in close correlation with the vibration acceleration level (VAL) of the <b>vibration</b> <b>measured.</b> Taking previous results into account, this finding suggests that noise-induced vibrations primarily induce vibratory sensations and through the vibratory sensation or together with some other factors, secondarily contribute to the unpleasantness.

40|$|PresentaciÃ³n oral SPIE Photonics Europe, Brussels, 16 - 19 April 2012. Analysis of <b>vibrations</b> <b>and</b> {{displacements}} is a {{hot topic}} in structural engineering. Video cameras can provide good accuracy at reasonable cost. Proper system configuration and adequate image processing algorithms provide a reliable method for <b>measuring</b> <b>vibrations</b> <b>and</b> displacements in structures. In this communication we propose using a pocket camera (Casio) for <b>measuring</b> small <b>vibrations</b> <b>and</b> displacements. Low end cameras can acquire high speed video sequences at very low resolutions. Nevertheless, many applications do not need precise replication of the scene, but detecting its relative position. By using targets with known geometrical shapes {{we are able to}} mathematically obtain subpixel information about its position and thus increase the system resolution. The proposal is demonstrated by using circular and elliptic targets on moving bodies The used method combines image processing and least squares fitting and the obtained accuracy multiplies by 10 the original resolution. Results form the low-end camera (400 â‚¬) working at 224 x 168 px are compared with those obtained with a high-end camera (10000 â‚¬) with a spatial resolution of 800 x 560 px. Although the low-end camera introduces a lot of noise in the detected trajectory, we obtained that results are comparable. Thus for particular applications, low-end pocket cameras can be a real alternative to more sophisticated and expensive devices.
