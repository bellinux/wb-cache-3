40|$|The gasdynamic mirror {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a concept which could {{form the basis of}} a highly efficient fusion rocket engine. Gasdynamic mirrors differ from most other mirror type plasma confinement schemes in that they have much larger aspect ratios and operate at somewhat higher plasma densities. There are several types of instabilities which are known to plague mirror type confinement schemes. These instabilities fall into two general classes. One class of instability is the Magnetohdrodynamic or MHD instability which induces gross distortions in the plasma geometry. The other class of instability is the "loss cone" <b>microinstability</b> which leads to general plasma turbulence. The "loss cone" <b>microinstability</b> is caused by velocity space asymmetries resulting from the loss of plasma having constituent particle velocities within the angle of the magnetic mirror "loss cone.

40|$|A full {{particle}} simulation {{study is}} carried out for studying <b>microinstabilities</b> generated at the shock front of perpendicular collisionless shocks. The structure and dynamics of shock waves are determined by Alfven Mach number and plasma beta, while <b>microinstabilities</b> are controlled by {{the ratio of the}} upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity and the plasma-to-cyclotron frequency.

40|$|We {{present a}} number of 3 D kinetic PIC {{simulations}} aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind the onset of magnetic reconnection [1]. Traditionally, the reigning paradigm has been that <b>microinstabilities</b> lead to anomalous resistivity and allow reconnection to progress even in collisionless systems where under ideal conditions reconnection would be severely impeded. Our work aims at revisiting this issue using the 3 D kinetic simulation tool, CELESTE. CELESTE uses an implicit time discretization of the particle equations of motion and of the Maxwell's equations allowing to resolve the scales of interest, while averaging over the smallest scales. To understand reconnection processes we need to resolve the skin depth and the particle motion in the reconnection region, but we can step over the smaller scales (Debye length, and electron plasma frequency). The overall advantage is a reduction {{of at least one}} order of magnitude in the number of cells in each direction, and one order in time. Our analysis shows that the <b>microinstabilities</b> alter the initial equilibrium at a fundamental level. Besides creating a small scale turbulent fluctuating magnetic and electric field, the <b>microinstabilities</b> induce a macroscopic alteration of the equilibrium. Three macroscopic changes are induced. First, an anisotropic heating creates a strong temperature anisotropy enhancing the cross field temperature [2]. Second, the current layer is intensified and its profile is peaked and in cases bifurcated [2, 3, 4]. Third, a velocity shear is created [5, 6]. Each of these three effects impact profoundly the onset and evolution of reconnection. We present specific results proving the three effects and their role in the reconnection process. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Two sets of {{experiments}} and observations suggest {{that an important}} factor in the coupling of <b>microinstabilities</b> with large scale processes is momentum transport. In astrophysical systems, there is mounting evidence that microinstabilites can lead to large-scale plasma flows. In the Earth’s magnetotail, satellite observations have shown microinstabilites driven by pressure gradients at the edge of plasma sheet [1]. We have predicted that such instabilities can lead to momentum transport that penetrates into the current layer and lead to velocity shears on macroscopic scales [2]. In laboratory experiments, for example on Alcator C-Mod, researchers have shown that toroidal angular momentum is generated spontaneously in the plasma edge and propagates inward [3]. The analogy with the space observations is striking as in both cases the <b>microinstabilities</b> develop in the edge of the plasma but momentum propagates inward and angular momentum is generated in the toroidal direction (dawn-dusk direction). Also, {{at least some of the}} theories [4] assume that the microinstabilites are due to pressure gradients in both cases.

The alpha particles {{are considered to}} be passive, thus not modifying the fine structure of the turbulence, and modelled as Maxwellian distributed. Both the turbulent fields and the evolution of the alpha distribution are computed by means of an Eulerian, flux tube code. It is shown how significant transport of high pressure distributions can occur, and how the direction and the intensity of the particle flux is sensitive to the choice of the temperature scale length of the alpha distribution, due to thermodiffusive phenomena. The diffusivity of an ITER-like case is studied, starting from an analytical treatment of the density and temperature profiles, which we show to be significant.

It is found that solitons or strong Langmuir turbulence are likely to occur in the diffusion region under solar flare conditions in which the electric resistivity could be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in the region, resulting in significant heating and stochastic acceleration of particles. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the transition of the magnetic field velocity and plasma density from the outer MHD region into the diffusive region and then back out again with the completion of the energy conversion process.

40|$|Compressive {{fluctuations}} are a minor yet significant {{component of}} astrophysical plasma turbulence. In the solar wind, long-wavelength compressive slow-mode fluctuations lead {{to changes in}} $\beta_{\parallel \mathrm p}\equiv 8 \pi n_{\mathrm p}k_{\mathrm B}T_{\parallel \mathrm p}/B^ 2 $ and in $R_{\mathrm p}\equiv T_{\perp \mathrm p}/T_{\parallel \mathrm p}$, where $T_{\perp \mathrm p}$ and $T_{\parallel \mathrm p}$ are the perpendicular and parallel temperatures of the protons, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $n_{\mathrm p}$ is the proton density. If the amplitude of the compressive fluctuations is large enough, $R_{\mathrm p}$ crosses one or more instability thresholds for anisotropy-driven <b>microinstabilities.</b> The enhanced field fluctuations from these <b>microinstabilities</b> scatter the protons so as to reduce the anisotropy of the pressure tensor. We propose that this scattering drives the average value of $R_{\mathrm p}$ away from the marginal stability boundary until the fluctuating value of $R_{\mathrm p}$ stops crossing the boundary. We model this "fluctuating-anisotropy effect" using linear Vlasov [...] Maxwell theory to describe the large-scale compressive fluctuations.

Here, modified two-stream instability MTSI is assumed to become dominant in low Mach number regime, while Buneman instability BI is assumed to become dominant in high Mach number regime. It is revealed that Mach number dependence of the effective electron temperature in the MTSI dominant case is essentially different from that in the BI dominant case. The effective electron temperature through the MTSI does not depend much on the Mach number, although that through the BI increases with the Mach number as in the past studies. The results are confirmed to be consistent with the PIC simulations both in qualitative and quantitative levels.
