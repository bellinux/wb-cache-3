Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>fragment.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 1990s that {{rational}} design principles for the construction of two-photon-absorbing <b>molecules</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be developed, in response to a need from imaging and data storage technologies, and aided by the rapid increases in computer power that allowed quantum calculations to be made. The accurate quantum mechanical analysis of two-photon absorbance is orders of magnitude more computationally intensive than that of one-photon absorbance, requiring highly correlated calculations at very high levels of theory.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, psychedelia <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{fall out of}} fashion and those folk groups that had not already moved into {{different}} areas had largely disbanded.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture that Stallman thrived on <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fragment.</b> <b>To</b> prevent {{software}} from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution.

25|$|Throughout this reign, {{continued}} revolts by Byzantine Sicilians happened, {{especially in}} the east, {{and part of the}} lands were even re-occupied before being quashed. Agricultural items, such as oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugar cane, were brought to Sicily, the native Christians were allowed nominal freedom of religion with jaziya (tax on non-Muslims, imposed by Muslim rulers) to their rulers for the right to practise their own religion privately.

50|$|Economic {{anthropology}} as {{influenced by}} Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics {{to take account}} of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study.
