500|$|Final Fantasy X-2 (2003), was {{the first}} direct video game sequel to any Final Fantasy game. Despite having {{composed}} {{the majority of the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy X, Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project. No tracks from X or other games in the series were used in the game. In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles, Square brought Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi on board to compose the music for X-2, as the developers felt they were the [...] "perfect fit" [...] to incorporate a [...] "pop" [...] style into the music. The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the J-Pop song [...] "real Emotion", was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, J-Pop ballad [...] "1000 Words", was written by scenario writers Kazushige Nojima and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by Jade Villalon from Sweetbox in the English version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album Adagio. In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by Kumi Koda and were released as a single entitled real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single Come with Me, with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade.

The steps which have been taken by the Exploration Team are motivated by the need to reduce the mass of the payload delivery flights, as well as the overall mission cost, without introducing additional mission risk. By eliminating the need for a large heavy-lift launch vehicle and deleting the redundant habitat delivery flight in Version 3.0 , two launches from the Earth were eliminated. The net result is a current Version 3.0 Reference Mission which requires an injected mass of approximately one-half that of the 1993/94 Reference Mission." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the computation of a geoid {{model for the}} Amazon Basin (GEOAMA) limited by 5 ºN and 10 ºS in latitude and 70 ºW and 50 ºW in longitude. The software package SHGEO developed by the University of New Brunswick, Canada, {{was used for the}} calculation. The geoid model was derived by using the following data: digital terrain model SRTM 3 (Shuttle Recovery Topography <b>Mission)</b> <b>version</b> 2. 0 with 3 " grid, the geopotential model EIGEN-GL 04 S 1, degree and order 150, derived from GRACE satellite, and terrestrial gravity data basically observed along the rivers. For GEOAMA validation the longitudinal profiles of some rivers over the basin derived from three geoid models (EGM 96, MAPGEO 2004 and EIGEN-GL 04 C) combined with geodetic heights from 28 GPS stations close to the tide gage stations were used. The results show that GEOAMA is in good agreement with the EGM 96, MAPGEO 2004 and EIGEN-GL 04 C profiles and with the average of the main rivers (Solimões and Amazonas) gradient (20 mm/km).

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{comparison}} and {{validation of the}} Shuttle Radar Topography <b>Mission</b> <b>Version</b> 3. 0 Global 1 Arc-Second (SRTMGL 1) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (ASTER GDEM 2) applied to two areas of Maghreb region (Biskra, Algeria and Medenine, Tunisia). These are the two target areas assessed {{in the frame of}} WADIS-MAR project ([URL] {{which is one of the}} five demonstration projects implemented within the Regional Programme SWIM ([URL] and funded by the European Commission. Newly released SRTMGL 1 is available for free download since October 2014 over the African continent through United States Geological Survey (USGS) web data tools. Given the previously reported issues regarding optical sources DEMs, SRTMGL 1 can provide significant advantages in elevation modelling and geoscience applications, but studies regarding its quality assessment and validation are in their early infancy. We employed the two data sets in a visual and quantitative comparison and subsequently, their validation was conducted using ground control points (GCPs) collected within the target areas. Results show that SRTMGL 1 presents an overall major accuracy and higher sensitivity to small-scale features and slight variations in landforms...|$|E
40|$|Central {{equatorial}} Africa is {{deficient in}} long-term, ground-based measurements of rainfall; therefore, {{the aim of}} this study is to assess the accuracy of three high-resolution, satellite-based rainfall products in western Uganda for the 2001 – 10 period. The three products are African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC 2); African Rainfall Estimation Algorithm, version 2 (RFE 2); and 3 B 42 from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring <b>Mission,</b> <b>version</b> 7 (i. e., 3 B 42 v 7). Daily rainfall totals from six gauges were used to assess the accuracy of satellite-based rainfall estimates of rainfall days, daily rainfall totals, 10 -day rainfall totals, monthly rainfall totals, and seasonal rainfall totals. The northern stations had a mean annual rainfall total of 1390 mm, while the southern stations had a mean annual rainfall total of 900 mm. 3 B 42 v 7 was the only product that did not underestimate boreal-summer rainfall at the northern stations, which had ~ 3 times as much rainfall during boreal summer than did the southern stations. The three products tended to overestimate rainfall days at all stations and were borderline satisfactory at identifying rainfall days at the northern stations; the products did not perform satisfactorily at the southern stations. At the northern stations, 3 B 42 v 7 performed satisfactorily at estimating monthly and seasonal rainfall totals, ARC 2 was only satisfactory at estimating seasonal rainfall totals, and RFE 2 did not perform satisfactorily at any time step. The satellite products performed worst at the two stations located in rain shadows, and 3 B 42 v 7 had substantial overestimates at those stations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{burden of}} malaria has {{decreased}} dramatically {{within the past}} several years in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Further malaria control will require targeted control strategies based on evidence of risk. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify environmental risk factors for malaria transmission using remote sensing technologies to guide malaria control interventions in a region of declining burden of malaria. Methods Satellite images were used to construct a sampling frame for the random selection of households enrolled in prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys of malaria parasitaemia in Southern Province, Zambia. A digital elevation model (DEM) was derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography <b>Mission</b> <b>version</b> 3 DEM and used for landscape characterization, including landforms, elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness, topographic position index and hydrological models of stream networks. Results A total of 768 individuals from 128 randomly selected households were enrolled over 21 months, from the end of the rainy season in April 2007 through December 2008. Of the 768 individuals tested, 117 (15. 2 %) were positive by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Individuals residing within 3. 75 km of a third order stream were at increased risk of malaria. Households at elevations above the baseline elevation for the region were at decreasing risk of having RDT-positive residents. Households where new infections occurred were overlaid on a risk map of RDT positive households and incident infections were more likely to be located in high-risk areas derived from prevalence data. Based on the spatial risk map, targeting households in the top 80 th percentile of malaria risk would require malaria control interventions directed to only 24 % of the households. Conclusions Remote sensing technologies can be used to target malaria control interventions in a region of declining malaria transmission in southern Zambia, enabling a more efficient use of resources for malaria elimination. </p...|$|E
