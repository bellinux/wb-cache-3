5000|$|In January 2014, Novartis {{announced}} plans to cut 500 jobs from its pharmaceuticals division. In February 2014, Novartis announced that it has acquired CoStim Pharmaceuticals. In May 2014, Novartis bought the rights to market Ophthotech's Fovista (an anti-PDGF aptamer, also being investigated for use in combination with anti-VEGF treatments) outside the United States for up to $1 billion. [...] Novartis will acquire exclusive rights to market the eye <b>drug</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>America</b> whilst retaining US marketing rights. The company agreed to pay Ophthotech $200 million upfront, and $130 million in milestone payments relating to Phase III trials. Ophthotech is also eligible to receive up to $300 million dependent upon future marketing approval milestones outside <b>of</b> <b>America</b> and up to $400 million relating to sales milestones. In September 2014, Ophthotech received its first $50 million phase III trial milestone payment from Novartis.

In August 2014 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News reported that Novartis had acquired a 15% stake in Gamida Cell for $35 million, with the option to purchase the whole company for approximately $165 million.

50|$|In 2014, {{a pair of}} {{researchers}} published a literature review in Journal of Studies on Alcohol and <b>Drugs</b> <b>of</b> studies {{on the effect of}} the drinking age in response to the Amethyst Initiative; the review indicates support for the drinking age remaining at 21. That review, however, was specific to studies focused on the United States <b>of</b> <b>America</b> and comparing trends before and after 1984; based on World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2011 and 2014, foreign countries with lesser drinking ages often have fewer alcohol-related deaths per capita annually than the USA.|$|R

25|$|Little {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the degree that benzodiazepines are abused as a primary <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> choice, but they are frequently abused alongside other <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse, especially alcohol, stimulants and opiates. The benzodiazepine most commonly abused can vary from country to country and depends on factors including local popularity as well as which benzodiazepines are available. Nitrazepam for example is commonly abused in Nepal and the United Kingdom, whereas in the United States <b>of</b> <b>America</b> where nitrazepam is not available on prescription other benzodiazepines are more commonly abused. In the United Kingdom and Australia there have been epidemics of temazepam abuse. Particular problems with abuse of temazepam are often related to gel capsules being melted and injected and drug-related deaths. Injecting most benzodiazepines is dangerous because of their relative insolubility in water (with the exception of midazolam), leading to potentially serious adverse health consequences for users.|$|R

40|$|Penicillin {{has been}} the {{recommended}} <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> choice in most cases of group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis for nearly 40 years based on its efficacy {{in the prevention of}} acute rheumatic fever. Since trials <b>of</b> other <b>drugs</b> for the prevention of rheumatic fever are no longer feasible in the United States, eradication of GAS pharyngitis has become the surrogate for their evaluation. On the basis of this criterion, specific therapeutic regimens have been recommended, and numerous other drugs have gained approval as alternatives to penicillin. Current therapeutic issues include possible decreased efficacy of penicillin, timing of the initiation <b>of</b> therapy, and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> choice for patients whose treatment fails, who are chronic carriers, or who have frequent infections. Criteria for assessment <b>of</b> new <b>drugs</b> include clinical response, likelihood of prevention of rheu-matic fever, rates of relapse and recurrent infection, and drug safety. The establishment of uni-form guidelines and definitions of response for new drug evaluations by the Infectious Diseases Society <b>of</b> <b>America</b> should aid in the further assessment of new antibacterial agents as therapy for GAS pharyngitis. However, no data yet suggest that any <b>of</b> these <b>drugs</b> should replace penicillin as the <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> choice. Streptococcal pharyngitis {{is one of the most}} common bac...|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, Lundborg's {{latest and}} largest writing project was {{launched}} {{with the publication}} of Psychedelia - An Ancient Culture, A Modern Way Of Life (Lysergia 25-12, [...] ). Unlike Lundborg's earlier works, the Psychedelia book is expanded to cover a much wider field than music. Psychedelic culture is traced from its beginnings with the hallucinogenic celebrations at Eleusis 2500 years ago, acknowledging in parallel the ancient shamanic plant <b>drug</b> cultures <b>of</b> South <b>America</b> and Mexico. A permanent alternative spiritual culture of the West is outlined as Lundborg follows the impulse from Eleusis through the Neoplatonism and pantheism of the Middle Ages, the rise of hermeticism and esoteric alchemy during the Renaissance, up to the highly visible psychedelic scenes of the modern world. Certain representative works and artists are selected for detailed analysis, such as William Shakespeare's The Tempest, Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now, William Blake, Eden Ahbez, the 13th Floor Elevators, the Mel Lyman Family, Terence McKenna, Grateful Dead, Philip K Dick, Father Yod & The Source Family, and several more. Broader cultural developments given close scrutiny include the ayahuasca religions of Amazonia, the rich hallucinogenic culture of the Aztec, the 1960s Haight-Ashbury scene, the 1970s interest in homegrowing psilocybin mushrooms, the Electronic Dance Music scenes of acid house, Goa PsyTrance and Psybient, and several more.|$|R
