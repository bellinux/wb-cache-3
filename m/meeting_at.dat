5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
