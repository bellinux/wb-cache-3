5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> during intense physical activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> can be central, neuromuscular, or {{peripheral}} muscular. Central <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> manifests as {{an overall}} sense of energy deprivation, and peripheral muscle weakness manifests as a local, muscle-specific inability to do work. Neuromuscular fatigue {{can be either}} central or peripheral.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> during {{physical}} work is an inability {{for the body}} to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This {{is the most common}} case of physical fatigue—affecting a national average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal aerobic metabolism, generally results in the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue,</b> though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this {{cross-sectional}} single-blind {{study was to investigate}} the immediate effects of Kinesiology taping of quadriceps on motor performance after <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigued</b> induction. Design. Randomized controlled cross-sectional design. Subjects. Forty-five subjects participated in this study. Participants were divided into three groups: Kinesiology taping group, placebo taping group, and nontaping group. Methods. Subjects performed short-term exercise for <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigued</b> induction, followed by the application of each intervention. Peak torque test, one-leg single hop test, active joint position sense test, and one-leg static balance test were carried out before and after the intervention. Results. Peak torque and single-leg hopping distance were significantly increased when Kinesiology taping was applied (p< 0. 05). But there were no significant effects on active joint position sense and single-leg static balance. Conclusions. We proved that Kinesiology taping is effective in restoring muscle power reduced after <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigued</b> induction. Therefore, we suggest that Kinesiology taping is beneficial for <b>fatigued</b> <b>muscles...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} focused {{on the effects of}} trunk {{extensor}} <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> on postural control during quiet standing under different somatosensory conditions from the foot and the ankle. With this aim, 20 young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of trunk extensor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was degraded by standing on a foam surface. In Experiment 2 (n = 10), somatosensation from the foot and ankle was facilitated through the increased cutaneous feedback at the foot and ankle provided by strips of athletic tape applied across both ankle joints. The centre of foot pressure displacements (CoP) were recorded using a force platform. The results showed that (1) trunk extensor <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> increased CoP displacements under normal somatosensatory conditions (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) this destabilizing effect was exacerbated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was degraded (Experiment 1), and (3) this destabilizing effect was mitigated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was facilitated (Experiment 2). Altogether, the present findings evidenced re-weighting of sensory cues for controlling posture during quiet standing following trunk extensor <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> by increasing the reliance on the somatosensory inputs from the foot and the ankle. This could have implications in clinical and rehabilitative areas...|$|R
50|$|Good form {{ensures that}} the {{movement}} only uses the main muscles, and avoids recruiting secondary muscles. As a <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigues,</b> the body attempts to compensate by recruiting other muscle groups and transferring force generation to non-fatigued units.

25|$|Muscle cells work by {{detecting}} a flow {{of electrical}} impulses from the brain, which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell. This makes less calcium available for the muscle cell. In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.|$|E
25|$|Afferent {{signals are}} sensory {{neuronal}} signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise {{from a large}} number of sources including the carotid bodies, medulla, lungs, and chest wall. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O2, CO2 and H+. In the lungs, juxtacapillary (J) receptors are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema, while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. Muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leading to hypercapnia, left heart failure leading to interstitial edema (impairing gas exchange), asthma causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this human}} study, {{the effect of}} slopes changes of motion surface on four <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> of lower limb was {{investigated}} by surface electromyography. Zero, 10 and 20 degree slopes of a treadmill with constant speed of 5 km/h were used. Seven mature men were selected. Each man as walked on the treadmill at each slope for five minutes time. Then, muscles signals were recorded before and after walking on treadmill by surface electromyography. Time period of between tests for each person on different slopes of treadmill was 48 hours. It was revealed that between <b>fatigue</b> rate of <b>muscles,</b> at zero degree slope, was not significantly different (P> 0. 05). But, at 10 degree slope, between fatigue rate of Tibialis and others was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and was increased. Also, at 20 degree slope, between fatigue rate of Quadriceps and others was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and was increased too.

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between the peripheral and central theories of <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> is that the peripheral model of <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> assumes failure at one or more sites in the chain that initiates muscle contraction. Peripheral regulation [...] therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve {{the integrity of the}} system by initiating <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore, the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend {{on the nature of the}} fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of a tongue-placed electrotactile biofeedback system to improve ankle force sense following plantar-flexor <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue,</b> 11 young healthy adults were asked to perform an isometric contra-lateral force ankle-matching task in two experimental conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the plantar-flexor muscles and two conditions of No biofeedback and Biofeedback. The underlying principle of the biofeedback consisted of supplying subjects with supplementary information about the force developed by the plantar-flexor muscles through electrical stimulation of the tongue. Measures of the overall accuracy and the variability of the force ankle-matching performances were determined using the absolute error and the variable error, respectively. Results showed that (1) the Fatigue condition yielded increased absolute and variable errors relative to the No fatigue condition in the No biofeedback condition, whereas (2) {{no significant difference between the}} two No fatigue and Fatigue conditions was observed in the Biofeedback condition. These results suggest that subjects were able to integrate augmented sensory information delivered through electrotactile stimulation of the tongue to suppress the adverse effect of plantar-flexor <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> on ankle force sense.

2500|$|Physical fatigue, or <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue,</b> is the {{temporary}} physical inability of a muscle to perform optimally. The onset of <b>muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> during physical activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's level of physical fitness, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. It can be reversed by rest. Physical fatigue {{can be caused}} by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a reduction of the drive originating from the central nervous system. The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system. [...] During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction. During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Muscle</b> <b>fatigue</b> is the neuromuscular {{adaptation}} to challenges {{over a period}} of time. [...] The use of motor units {{over a period of}} time can result in changes in the motor command from the brain.

[...] Recruitment of motor units varies from muscle to muscle depending on the upper limit of motor recruitment in the muscle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate whether, with vision, the magnitude of the effect of calf <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> on postural control during bipedal quiet standing depends on the eye-visual target distance. Twelve young university students were asked to stand upright as immobile as possible in three visual conditions (No vision, Vision 1 m and Vision 4 m) executed in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the calf muscles. Centre of foot pressure displacements were recorded using a force platform. Similar increased variances of the centre of foot pressure displacements were observed in the fatigue relative to the No fatigue condition for both the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions. Interestingly, in the vision 1 m condition, fatigue yielded: (1) a similar increased variance of the centre of foot pressure displacements to those observed in the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the medio-lateral axis and (2) a weaker destabilising effect relative to the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the antero-posterior axis. These results evidence that the ability to use visual information for postural control during bipedal quiet standing following calf <b>muscles</b> <b>fatigue</b> is dependent on the eye-visual target distance. More largely, {{in the context of the}} multisensory control of balance, the present findings suggest that the efficiency of the sensory reweighting of visual sensory cues as the neuro-muscular constraints acting on the subject change is critically linked with the quality of the information the visual system obtains...|$|R
