40|$|ABSTRACT Ten <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 10 females {{from each}} of five {{commercial}} broiler strains were weighed and slaughtered at 55 days of age. Over all, mean live body weight was 2112 g for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 1702 g for females and abdominal fat was 2. 9 % (<b>males)</b> <b>and</b> 3. 3 % (females). Mean total fat in whole bird was 13. 4 % (<b>males)</b> <b>and</b> 15. 1 % (females). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between strains at the 5 % level. Correlation coefficients with percent abdominal fat were. 29 for body weight (<b>males)</b> <b>and.</b> 36 (females), for percent carcass fat. 51 (<b>males)</b> <b>and.</b> 77 (females), and for fat free carcass. 26 (<b>males)</b> <b>and.</b> 07 (females).

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself <b>male</b> <b>and</b> began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E

5|$|Both the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks.
