In order to ensure the accuracy of <b>moisture</b> <b>meters,</b> the measurement uncertainty for two designs of meters, the farm-type sample-cell (CD-S) and inspection-type single-grain (CTR-E 200) were evaluated in this study. The standard moisture content of rough rice was maintained using reference materials. The source of uncertainty included the predicted values of calibration equation, the source of reference materials, the effects of temperature variation, nonlinear and repeatability and resolution source. The study also dealt with the effect of calibration equations on uncertainty. The uncertainty analysis showed that predicted uncertainty is the main source for combined uncertainty.

Some of the more sophisticated analyzers use prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) or pulsed fast thermal neutron activation (PFTNA) to determine the elemental content of the coal.

Moisture meters are often found {{in conjunction with the}} elemental analyzers, but sometimes are used alone, or in conjunction with ash gauges. Most moisture meters use microwave technology.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{three sections}} of work. The {{first section of}} this work is principally aimed at producing resistance and capacitance type meter species correction data for a commercially popular species of Tasmanian Eaucalypt, Eaucalyptus delegatensis. The resistance type meter correction data obtained deviate from those values given in the Australian Standard. Differences in resistance meter electrode placement {{are assumed to be}} the cause of the deviations. Regression trendlines obtained for the capacitance-type <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> were shown to have a lesser degree of accuracy than those for the resistance-type <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> due to the effects of density. The practice of measuring the average moisture content at a depth of 115 th of the thickness of a board using insulated probes in conjunction with resistance-type <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> was reinforced. The second part of this project involved work on a solar kiln situated at Kelly's Timber - Dunally. The purpose of the work was to try and improve the drying efficiency of the kiln and monitor it's progress throughout the drying process. Three drying trials were performed. A full schedule was provided for one of the trials where green sawn timber was fully dried to EMC. The success of the schedule was tainted by the poor quality of the timber before the drying process began. Air flow was improved throughout the kiln by the use of appropriate baffling and racking of the timber as recommended by the author. The temperature distribution and humidity control inside the kiln was found to be satisfactory. The final section of this research involved improving the drying efficiency of three Tasmanian industrial timber drying kilns.

It {{should be noted that}} the moisture meters must be used correctly, and the calibration equation for the microwave <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> was obtained preliminarily as a function of microwave attenuation, moisture content and density in accordance with the manual of the manufacturer. First, meter readings were taken from the middle of the boards by setting the density value to the mean measured density of 355  kg/m 3. Second, meter readings were taken again by setting the density value to the NIR-predicted value obtained from the end surface of each board. Thereafter, the boards were oven-dried and their MC was calculated gravimetrically. Twelve boards had oven-dry MC above 30  % and were considered as “wet”. Therefore, the wet boards were eliminated and the remaining 108 boards were used for MC evaluation.|$|E
30|$|Inspection of the {{moisture}} content (MC) in dried lumber {{is essential for}} wood industry to ensure dimensional stability in service. Several types of commercial moisture meters authorized by Japan Housing and Wood Technology Center (HOWTEC) (e.g. resistance-type, capacitance-type, microwave and neutron moisture meters) {{have been used to}} check MC of lumber in sawmills. These moisture meters are designed to perform a calibration based on wood density, because density has a significant influence on MC readings obtained with these moisture meters [1]. For instance, Milota [2] used a capacitance-type <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> to measure MC of samples of eight species conditioned sequentially at 22, 18, 12 and 8  % equilibrium MC, and demonstrated that the performance of the <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> could be improved by density calibration. Using a permeable neutron <b>moisture</b> <b>meter,</b> Moriya et al. [3] recently examined the effect of density on thermal neutron by which the MC of lumber is measured, and concluded that density calibration is critical for MC measurement with high accuracy. It is, however, difficult to measure the density of each lumber in sawmills, because density determination is traditionally done by a volumetric method that is accurate but destructive and time consuming. As a consequence, a commercial <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> is calibrated approximately by setting known, constant density values to each species, resulting in an error in MC reading. Thus, a method for swiftly and non-destructively measuring the density of lumber is being required.|$|E
