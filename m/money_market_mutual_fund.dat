40|$|In {{the wake}} of the events of September 2008, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have made {{significant}} changes to the way they invest. Those changes have been driven by business and investment needs as well as by substantial revisions to the regulatory framework in which funds operate. Yet, some policymakers and market participants are calling for additional regulatory or legislative action. This paper lays out the important role that <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> play in the short-term capital markets, traces the successful regulatory history of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and argues that suggested reforms would create, rather than reduce, systemic risk...|$|R

2500|$|The first <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> {{to break}} the buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. [...] An {{argument}} has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as {{at the time of}} liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. [...] However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest [...] "solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations." [...] Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2-a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. [...] Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. [...] In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund [...] "breaking the buck".|$|E

40|$|Traditional banking {{theory has}} always viewed banks as {{financial}} intermediaries. Technological developments and regulatory changes have {{given rise to}} different types of non-bank financial intermediaries. Researchers have made claims about banks losing importance due to the emergence of non-bank financial intermediaries. As a non-bank financial intermediary, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have experienced phenomenal growth in Europe and the United States over the years. This growth has also been evident in South Africa in the past ten years. Several researchers have investigated the alleged disintermediation of banks’ traditional deposit taking in favour of investment management activities like managed funds. These researchers have found different levels of existence of such disintermediation in the different countries wherein the research was conducted. None of the research known to the author has provided empirical evidence of or refuted the allegation that the traditional deposit taking role of banks is declining and that <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> are substitutes for banks’ deposits. Moreover, such research has not been conducted in South Africa. Using banks’ deposits data and the net assets of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> reported at the South African Reserve Bank, this thesis uses regression techniques to provide evidence for the substitutability of banks’ deposits by <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> This substitution exists more in long-term deposit and short-term deposit products. The regression models derived in this thesis are found to be stable enough to be used for forecasting total bank deposits. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Recent reform {{proposals}} {{call for an}} elimination of the constant net asset value (NAV) or buck in <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> to reduce the occurrence of runs. Outside the United States, there are several countries that have <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> with and without constant NAVs. Using daily data on individual fund flows from these countries, this paper evaluates whether the reliance on a constant NAV {{is associated with a}} higher frequency of sustained fund outflows. Preliminary evidence suggests that funds with a constant NAV are more likely to experience sustained outflows, even after controlling for country fixed effects and other factors. Moreover, these sustained outflows in constant NAV <b>money</b> <b>market</b> funds were more acute during the period of the run on the Reserve Primary fund, and were subdued after the U. S. Treasury guarantee program for <b>money</b> <b>market</b> funds was put in place. Consistent with the theory that constant NAV funds receive additional implicit support from fund sponsors, fund liquidations are less prevalent in funds with a constant NAV following periods of larger outflows...|$|R

50|$|The Bankers is the 1975 book by the economist-writer Martin Mayer that {{describes}} the industry just at the cusp of deregulation.

40|$|Large {{banks and}} dealers use and reuse {{collateral}} pledged by nonbanks, which helps lubricate {{the global financial}} system. The supply of collateral arises from specific investment strategies in the asset management complex, with the primary providers being hedge funds, pension funds, insurers, official sector accounts, <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> and others. Post-Lehman, {{there has been a}} significant decline in the source collateral for the large dealers that specialize in intermediating pledgeable collateral. Since collateral can be reused, the overall effect (i. e., reduced ?source'' of collateral times the velocity of collateral) may have been a $ 4 - 5 trillion reduction in collateral. This decline in financial lubrication likely has impact on the conduct of global monetary policy. And recent regulations aimed at financial stability, focusing on building equity and reducing leverage at large banks/dealers, may also reduce financial lubrication in the nonbank/bank nexus.
