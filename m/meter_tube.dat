40|$|The Coriolis {{principle}} for measuring flow rates has great advantages {{compared to other}} flow measurement principles, the most important being that mass flow is measured directly. Up to now the measurement of low flow rates posed a great challenge.

Innovations included shape and fixation of the <b>meter</b> <b>tube,</b> contactless (pure torque) actuation of the tube oscillation and contactless sensing of Coriolis force-induced displacements.

40|$|NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is {{currently}} implementing a reconfigurable polarimetric L-band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR), specifically designed to acquire airborne repeat track interferometric (RTI) SAR data, also know as differential interferometric measurements. Differential interferometry can provide key displacement measurements, important for the scientific studies of Earthquakes and volcanoes. Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system {{will be able to}} fly predefined paths with great precision. The radar will be designed to operate on a UAV (Unmanned Arial Vehicle) but will initially be demonstrated on a minimally piloted vehicle (MPV), such as the Proteus build by Scaled Composites. The application requires control of the flight path to within a 10 <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> to support repeat track and formation flying measurements. The design is fully polarimetric with an 80 MHz bandwidth (2 meter range resolution) and 16 kilometer range swath. The antenna is an electronically steered array to assure that the actual antenna pointing can be controlled independent of the wind direction and speed. The system will nominally operate at 45, 000 ft. The program started out as a Instrument Incubator Project (IIP) funded by NASA Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO) ...|$|E

40|$|The NASA Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) {{program is}} {{developing}} a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for ground measurements. A key element {{for the success of}} this program is a Platform Precision Autopilot (PPA). An interim vehicle (NASA C- 20 AJGlll) was selected to carry the radar pod and develop the PPA. The PPA interfaces with the C- 20 AIG Ill aircraft by imitating the output of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. This technique retains the safeguards in the aircraft's autopilot. The PPA entered initial flight testing in early 2007. The PPA uses a Kalman filter to generate a real-time position solution with information from the C- 20 AIGIII and a real-time differential GPS unit designed by JPL. The real-time navigation solution is used to compute commands (Guidance and Control subsystems) which in turn drive two modified ILS testers. The ILS tester units produce modulated RF signals fed to the onboard navigation receiver. These correction signals allow the C- 20 NGIII autopilot to fly a simulated ILS approach that meets the PPA requirements for UAVSAR applications. The PPA requirement is to make repeat pass flights within a ten <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> over a 200 kilometer course in conditions of cairn to light turbulence.

40|$|Hyperloop {{is a new}} mode of {{transportation}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} California's high speed rail project, with the intended benefits of higher performance at lower overall costs. It consists of a passenger pod traveling through a tube under a light vacuum and suspended on air bearings. The pod travels up to transonic speeds resulting in a 35 minute travel time between the intended route from Los Angeles and San Francisco. Of the two variants outlined, the smaller system includes a 1. 1 meter tall passenger capsule traveling through a 2. 2 <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> at 700 miles per hour. The passenger pod features water-based heat exchangers as well as an on-board compression system that reduces the aerodynamic drag as it moves through the tube. Although the original proposal looks very promising, it assumes that tube and pod dimensions are independently sizable without fully acknowledging the constraints of the compressor system on the pod geometry. This work focuses on the aerodynamic and thermodynamic interactions between the two largest systems; the tube and the pod. Using open-source toolsets, a new sizing method is developed based on one-dimensional thermodynamic relationships that accounts for the strong interactions between these sub-systems. These additional considerations require a tube nearly twice the size originally considered and limit the maximum pod travel speed to about 620 miles per hour. Although the results indicate that Hyperloop will need to be larger and slightly slower than originally intended, the estimated travel time only increases by approximately five minutes, so the overall performance is not dramatically affected. In addition, the proposed on-board heat exchanger is not an ideal solution to achieve reasonable equilibrium air temperatures within the tube. Removal of this subsystem represents a potential reduction in weight, energy requirements and complexity of the pod. In light of these finding, the core concept still remains a compelling possibility, although additional engineering and economic analyses are markedly necessary before a more complete design can be developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} and quick measurement of small mass flow rates (~ 10 mg/s) of fluids {{is considered an}} “enabling technology��? in semiconductor, fine-chemical, and food & drugs industries. Flowmeters based on the Coriolis effect offer the most direct sensing of the mass flow rate, {{and for this reason}} do not need complicated translation or linearization tables to compensate for other physical parameters (e. g. density, state, temperature, heat capacity, viscosity, etc.) of the medium that they measure. This also makes Coriolis meters versatile – the same instrument can, without need for factory calibration, measure diverse fluid media – liquids as well as gases. Additionally, Coriolis meters have a quick response, and can principally afford an all-metal-no-sliding-parts fluid interface. A Coriolis force is a pseudo-force that is generated when a mass is forced to travel along a straight path in a rotating system. This is apparent in a hurricane on the earth (a rotating system) where, when air flows towards a low-pressure region from surrounding areas, instead of following a straight path it “swirls��? (in a {towards + sideways} motion). The sideways motion component of the swirl may be attributed to the Coriolis (pseudo) force. To harness this force for the purpose of measurement, a rotating tube may be used. The measurand (mass flow rate) is forced through this tube. The Coriolis force will then be observed as a sideways force (counteracting the swirl) acting upon this tube in presence of mass-flows. The Coriolis mass flow <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> may thus be viewed as an active measurement – a “modulator��? where the output (Coriolis force) is proportional to the product of the excitation (angular velocity of the tube) and the measurand (mass flow rate). From a constructional viewpoint, the Coriolis force in a Coriolis meter is generated in an oscillating (rather than a continuously rotating) meter-tube that carries the measurand fluid. In such a system (typically oscillating at a chosen eigenfrequency of the tube-construction), besides the Coriolis force, there are also inertial, dissipative and spring-forces that act upon the <b>meter</b> <b>tube.</b> As the instrument is scaled down, these other forces become significantly larger than the generated Coriolis force. Several “tricks��? can be implemented to isolate these constructional forces from the Coriolis force, based on orthogonality – in the time domain, in eigenmodes and in terms of position (unobservable & uncontrollable modes, symmetry, etc.). Being an active measurement, the design of Coriolis flowmeters involves multidisciplinary elements - fluid dynamics, fine-mechanical construction principles, mechanical design of the oscillating tube and surroundings, sensor and actuator design, electronics for driving, sensing and processing and software for data manipulation & control. This nature lends itself well to a mechatronic system-design approach. Such an approach, combined with a “V-model��? system development cycle, aids in the realization of a Coriolis meter for low flows. Novel concepts and proven design principles are assessed and consciously chosen for implementation for this “active measurement��?. These include: - shape and form of the meter-tube - a statically determined affixation of the tube - contactless pure-torque actuator for exciting the tube - contactless position-sensing for observing the (effect of) Coriolis force - strategic positioning of the sensor & actuator to minimize actuator crosstalk and to maximize the position sensor ratio-gain - ratiometric measurement of the (effect of) the Coriolis force to identify the measurand (i. e. the mass flow rate) - multi-sensor pickoff and processing based solely on time measurement – this is tolerant to component gain mismatch and any drift thereof - measurement of temperature and correction for its effect of tube-stiffness. The combined effect of these and other choices is the realization of a fully working prototype. Such prototype devices are presented as a test case in this thesis to assess the effectiveness of these choices. A “V-model��? system-development cycle involves the critical definition of requirements at the beginning and a detailed evaluation at the end to verify that these are met. To reduce ambiguity of intent, several test methods are defined right at the beginning with this model in mind. These end-tests complete the “cycle��? – a loop that began with the concepts and with the definition of requirements. However, a V-model also entails shorter iterative cycles that help refine concepts and components during the intermediate design phases. Such “inner loops��? are also presented to illustrate design at subsystem and component levels. A Coriolis flowmeter prototype with an all-steel fluid-interface is demonstrated, that has a specified full-scale (“FS��?) mass flow rate of 200 g/h (~ 55 mg/s) of water. This instrument has a long-term zero-stability better than 0. 1 % FS and sensitivity stability better than 0. 1 %, density independence of sensitivity (within 0. 2 % for liquids), negligible temperature effect on drift & sensitivity, and a 98 % settling time of less than 0. 1 s. For higher and/or negative pressure drops, these instruments have been seen to operate from – 50 ´FS to + 50 ´FS (i. e. from – 10 kg/h to + 10 kg/h) without performance degradation – particularly important in order to tolerate flow-pulsations in dosing applications. Finally, {{the results of the present}} work are discussed, and recommendations are made for possible future research that would add to it. Two important recommendations are made - about the possibility to seek, by means of an automated optimization algorithm, an improved tube shape for sensing the flow, and about constructional improvements to make the measuring instrument more robust against external vibrations...|$|E
