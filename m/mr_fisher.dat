2500|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the expansion of}} the railway the CPR needed more space for yards and shunting. Kipp Coulee near the original station did not have enough room to expand, so the CPR moved the station one mile north. This created an ideal location for a new town.

Due to confusion between the two post offices in Stirling and New Stirling, the name was changed to Maybutt. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fisher,</b> who was the original owner and planner of the townsite, decided to rename the town after his wife, Mrs. [...] "May Butt".|$|E
