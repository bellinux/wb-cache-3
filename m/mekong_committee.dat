50|$|The {{rise of the}} Khmer Rouge made {{it obvious}} that Cambodia {{would be unable to}} {{participate}} in such an organization for the foreseeable future so in April 1977 the other three riparians agreed to the Declaration Concerning the Interim <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee,</b> which resulted in the establishment of the Interim <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> in January 1978. The weakened interim organization was only able to study large-scale projects and implement a few small-scale projects, almost exclusively in Thailand; instead the institutional role of the organization shifted largely to data collection. The 1987 Revised Indicative Basin Plan - the high-water mark of the Interim Committee’s activity - scaled back the ambition of the 1970 Plan, envisioning a cascade of smaller dams along the Mekong’s mainstream, divided into 29 projects, 26 of which were strictly national in scope. The Revised Indicative Basin Plan can also be seen as laying the groundwork for Cambodia’s readmission. Indeed, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia requested readmission in June 1991.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> {{are linked to the}} legacy of (de)colonialism in Indochina and {{subsequent}} geopolitical developments. The political, social, and economic conditions of the Mekong River basin countries have evolved dramatically since the 1950s, when the Mekong represented the [...] "only large river left in the world, besides the Amazon, which remained virtually unexploited." [...] The impetus for the creation of the Mekong cooperation regime progressed in tandem with the drive {{for the development of the}} Lower Mekong, following the 1954 Geneva Conference which granted Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam independence from France. A 1957 United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) report, Development of Water Resources in the Lower Mekong Basin, recommended development to the tune of 90,000 km2 of irrigation and 13.7 gigawatts (GW) from five dams. [...] Based largely on the recommendations of ECAFE, the [...] "Committee for Coordination on the Lower Mekong Basin" [...] (known as the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee)</b> was established in September 1957 with the adoption of the Statute for the Committee for Coordination of Investigations into the Lower Mekong Basin. ECAFE’s Bureau of Flood Control had prioritized the Mekong - of the 18 international waterways within its jurisdiction - in the hopes of creating a precedent for cooperation elsewhere. The UN’s involvement represented the UN’s [...] "first direct involvement in international river basin planning" [...] and [...] "one of the UN's earliest spin-offs", as the organization functioned under the aegis of the UN, with its Executive Agent (EA) chosen from the carrier staff of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).|$|E

The average annual evaporation rate is 1455 mm {{with a standard deviation of}} 133 mm per month. The average annual precipitation recorded is 1590 mm with heavy rains recorded from April to October. The records of the Agrometerological Group of FAO of Research and Technology Development Division show the sunshine hours as 7.3 hours per day and the solar radiation at an annual average of 19.5 MJ/m2 per day.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. {{government}} - which {{feared that}} {{poverty in the}} Basin would contribute {{to the strength of}} communist movements - proved one of the most vocal international backers of the Committee, with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation conducting a seminal 1956 study on the basin’s potential. Another 1962 study by U.S. geographer Gilbert F. White, Economic and Social Aspects of Lower Mekong Development, proved extremely influential, notably resulting in the postponement of (in White’s own estimation) the construction of the (still unrealized) mainstream Pa Mong dam, which would have displaced a quarter-million people. The influence of the United States in the Committee’s formation can also been seen in development studies of General Raymond Wheeler, the former Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, the role of C. Hart Schaaf as the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee’s</b> Executive Agent from 1959 to 1969, and President Lyndon Johnson’s promotion of the Committee as having the potential to [...] "dwarf even our own T.V.A." [...] However, US financial support was terminated in 1975 and did not resume for decades due to embargoes against Cambodia (until 1992) and Vietnam (until 1994), followed by periods of trade restrictions. [...] However, Makim argues that the Committee was [...] "largely unaffected by formal or informal U.S. preferences" [...] given the ambivalence of some riparians about U.S. technical support, in particular Cambodia’s rejection of some specific types of assistance. However, the fact remains that [...] "international development agencies have always paid the bills for the Mekong regime," [...] with European (especially Scandinavian) nations picking up the slack left by the United States, and then (to a lesser extent) Japan.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 “International {{river basin}} {{is defined as}} an area {{extending}} over two or more states determined by the watershed limits {{of the system of}} waters, including surface and underground waters, flowing into a common terminus” (Shapiro-Libai, 1969, p. 22). There are 276 international river basins providing almost 60 % of global freshwater and supporting at least 40 % of the world population. Over recent decades, the riparian governments of the Lancang-Mekong River, like other international river basin leaders, may have had different and sometimes conflicting interests in promoting their economies through exploiting shared water, preserving their aquatic resources, or both, in the basin. Accordingly, their interactions have created water events, which can be neutral, conflictive, or cooperative. In this secondary-data paper, there are seven levels of conflicts and seven levels of cooperation, ranging from - 7 to - 1 and from + 1 to + 7, respectively. The main discussions of this paper focus on frequencies in each level, outstanding factors found in either conflicts or cooperation of the events, and policy implications. The 190 events from 1952 to 2010 in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin are found to be overwhelmingly cooperative. The result means that six riparian governments – China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam – would like to work together. However, these nations will need to do more, especially relating to three outstanding factors found in the conflictive events: dam development, navigation projects, and droughts. In addition, memberships of both China and Burma are strongly needed in the <b>Mekong</b> River <b>Committee</b> (MRC) ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{period was}} also marked by efforts {{to expand the}} {{jurisdiction}} and mandate of the Committee between 1958 and 1975, which did not receive the consent of all four riparians. However, these efforts culminated, in January 1975, in {{the adoption of a}} 35-article Joint Declaration of Principles for Utilization of the Waters of the Mekong Basin by the sixty-eighth session of the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee,</b> prohibiting the [...] "unilateral appropriation" [...] without [...] "prior approval" [...] and [...] "extra-basin diversion" [...] without unanimous consent. However, no Committee sessions were held in 1976 or 1977, as no plenipotentiary members had been appointed by Cambodia, Laos, or Vietnam - all of which experienced regime change in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|An {{evaluation}} of potential impacts of mainstream hydropower dams on Mekong fisheries, {{published by the}} Mekong River Commission in 1994, noted that the Sambor project would block upstream and downstream fish migration. Given that the Tonle Sap fisheries are of vital importance to the Cambodian people and economy, contributing approximately 60% towards Cambodia's annual fish landings, the Sambor and other planned mainstream dams on the Mekong {{have important implications for}} the country. [...] A recent policy brief by the WorldFish Center and the Cambodian National <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> points to the serious impacts dams could have on Cambodia's fisheries and on the fisheries in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam as a result of reduced river flows, and the 'flattening out' of the river's flood pulse.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> was a {{forceful}} advocate for large-scale dams and other projects, primarily preoccupied with facilitating projects. For example, the 1970 Indicative Basin Plan called for 30,000 km2 of irrigation {{by the year}} 2000 (up from 2,130 km2) as well as 87 short-term tributary development projects and 17 long-term development projects on the mainstream. The Indicative Basin Plan was crafted largely in response to criticisms of the Committee’s [...] "piecemeal" [...] approach and declining political support of the organization; for example, the Committee had received no funds from Thailand, normally the biggest contributor, during the 1970 fiscal year. The completion of all 17 projects was never intended; rather the list was meant {{to serve as a}} [...] "menu" [...] for international donors, who were to select 9 or 10 of the projects. While a few of the short-term projects were implemented, none of the long-term projects prevailed in the political climate of the ensuring decade, which included the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Several tributary dams were constructed, but only one - the Nam Ngum Dam (completed 1971), in Laos - outside of Thailand, whose electricity was sold to Thailand. According to Makim, Nam Ngum was the [...] "only truly intergovernmental project achieved" [...] by the Committee.|$|E

40|$|Agreement, {{the overall}} {{role of the}} MRC- an {{intergovernmental}} organization- is to provide assistance in regional coordination and policy development for issues pertaining to the Mekong River basin. Article 9 of this Agreement gives the MRC a specific mandate to promote and coordinate water transportation and to encourage freedom of navigation in the Lower Mekong region. Recognizing {{the importance of the}} Mekong River system as, inter alia, a source of valuable navigation potential, the MRC continues to stress investment in development and improvement of the waterborne transport sector. The underlying reason for this development is to attract investment and realise regional trade potential whilst safeguarding the environment, thereby creating better livelihoods for future generations living in the Basin. Inheriting the achievements of its predecessors’, the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> (1957 - 1975) and the Interim <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> (1978 - 1992), the MRC has developed the MRC Navigation Strategy since 2003, and formulated a five-year Navigation Programme (NAP). The Navigation Strategy identified significant opportunities as well as barriers to regional navigation development in the Lower Mekong Basin. It also identified institutional issues as the biggest barriers to overcome, providing preliminary suggestions in how they could be addressed. However, as no external financial support was available...|$|E

40|$|SummaryTransboundary {{data sharing}} is widely {{recognised}} {{as a necessary}} element in the successful handling of water-related climate change issues, {{as it is a}} means towards integrated water resources management (IWRM). However, in practice it is often a challenge to achieve it. The Mekong River Commission (MRC), an inter-governmental agency established by Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam, has adopted IWRM in its water strategy plan in order to properly manage the transboundary waters of the Mekong River. In this context, data sharing procedures were institutionalised and have been officially implemented by the four member countries since 2001. This paper uses a systematic approach to identify the extent of data sharing and the factors influencing the willingness of key individuals in the Vietnam National <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> and its Primary Custodians to share data. We find that the initial objectives of the Procedures for Data and Information Exchange and Sharing (PDIES) have not been fully achieved and, further, that Vietnam has much to gain and little to lose by engaging in data sharing in the MRC context. The primary motivation for data sharing stems from the desire to protect national benefits and to prevent upstream countries from overexploiting the shared water resources. However, data sharing is hindered by a lack of national regulations in the Vietnam context concerning data sharing between state agencies and outdated information management systems...|$|E
40|$|The Murray-Darling Basin Agreements {{had their}} genesis in {{disputes}} between upstream States (Victoria and New South Wales) and a downstream State (South Australia) {{over the use}} of basin waters. While originally the disputes concerned navigation, for most of the twentieth century, the rivers' use for irrigation has been of more importance. The 1914 Murray Waters Agreement, between the Commonwealth government and those of the three basin States, was essentially a compact defining allocation of water to the parties concerned. Agreements on the Murray-Darling basin have evolved from this narrowly-based concept to one in which the natural resources of the basin are to be managed as a whole. At the same time, an institutional structure for the operation of water control works has developed which is able to make policy for resource management in the basin. The present Agreement covers water, land and environmental resources, and contains provisions for strategies intended to enable the integrated and sustainable development of the basin in the future. The Mekong Agreements, rather than representing a consistent evolution towards a legal framework for comprehensive basin management, have instead reflected the political evolution of the region. The 1957 Statute was a limited compact establishing the <b>Mekong</b> <b>Committee</b> for the Co-ordination of Investigation. It made no provision for basin management, nor for the equitable use or sharing of basin water. It was established to a large extent as an expression of the influence of the United States in the region. Its successor, the Joint Declaration of 1975, was a more comprehensive document, and used the Helsinki Rules of 1966 as a model. While it included principles of cooperation between riparian States, which could be used to ensure equitable use of water, it did not provide an adequate institutional structure for the management of basin resources. The 1975 Declaration was drafted during a hiatus in the conflict in South East Asia; and because one of the signatory States - the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) - ceased to exist with the fall of Saigon, it was never applied. Interim arrangements were in place until 1995 during the absence of Cambodia from the international body politic. The drafting of new arrangements was then precipitated by Thailand's expulsion of the head of the Mekong Secretariat, effectively bringing the status quo to an end. The Mekong Agreement of 1995 establishes a new Commission, and states its purpose to be the sustainable development of basin resources. It relies on a co-operative approach, rather than establishing comprehensive criteria for water use, {{with the exception of the}} Mekong mainstream in the dry season. In addition, there is no provision for projects on tributaries to be submitted to the Commission for an evaluation of their effect downstream. In contrast to the arrangement under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, it confers no powers on the Commission to control basin waters, or to manage the regime in an effective manner, and to ensure equity between basin States. If development in a rational and equitable manner is assured, legal and institutional arrangements should be able to endure the ebb and flow of international relations. The need for an appropriate instrument to accommodate changing circumstances in the Mekong basin is made the more important by the prospect of the two upper basin States (China and Myanmar) joining the Agreement in the future. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, while it is a less than ideal model for legislation in this field, nevertheless offers guidance on how the new Mekong Agreement may be developed. This applies both to the management of basin resources, and to the preparation of strategies directed towards the objectives of the Agreement. The 1995 Mekong Agreement will be examined in the perspective that legislation should be stable and not static. While the Agreement has been duly praised for its intention of developing the basin through co-operation between States, this thesis looks at ways in which it may be improved. Significant issues effecting the choice of institutional and legal arrangements in both basins are identified and discussed. Findings from this comparison suggest a context for the further evolution of the institutional and legal framework to support the rational management and sustainable development of the Mekong basin.
