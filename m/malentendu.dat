50|$|The Misunderstanding (French: Le <b>Malentendu),</b> {{sometimes}} {{published as}} Cross Purpose, is a play written in 1943 in occupied France by Albert Camus. It focuses on Camus’ idea of The Absurd.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's <b>malentendu</b> to {{consider}} me Abstract Expressionist. I {{was invited to}} participate in many things, but I never considered myself part of that group, or any group, and it shows in my work." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{characters}} “unwittingly express ambiguities that escape their awareness”, {{and indirectly}} express philosophical ideas. Le <b>Malentendu</b> is “so heavily laden with ambiguities and multiple levels of {{meaning that it}} borders on caricature, a fact that may explain its relative failure as a tragedy”.|$|E
5000|$|Camus wrote Le <b>Malentendu</b> in 1942 and 1943 in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in Nazi-occupied France. Originally {{the play}} {{was to have been}} {{entitled}} Budejovice after the city České Budějovice in Czechoslovakia where Camus stayed briefly during a European trip with his first wife in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Le <b>Malentendu</b> “depicts the {{destruction}} of a family fatally incapable of communicating with each other”. Jan does not heed his wife Maria when she advises him to introduce himself plainly. His sister Martha accepts nothing but impersonal communication. Mother is too weary to respond to Jan’s hints.|$|E
50|$|In July 1942, she {{auditioned for}} Marcel Herrand who engaged her for his Théâtre des Mathurins. There, {{over the course}} of the next three years, she {{appeared}} in several plays including Deirdre of the Sorrows by J. M. Synge, The Master Builder by Ibsen, Le <b>Malentendu</b> (The Misunderstanding) by Albert Camus (with whom she had an affair), and an especially important premiere, Fédérico, after Prosper Mérimée, with Gérard Philipe.|$|E
50|$|Le <b>Malentendu</b> {{was staged}} {{for the first}} time at the Théâtre de Mathurins in Paris on 24 August 1944, {{directed}} by Marcel Herrand, who also played the part of Jan and with Maria Casarès as Martha. The performance coincided with the Liberation of Paris. The play had two short runs, neither particularly successful. It was the first of Camus' plays to be performed, although Caligula had been written 2 years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Le <b>Malentendu</b> “focused on Camus’ {{idea of the}} absurd. The core of {{this idea}} is that human desire is in {{perpetual}} conflict with {{a world that is}} arbitrary, illogical and unfair. A central theme of this play is that life does not distinguish between those who pursue a ‘bad’ path and those who pursue a ‘good’ path. Life, as Camus sees it, is equally cruel to the innocent and the criminal; this is the absurdity of existence” ...|$|E
50|$|The play “is {{a highly}} {{subjective}} presentation by Camus {{of the human}} condition as he saw it in the desperate circumstances of 1942-43”. It reflects several aspects of Camus’s life: he had left Algeria, to which he was deeply attached, leaving his second wife and friends behind; he was depressed with tuberculosis; as well as living under threat of execution as a propaganda agent of the French Resistance. Camus once described Le <b>Malentendu</b> as “the play that resembles me the most”.|$|E
50|$|The plot of Le <b>Malentendu</b> {{resembles the}} {{newspaper}} article that {{the protagonist of}} Camus' 1942 novel The Stranger finds under his mattress in his prison cell: {{it is the story}} of a man who became rich abroad and comes home to his village where his sister and mother have a hotel. He doesn't reveal his identity (in order to surprise them later), and books a room as a guest. Because he is wealthy, his mother and sister murder him while he is asleep.|$|E
5000|$|... “Although seen by {{a number}} of critics as a bleak piece of work, Camus did not regard Le <b>Malentendu</b> as pessimistic. He said: ‘When the tragedy is done, it would be {{incorrect}} to think that this play argues for submission to fate. On the contrary, it is a play of revolt, perhaps even containing a moral of sincerity’” [...] It implies that everything would have worked out all right if Jan had done what his wife begged him to do, or if Martha had responded to Jan’s personal questions or Mother had remembered when asked about her son. The family is destroyed through “failing to realise that values are not dreamed up in isolation but discovered communally”. “Camus himself remarked that he considered the play to have been a failure {{for the simple reason that}} everybody he met kept asking him what he meant. If they needed to ask, he argued, then the play itself was not clear, and he had not been successful as a playwright”.|$|E
50|$|Her {{earliest}} essays are on {{the subject}} of the theatre. Soixante ans de théâtre belge (1952), originally published in New York City in 1950 as The Belgian Theater since 1890, emphasizes the importance of a Flemish tradition. She followed this with Journal de l'analogiste (1954), in which the origin of the experience of beauty and poetry was guided by a path of analogies. A short essay Théâtre et mythomanie was published in 1958. Transcendence and metamorphosis are central to her seminal work Le Couple (1963), translated in 1965 as Aspects of Love in Western Society. In writings on Rubens, the Androgyne or homosexuality in Ancient Greece, Lilar meditates on the role of the woman in conjugal love throughout the ages. Translated into Dutch in 1976, it includes an afterword by Marnix Gijsen. In the same vein she later wrote critical essays on Jean-Paul Sartre (À propos de Sartre et de l'amour, 1967) and Simone de Beauvoir (Le <b>Malentendu</b> du Deuxième Sexe, 1969). Lilar's latter book was prophetic about the development of ideas from feminists like Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous, first presented to Americans in the popular anthology New French Feminisms (see Simons M.A, 1995, Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir, Penn State Press).|$|E

40|$|It {{would be}} {{legitimate}} {{to argue that}} the interpretations of Le <b>Malentendu</b> which I have read seemed to be somehow unrealistic and that perhaps a re-evaluation was needed. “Camus himself remarked that he considered the play to have been a failure {{for the simple reason that}} everybody he met kept asking him what he meant. If they needed to ask, he argued, then the play itself was not clear, and he had not been successful as a playwright”, wrote Philip Thody. The play seemed therefore open to various interpretations. The second point that attracted me was that, according to one of his critics, “Camus had never cut himself off from conversation with Christian thinkers but stood in a relation of tension to Christianity”...|$|E
40|$|Political {{correctness}} in {{the original}} language and in French translation. A revealing misunderstanding, Eric Fassin. In this affair, considered {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the misunderstanding is full of meaning. The pretended "Frenchness" of political correctness says a great deal about the fascinations and the rejections of French intelligence in the United States. In France, the quasi-unanimous denunciation of the "new McCarthyism" says even more about the excessively culturalist vision in which we enclose America. In the heat of the controversy, we fînd a confrontation between two public statuses and two models of the intellectual. Fassin Eric.

40|$|International audienceAt {{the core}} of the severe {{misunderstanding}} which is fuelling the ongoing tensions between Europe, the United States and the Muslim world, there resides a difficulty shared by the West as a whole : that of undertaking a rational and well thought-out assessment, first of the political, secondly of the intellectual and ethical roles of the various trends of “Political Islam” or “Radical Islamism”, too frequently considered as just so many stumbling-blocks on the road to consensual modernity and the peaceful coexistence of all the world's tribes. Au cœur du <b>malentendu</b> qui nourrit les tensions entre l'Europe et les États-Unis d'une part, le monde musulman d'autre part, réside une commune difficulté occidentale : celle que nous éprouvons à banaliser notre relation intellectuelle et politique avec des courants, dits islamistes, trop systématiquement considérés comme des obstacles à la modernisation consensuelle du monde...|$|E
40|$|The {{discipline}} of International Relations and cognate fields of Comparative Politics and Development Studies have {{more or less}} successfully contained the study of Africa’s condition {{within the limits of}} the dominant Western imagination, with grave consequences. Africa is seen and analyzed as a site of weak states and neopatrimonial rule. The continued dominance and ubiquity of such analytical vocabularies and their underlying methods rests on many forces, one of which is the reluctance to acknowledge that Africans can and do articulate their own analyses of their condition and to respect such analyses. This article seeks to remember some of the routinely forgotten international relations which structure Africa’s contemporary condition, by turning to the work of Cameroonian film director Jean-Marie Teno. Teno’s work, in particular Afrique Je Te Plumerai and Le <b>Malentendu</b> Colonial, is profoundly important for students of international relations. This article examines the content, form, and effect of the critique Teno elaborates in Afrique Je Te Plumerai...|$|E
