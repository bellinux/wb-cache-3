Numerous miniaturized easy-to-design passive circuits {{that can be used}} as critical building blocks for millimetre-wave SOP modules have been hereby realized with high performance and high integration potential. One miniaturized slotted <b>patch</b> <b>resonator</b> has been designed by the optimal use of vertical coupling mechanism and transverse cuts and has been utilized to realize compact duplexers (39. 8 GHz/ 59 GHz) and 3 and 5 poles band pass filters by the novel 3 D (vertical and parallel) deployment of single-mode <b>patch</b> <b>resonators.</b> Measured results agree very well with the simulated data. Also, one multiplexing filter, called directional channelseparation filter, {{that can be used in}} mixer applications shows insertion loss of < 3 dB over the bandpass frequency band and a rejection ~ 25 dB at around 38. 5 GHz over the band rejection section. LTCC fabrication limitations have been overcome by using vertical coupling mechanisms to satisfy millimetre-wave design requirements.

40|$|In this letter, a novel {{dual-mode}} bandpass balun filter {{is presented}} using a miniaturized cross-slotted <b>patch</b> <b>resonator.</b> This balun filter {{consists of a}} single slit-loaded patch etched {{by a pair of}} cross slots and a stepped-impedance open stub. An unbalanced input port is orthogonally arranged in-between two balanced output ports along the patch, and each feed line is connected to an additional stub for enhanced coupling.
