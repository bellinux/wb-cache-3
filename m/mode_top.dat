5000|$|V1449 Aquilae (HD 180642): This CoRoT {{target is}} a β Cephei star whose {{frequency}} spectrum reveals high frequency and very small amplitude acoustic modes. A careful analysis {{has shown that}} they were solar-like oscillations excited by turbulent bubbles origination from this convective iron opacity peak zone or even from the convective core. This is indeed a major discovery since {{it was the first}} time that pulsations excited by the κ mechanism acting in the iron opacity peak zone were present side by side in the same star with pulsations stochastically excited by this very same zone. This is the reason why Kevin Belkacem, main discoverer of these solar-like oscillations in V1449 Aquilae, added a new baptismal certificate to this β Cephei star and named it Chimera. The figure illustrates the behavior of the frequency versus time for two modes in the frequency spectrum of Chimera, a solar-like <b>mode</b> (<b>top)</b> and a β Cephei mode (bottom). The stochastic nature of the solar-like mode reveals itself in the instability of its frequency as time goes on and in the spread in frequency on several μHz. The contrast with the stability in frequency and the narrow frequency range of the β Cephei mode is striking.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{simplest}} universal extra-dimensional models Kaluza–Klein (KK) parity distinguishes {{the states with}} odd and even KK-number. We calculate the coupling of a 2 n-level top quark to a top quark and the Higgs scalar (both n= 0 states), absent at the tree level, which is mediated by strong interactions at one-loop. We show that {{the strength of this}} coupling is independent of n. We observe that the decay due to this coupling, which conserves KK-parity, can be a few per cent of the phase space suppressed decay to two n-level states which proceeds through tree-level couplings. We explore the prospects of verification of this result at the Large Hadron Collider through the production of a second-level KK top–antitop pair both of which subsequently decay to a zero <b>mode</b> <b>top</b> quark/antiquark and a Higgs boson...|$|E

40|$|Submitted to Phys. Lett. B; see {{paper for}} full list of authorsInternational audienceResults are {{presented}} from {{a search for}} supersymmetric particles in scenarios with a compressed mass spectrum. The data sample corresponds to 19. 7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The search targets top squark pair production in scenarios with mass differences Delta m = m(top squark) - m(neutralino) below the W-boson mass and with top-squark decays in the four-body <b>mode</b> (<b>top</b> squark to b l nu neutralino), where the neutralino {{is assumed to be}} the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The signature includes a high transverse momentum (pt) jet associated with initial-state radiation, one or two low-pt leptons, and significant missing transverse energy. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background contributions from standard model processes. Limits are set on the cross section for top squark pair production {{as a function of the}} top squark and LSP masses. Assuming a 100 % branching fraction for the four-body decay mode, top-squark masses below 316 GeV are excluded for Delta m= 25 GeV at 95 % CL. The dilepton data are also interpreted under the assumption of chargino-neutralino production, with subsequent decays to sleptons or sneutrinos. Assuming a difference between the common lightest chargino/next lightest neutralino mass and the LSP mass of 20 GeV and a tau-enriched decay scenario, masses in the range m(chargino) < 307 GeV are excluded at 95 % CL...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use atomic force microscopy (AFM), with submicron resolution, for morphophologic and morphometric analyses of acrosome intact and acrosome-reacted human sperm heads. A mixed population of acrosome intact and reacted sperm was produced by treating capacitated sperm with A 23187, which induced the acrosome reaction in sim? 50 % of total sperm population. This A 23187 -treated sperm suspension was then plated onto a coverslip and acrosome reacted sperm were preidentified by their specific staining with rhodamine-conjugated Concanavalin A. The sperm coverslip was then air-dried and scanned by a Nanoscope IIIa atomic force microscope, using the contact <b>mode.</b> <b>Top</b> and side view images processed through the illuminate mode revealed three dimensional sperm head contour, with the highest point situated in the head posterior in both acrosome intact and acrosome reacted sperm. Maximum height, length, and width measured in 50 acrosome intact and 50 acrosome-reacted sperm were the same in both populations. However, head length at half maximum height was significantly decreased in acrosome reacted sperm (2. 99 ??? 0. 24 mum vs. 3. 56 ??? 0. 32 mum of acrosome intact sperm), due to the sudden change of the height contour from the maximum peak to the anterior tip of acrosome-reacted sperm. Our results described here can therefore be used to differentiate acrosome intact and reacted sperm from each other. This would allow future studies on subcellular changes, related to the acrosome reaction, at the submicron resolution level under more physiological conditions, since AFM does not require fixing or staining of the samples.
