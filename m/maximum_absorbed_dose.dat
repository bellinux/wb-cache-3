An acrilyc phantom with a dimention of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm and a γ Argon gas filled detector have been modeled.

In contrast, the measurement performed by FKTN are 1. 8988 Gy/min and 1. 6676 Gy/min, respectively. These differences might be due to unperfection of the geometry phantom and the modele of the γ source.

Nevertheless, definitive dosimetric data are yet unavailable. According to the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, researchers are investigating the safety and efficacy of this radiotracer to meet Food and Drug Administration requirements. The aim {{of this study was to}} introduce the optimized procedure for 68 Ga-DOTATOC preparation, using a novel germanium- 68 (68 Ge) / 68 Ga generator in Iran and evaluate the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in numerous organs with high accuracy. Methods: The optimized conditions for preparing the radiolabeled complex were determined via several experiments by changing the ligand concentration, pH, temperature and incubation time. Radiochemical purity of the complex was assessed, using high-performance liquid chromatography and instant thin-layer chromatography. The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of human organs was evaluated, based on biodistribution studies on Syrian rats via Radiation <b>Absorbed</b> <b>Dose</b> Assessment Resource Method. Results: 68 Ga-DOTATOC was prepared with radiochemical purity of > 98 % and specific activity of 39. 6 MBq/nmol. The complex demonstrated great stability at room temperature and in human serum at 37 °C at least two hours after preparation. Significant uptake was observed in somatostatin receptor-positive tissues such as pancreatic and adrenal tissues (12. 83 %ID/g and 0. 91 %ID/g, respectively). Dose estimations in human organs showed that the pancreas, kidneys and adrenal glands received the <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> (0. 105, 0. 074 and 0. 010 mGy/MBq, respectively).

40|$|Several legacy {{hydraulic}} oil waste streams contaminated with Aroclor 1260 and {{small amounts of}} Cesium- 137 have been in storage at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) {{due to the lack}} of appropriate treatment facilities. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) could be selectively decomposed in the oils. Removal of the PCB component to less than the 2 mg/L treatment standard should result in a waste oil that is not regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act. Irradiation of the oils with high gamma-ray doses produces free electrons in the solution that react with PCBs. The reaction results in dechlorination of the PCBs to produce biphenyl. The gamma-ray source was spent reactor fuel stored in the Advanced Test Reactor canal at the INEL. A dry tube extends into the canal which allowed for positioning of samples in the proximity of the fuel. The gamma-ray dose rates at the samples varied from 10 to 30 kGy/h. This was measured using commercially available FWT- 60 dosimeters. Irradiation of samples in a series of progressively increasing absorbed doses allowed the generation of rate constants used to predict absorbed doses necessary to meet the 2 mg/kg treatment standard. Three separate irradiation experiments were performed. The first irradiation used a <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 183 kGy. This experiment demonstrated that the PCB concentration decreased and allowed calculation of preliminary rate constants. The second irradiation used a <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 760 kGy. From this experiment, accurate rate constants were calculated, and the necessary absorbed dose to achieve the treatment standard was calculated. In the third irradiation of 2, 242 kGy, all three waste streams were adequately decontaminated...|$|E

Two-dimensional distributions of radiation dose in the module were obtained. Absorbed dose rate and energy spectra of electrons, photons, neutrons and protons were also obtained at the three cryogenic thermometers locations by filling with silicon material in the appropriate locations, and radiation hardness of the thermometers was discussed.

40|$|The i-SANEX solvent {{formulation}} {{consisting of}} nominally 0. 2 M TODGA/ 5 % 1 -octanol/dodecane was γ-irradiated under realistic {{conditions in the}} Idaho National Laboratory radiolysis test loop, in contact with both extraction and stripping aqueous phases. The extraction aqueous phase was 4. 5 M HNO 3, and the stripping aqueous phase was 0. 018 M SO 3 –Ph–BTP/ 0. 35 M HNO 3. When irradiated in contact with only the 4. 5 M HNO 3 phase, the TODGA solvent maintained excellent extraction performance for americium, cerium, europium, and neodymium to a <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of nearly 0. 9 MGy. The results for preliminary static, batch irradiations were consistent with test loop findings. When the aqueous phase was changed to that containing the aqueous soluble BTP, the irradiated aqueous phase showed a dramatic color change, {{but this does not}} appear to have had adverse effect on solvent extraction performance. The distribution ratios for both the lanthanides and actinides were invariant with absorbed dose, and the separation factors were essentially unchanged to a <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 174 kGy. The results of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of the aqueous and organic phases showed that ruthenium and strontium were not extracted in the presence of the irradiated BTP-aqueous phase. Molybdenum was extracted under both conditions. Further, the buildup of corrosion products of stainless steel in the presence of the BTP was not dramatically greater than in the nitric acid-only system. Phase separation times were not adversely affected by irradiation for either system. The results presented here indicate that the performance of the TODGA/SO 3 –Ph–BTP, i-SANEX process under test loop radiolysis is much better than expected based on a literature report using single-phase batch irradiation experiments, and better than might be predicted based on diglycolamide radiolysis studies alone...|$|E
30|$|In PRRT with 177 Lu, the {{important}} inter-patient variations in peptide pharmacokinetics require treatment individualization by tailoring {{the number of}} cycles or the administered activity [11]. In this context, therapy planning based on the <b>maximum</b> tolerable <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to non-target organs (“as high as safely attainable”, AHASA approach) [12] could be considered, instead of the “as low as reasonably achievable” (ALARA) approach (i.e., the dose to non-target tissues should be reasonably low). However, currently, a fixed activity of 7.4  GBq per cycle, {{as described in the}} NETTER- 1 trial, is usually administered.

30|$|A {{range of}} {{publications}} during {{recent years has}} reported on the clinical value of radionuclide therapy directed towards somatostatin receptors for therapy of patients with neuroendocrine tumours [3, 4,  6, 13]. Still, many issues remain to be solved {{in order to improve}} and personalize the therapy [26]. In the literature, a general agreement on the importance of individualized therapy is noted, where dosimetry is one tool to achieve an individual risk-assessment for sensitive organs [27]. Kidney toxicity is a limiting factor for radionuclide therapy with somatostatin analogs, especially when using 90 Y [4, 14, 20]. The observed kidney toxicity for therapy with 177 Lu-DOTATATE is lower, with a <b>maximum</b> tolerable <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> yet to be defined [3, 27].|$|R
30|$|Whether {{or not the}} {{patients}} treated empirically at fixed activity with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE should have a follow-up of the dosimetry to the critical organs is subject to controversy. In the NETTER- 1 trial [3], post-treatment dosimetry {{was not part of}} the protocol, although a sub-study on a small sample of patients did include dosimetry. On the other hand, some authors [2, 5, 16, 24, 31] do recommend performing post-treatment scan in order to assess the radiation <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to critical organs and manage {{the patients}} accordingly. Also, there is scarce knowledge about the threshold of maximal safe radiation dose to the kidneys, mainly because of the lack of long-term data for this recently introduced treatment. The current accepted thresholds are inferred from external beam radiation treatments, whose energy deposit is obtained in a fraction of second while being extended over days and weeks in PRRT. Further studies that would prospectively assess the <b>maximum</b> safe <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to kidneys of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE are needed.|$|R

40|$|Background & Objectives: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) represents 11 % of all {{diagnostic radiology}} procedures but {{it contributes to}} almost 67 % of the total effective dose to the human population. In head and neck CT which consist of 1 / 3 of total CT scans, other critical organs such as lenses and thyroid are in the radiation field. Also in the abdomen and pelvis scan, irradiation of ovaries is unavoidable. Because of high sensitivity of these organs, the probability of abnormality and cancer in these organs has increased. Therefore the dose assessment in these organs is very important. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the absorbed dose in critical organ of patient undergoing common head, neck, abdomen and pelvic spiral CT scan. Materials & Methods: In this study, Lithium fluoride thermo luminescent dosimeters (TLD- 100, Harshaw) were used to determine the absorbed dose of critical organ of tissue equivalent rando phantom (Alderson research industries, Inc, Stanford, Conn, U. S. A). The phantom was sectional in design and manufactured with a 2. 5 cm slab thickness. Each section contained some holes that allowed accommodation of TLDs. At least two crystals were placed in each hole. The average value of the TLD readings was taken as the organ dose. Readouts were obtained on a Harshaw 4500 reader (Harshaw, Ohio, USA). For calibration, the annealed dosimeters were exposed to an X-ray beam resulting from 120 kVp tube voltage and calibration curve was plotted. Results: result of this study showed during head CT scan the <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> belongs to occipital bones skin. Which were about 11. 45 mGy and the minimum absorbed dose belong to thyroid gland which was 0. 5 mGy. During abdomen & pelvic spiral CT, the <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of abdomen skin was 23. 32 mGy and the minimum absorbed dose in the eye region was 0. 15 mGy. The readout results are correlated with the results of spiral CT detector with the “ALARA” principle, we recommend suitable techniques should be selected to reduce absorbed dose of critical organ without reducing image quality. Conclusion: further research is required to investigate whether modification of the parameters used during routine spiral CT scan can be limited absorbed dose of critical organ without a significant loss of image quality...|$|E

40|$|Purpose  To assess patient {{skin and}} eye lens doses in interventional neuroradiology {{and to assess}} both {{stochastic}} and deterministic radiation risks. Methods  Kerma–area product (P KA) was recorded and skin doses measured using thermoluminescence dosimeters.

The average and maximum P KA for coiling were 121 and 436  Gy cm 2, respectively, and 189 and 677  Gy cm 2 for embolisation. The average and maximum values of the measured <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> skin <b>doses</b> were 0. 72 and 3. 0  Sv, respectively, for coiling and 0. 79 and 2. 1  Sv for embolisation. Two out of the 52 patients received skin doses in excess of 2  Sv. The average and maximum doses to the eye lens (left eye) were 51 and 515  mSv (coiling) and 71 and 289  mSv (embolisation). Conclusion  The ratio between the measured dose and the dose at the IRP was 0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 18  mSv/mGy indicating that the dose displayed by the x-ray unit overestimates the maximum skin dose but is still a valuable indication of the dose.

30|$|This review {{provides}} a structured overview of modern dosimetry methods in PRRT and their current clinical applications, potentials and limitations in NET treatment. In the last decade, many steps {{have been made}} towards personalised PRRT in NET using dosimetry. The incentive to perform dosimetry to optimise PRRT for individual patients is of importance, as limited data about maximum tolerable dose to normal tissue and optimal tumour dose is still known [67]. For instance, three phase II studies did not reach the maximum tolerated administered activity, while reporting response rates between 7 and 54 % [68 – 70]. Though we are far from achieving high response rates, most patients treated with PRRT are assumed palliative patients, so optimising treatment implicates extending a patient’s life in relative good health. The individual optimal number of cycles and administered activity can be determined using tumour and normal tissue dosimetry. On the other hand, population data {{can be used to}} determine for example the average <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the kidney and the influence of fractionated treatment [71]. Nevertheless, several hurdles need to be overcome prior to routine clinical implementation.|$|E

40|$|In {{computed}} tomography (CT), some superficial organs which have increased sensitivity to radiation, receive doses that are significant {{enough to be}} matter of concern.

Considering the <b>maximum</b> reduction in <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and X-ray spectrum, using a lead shield with a maximum thickness of 0. 4 mm would be appropriate for testes and thyroid and two other organs (which are exposed directly) should be protected with thinner shields.

On this construction, the distinct simulations were processed by the MCNPX code and then obtained the PDD and profiles for the whole depths of the radiation beam. The results data were used by the code to produce the dose percentages in any point of the irradiated volume. The absorbed dose for any voxel’s size was also reproduced at any point of the irradiated volume, even when the voxels are considered to be of a pixel’s size. The dosimetric algorithm is able to reproduce the absorbed dose induced by a radiation beam over a water phantom, considering PDD and profiles, whose maximum percent value is in the build-up region.

30|$|Pre- and {{post-treatment}} are not {{the only}} time points for dosimetry, as Bourgeois et al. report on intra-procedural PET/CT in a case study [120]. They used a 3 -step protocol wherein the first step 90 Y microspheres with a total activity determined by the BSA model were administered to the patient. For the second step, the patient was transferred for PET/CT imaging. The <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> by normal hepatic parenchyma and the average absorbed dose by the tumor were determined. For one out of the six patients in this study, the absorbed dose by the tumor was below the assumed tumoricidal absorbed dose of 100 – 120  Gy for HCC (the other five patients reached this threshold with the first infusion, which was based on the BSA model). For this single, undertreated patient, the third step of the protocol was performed which was a repeated infusion of 90 Y microspheres with an optimized activity determined from the quantitative PET/CT data to reach the target tumor absorbed dose. Although the initial treatment planning was based on the suboptimal BSA method, the dosimetry based on the intra-procedural PET/CT scan allowed for activity delivery based on patient-specific physiology {{at the time of the}} procedure. The downsides of this 3 -step protocol are the increased time, costs, and access to equipment and personnel.|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{included}} clinical studies {{were designed for}} safety monitoring; 12 articles focussed on the kidney and 4 articles on bone marrow (BM) toxicity. Regarding kidney toxicity, multiple publications recommended individualised kidney dosimetry due to the high interpatient variability of absorbed doses [13, 52, 54, 61]. Dose-response relations were presented in various papers, for example, Schuchardt et al. described the association between mean absorbed doses and kidney toxicity [41]. An individualised treatment schedule for PRRT with standardised kidney absorbed doses of 23  Gy was proposed by Del Prete et al., which resulted in increased tumour doses while limiting renal toxicity in simulated personalised treatment schemes. Hence, a personalised PRRT schema based on tumour dosimetry would have led to higher mean absorbed doses to the kidney. This method is currently evaluated in a prospective clinical trial [40]. Most studies adopted kidney absorbed dose thresholds between 23 and 27  Gy [9, 36, 40, 62]. Bergsma et al. suggested to increase the kidney <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> up to 28  Gy [36]. This {{is supported by the}} fact that half of the patients do not reach 23  Gy after 4  cycles of 7.4  GBq 177 Lu-DOTATATE [57].

30|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of Publication 103 of the ICRP [14], these <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were then sex-averaged and the effective dose was evaluated using the tissue weighting factors of Publication 60 of the ICRP [15]. Recommendations of the ICRP subsequent to this publication were followed in the effective <b>dose</b> evaluation: the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the thymus gland {{was used as a}} surrogate for that to the oesophagus; the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the colon wall was calculated as the mass-weighted sum of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the walls of the upper and lower large intestines; and the gonadal <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was taken to be the mean of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the testes and ovaries [16].|$|R
30|$|Among the {{patients}} who did not complete 4  cycles, 14 were stopped because of an expected kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the following cycle higher than 25  Gy. Indeed, at our institution, before giving a subsequent cycle of treatment, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to kidneys during the previous (p) treatments are examined and an expected cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the following (p[*]+[*] 1) cycle is determined. The latter is calculated as the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> over the previous (p) treatments to which is added the cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> over these (p) treatments. We withheld PRRT if the expected cumulated <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the subsequent treatment was predicted to exceed 25  Gy for kidneys (except for very specific cases where cost/benefit ratio led us to continue treatment). For instance, a cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> above 18.75  Gy after the third cycle would lead to stop the treatment.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While {{the number}} of CTA {{examinations}} is continually increasing com-pared with DSA examinations, there is little comparative dose information about the different imaging techniques. We compared patient radiation exposure resulting from diagnostic CTA and DSA exami-nations for both cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated by using typical diagnostic CTA and DSA setups and imaging parameters. For both imaging techniques, the imaging area of cerebral vessels included intracranial vessels only, while the imaging area of cervicocerebral vessels included both cervical and intracranial vessels from the aortic arch to the vertex. The effective dose was determined by using RPLDs. The DSA examination was simulated by using a biplane angiography system, and the CTA examination, by using a 64 -row multidetector CT scanner. RESULTS: For the imaging of cerebral vessels, the effective dose according to ICRP 103 was 0. 67 mSv for CTA and 2. 71 mSv for DSA. For the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose was 4. 85 mSv for CTA and 3. 60 mSv for DSA. The <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> (milligray) for skin, brain, salivary glands, and eyes was 166. 2, 73. 5, 35. 6, and 21. 8 mGy for DSA and 19. 0, 16. 9, 20. 4, and 14. 8 mGy for CTA, respectively. The conversion factors from DAP and DLP to effective dose were calculated...|$|E

In this work isodose curves are {{obtained by the}} use of a new dosimetric algorithm using numerical data from percentage depth dose (PDD) and the <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> profile, calculated by Monte Carlo in a 18 MV LINAC. The software allows reproducing the absorbed dose percentage in the whole irradiated volume quickly and with a good approximation. To validate results an 18 MV LINACwith awhole geometry and awater phantomwere constructed. On this construction, the distinct simulationswere processed by the MCNPX code and then obtained the PDD and profiles for the whole depths of the radiation beam. The results data were used by the code to produce the dose percentages in any point of the irradiated volume. The absorbed dose for any voxel’s size was also reproduced at any point of the irradiated volume, even when the voxels are considered to be of a pixel’s size. The dosimetric algorithm is able to reproduce the absorbed dose induced by a radiation beam over a water phantom, considering PDD and profiles, whose maximum percent value is in the build-up region. Calculation time for the algorithm is only a few seconds, compared with the days taken when it is carried out by Monte Carlo. 1...|$|E
40|$|A car-borne {{survey was}} carried out in the northwestern, or Tokatsu, area of Chiba Prefecture, Japan, to make a {{detailed}} distribution map of absorbed dose rate in air four years after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. This area was chosen because it was the most heavily radionuclide contaminated part of Chiba Prefecture and it neighbors metropolitan Tokyo. Measurements were performed using a 3 -in × 3 -in NaI(Tl) scintillation spectrometer in June 2015. The survey route covered the whole Tokatsu area which includes six cities. A heterogeneous distribution of absorbed dose rate in air was observed on the dose distribution map. Especially, higher absorbed dose rates in air exceeding 80 nGy h- 1 were observed along national roads constructed using high porosity asphalt, whereas lower absorbed dose rates in air were observed along local roads constructed using low porosity asphalt. The difference between these asphalt types resulted in a heterogeneous dose distribution in the Tokatsu area. The mean of the contribution ratio of artificial radionuclides to absorbed dose rate in air measured 4 years after the accident was 29 % (9 - 50 %) in the Tokatsu area. The <b>maximum</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate in air, 201 nGy h- 1 was observed at Kashiwa City. Radiocesium was deposited in the upper 1 cm surface layer of the high porosity asphalt which was collected in Kashiwa City and the environmental half-life of the absorbed dose rate in air was estimated to be 1. 7 years...|$|E

40|$|Radioembolisation (RE), with yttrium- 90 (90 Y) {{labelled}} microspheres, is {{an increasingly}} common treatment method for unresectable liver tumours. The tolerable mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for normal liver (NL) tissue {{is higher in}} RE than in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT); <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity {{is thought to be}} one important reason, together with a low <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate, but the knowledge of microsphere distributions is limited. The aim of this thesis was to describe macroscopic and small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of microspheres and consequently in <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> and to create a hepatic branching artery tree model, able to reproduce normal liver microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Another aim was to develop and evaluate a method for prediction of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands during liver resection on still radioactive tissues. Two patients with marginally resectable cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection, nine days after RE with resin SIR-Spheres®. Considering radiation safety, simulation of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands was performed with the software Varskin Mod 2 ® before surgery and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements were done with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) on resected tissue. The macroscopic sphere distribution within NL was investigated by gamma well chamber activity measurements on punch biopsies from sliced resected tissues and by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (SK), in relation to biopsy mass. Small-scale heterogeneity in microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution was studied by light microscopy and subsequent <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> simulations by beta dose point kernel convolution. A branching artery tree model was used, to simulate microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Tissue measurements and simulations of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands showed similar results. The CV and SK of activity concentration, by gamma well chamber measurements, decreased rapidly with increasing mass and/or mean activity concentration. Aggregations of clusters increased in frequency and CV and SK for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model was able to resemble the biopsy sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Expected <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands was not alarming, but simulations and measurements of surgeon finger <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> are recommended. Decreasing CV and SK for macroscopic distribution indicated a heterogeneous pattern larger than the punch biopsy masses investigated. Small-scale sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity both increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model helps to explain the distribution mechanism better than previous distribution models. The shown heterogeneity and the arterial tree model provide knowledge that may be helpful in optimising RE treatment, regarding number of injected spheres and activity per sphere...|$|R

The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> per activity was approximately 30 % to 40 % lower when chewing tasteless gum. The above findings demonstrate that the increased blood flow {{appears to be a}} decisive factor causing the increased <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in the lemon-juice stimulation group. However, {{no significant difference in the}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity (P[*]≥[*] 0.60) was observed between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups (Figure  4); the percentage difference of the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was − 8 % for the submandibular gland and 5 % for the parotid gland. Contrary to the expectation, chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation yielded similar <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity.
