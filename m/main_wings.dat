5|$|On 16 July 1868, a Progressive cabinet led by Zacarias {{resigned}} {{following a}} political crisis and PedroII asked the Conservatives {{to form a}} new government. As always when a party returned to power, new elections were held, though marked by fraud. The two <b>main</b> <b>wings</b> of the Progressive Party (Progressive, to which Porto Alegre belonged, and Historical) set aside their disputes, became more disciplined in their unity and renamed their party the Liberal Party. When Porto Alegre's term as general deputy ended in 1866, the ongoing war precluded elections in Rio Grande do Sul. Predictably, in the elections organized under the Conservative Party's direction in early 1869, he was not elected. He turned his attention to organizing a Liberal stronghold in his native province. At the request of the national Liberal Center, Porto Alegre created and became president of the province's Liberal board of directors.|$|E

40|$|A {{convertiplane}} structure (100), {{having a}} longitudinal axis x and a plane n orthogonal to it, comprises a <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> (120) arranged to rotate about {{at least one}} transversal rotation axis y, an auxiliary wing (130), which is located back with respect to <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> (120), and arranged to rotate about at least one transversal rotation axis y', at least two main propellers (220) located on the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> (120), {{and at least two}} auxiliary propellers (230) located on the auxiliary wing (130). The auxiliary wing (130) is located at a vertical height higher than <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> (120). Two vertical wings (140) are also provided located {{in such a way that}} the projections on the plane n of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> (120), of the auxiliary wing (130) and of the vertical wings (140) shape a closed polygon, thus reducing the induced drag and increasing the overall aerodynamic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic force {{tests were}} made on a {{combination}} of a Clark Y wing and a narrow auxiliary airfoil to find the best location of the auxiliary airfoil with respect to the <b>main</b> <b>wing.</b> The auxiliary was a highly cambered airfoil of medium thickness having a chord 14. 5 per cent that of the <b>main</b> <b>wing.</b> It was tested in 141 different positions ahead of, above, and behind the nose portion of the <b>main</b> <b>wing,</b> the range of the test points being extended until the best aerodynamic conditions were covered. A range of positions was found in which the combination of <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and auxiliary gave substantially greater aerodynamic efficiency and higher maximum lift coefficients (based on total area) than the <b>main</b> Clark Y <b>wing</b> alone. In the optimum position tested, considering both the maximum lift and the speed-range ratio, the combination of <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and auxiliary gave an increase in the maximum lift coefficient of 32 per cent together with an increase in the ratio of 21 per cent of the respective values for the <b>main</b> Clark Y <b>wing</b> alone...|$|R
25|$|The villa {{itself is}} sited {{in an unusual}} {{location}} – the unevenness of the terrain, which was riddled with small streams and natural springs, would seem to render it unsuitable for such a large dwelling. It is thought, however, that these springs would have been harnessed into water features in stylised gardens, and that a cult of water nymphs may have been cultivated around this, although this is supposition. To cope with the difficult terrain, the building itself was constructed on four terraces, cut into the hillside and heavily buttressed, which are still evident on the gallery connecting the two <b>main</b> <b>wings</b> of the house. The architectural design of the villa differs greatly from similar dwellings from the same period, given that the main living quarters were in the large eastern wing, and a long gallery of little function connected this wing with the ‘leisure wing’ where the bath house and temple were located. This layout reflects {{the evolution of the}} house over time—the bath house wing was a later expansion—and a consideration of the spatial restrictions of the site.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{expansion}} of the campus Swedish American Hospital now includes several separate and interconnecting structures. The main campus is bounded by East State Street (US 20) on its north and by East Charles Street on its south-southwest side. Intersecting Charles and State Streets at the hospital's west boundary is Ninth Street, to the east is Williams Park. The buildings within the main Swedish American complex include the 94 bed heart hospital, SwedishAmerican Regional Cancer Center, a state of the art radiology and oncology center, opened in July 2013, Camelot Tower, the Renaissance Pavilion, the two <b>main</b> <b>wings,</b> and two other buildings which are located {{on the periphery of the}} main campus. The Ninth Street Center is located across Ninth Street from Swedish American Hospital and the L.P Johnson Building is located in the complex's far northwest corner. The hospital also owns an 1873 Gothic Revival house, known as the Lake-Peterson House which was donated by the estate of Pehr August Peterson. The house stands on the main Swedish American campus and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The emergency room entrance at Swedish American is located on the buildings west facade and is entered via a driveway that stretches from Charles Street, across the complex, to State Street.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well preserved Anchiornis specimen in the Beijing Museum of Natural History to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this Anchiornis when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of Sinosauropteryx), Anchiornis became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved). The study found that most of the body feathers of this Anchiornis specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly rufous with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white <b>main</b> <b>wings.</b> The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe vortex {{interference}} mechanism on low Reynolds number {{between the}} canard and <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> of the canard-forward sweep wing (Canard-FSW) configurations is simulated numerically by employing the {{numerical wind tunnel}} method. The variations of aerodynamic characteristics of Canard-FSW configurations with different positions of the canard are investigated, finding that the aerodynamic interference and mutual coupling effect between the canard and <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> have made great contributions to the lift and stability characteristics of the whole aircraft. Canard can radically improve the surface flow pattern of the <b>main</b> <b>wing.</b> And its own vortex can have a favorable interference on the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and can effectively control the airflow boundary layer separation. At small angles of attack, the aerodynamic characteristics {{are sensitive to the}} positions of the canard and the <b>main</b> <b>wing,</b> but at high angles of attack, the aerodynamic performances of the configuration are not only related to the shape of the canard (forward or backward), but also with the size of control force as well as the features of the vortices generated above the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and the canard. The different configurations and vortices are illustrated using the velocity vector, streamlines and pressure contours...|$|R
50|$|ZIA {{adopts a}} radical {{design in the}} {{development}} of called Shape Varying VTOL UAV by eliminating the vertical stabilizer while at the same time, adopting canards to a flying wing with tiltrotor. The outer portion of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> can be folded downward 90 degrees during vertical takeoff and landing, and the folded portion of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> also doubles as the landing gear system. At the level flight, the folded outer portion of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> is folded back, extending the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> back to its normal size. The UAV is powered by a total of four triple-blade propellers driven by engines, two of which are installed in the fuselage in tandem, acting as the lift engines providing half of the lift. The remaining lift comes from the remaining pair of engines that are installed between the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and the canards, and these two engines would tilt 90 degrees after takeoff, providing propulsion in level flight, while the two lift engines would shut off.|$|R
40|$|The lift, drag, {{and center}} of {{pressure}} characteristics of {{a model of the}} Fowler variable-area wing were measured in the NACA 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel. The Fowler wing consists of a combination of a <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and an extension surface, also of airfoil section. The extension surface can be entirely retracted within the lower rear portion of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> or it can be moved to the rear and downward. The tests were made with the nose of the extension airfoil in various positions near the trailing edge of the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> and with the surface at various angular deflections. The highest lift coefficient obtained was C(sub L) = 3. 17 as compared with 1. 27 for the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> alone...|$|R

500|$|The palace, to the {{north-east}} of the headland, {{was built}} in the late 16th century and early to mid-17th century. It comprises three <b>main</b> <b>wings</b> set out around a quadrangle, {{and for the most part}} is probably the work of the 5th Earl Marischal who succeeded in 1581. It provided extensive and comfortable accommodation to replace the rooms in the tower house. In its long, low design it has been compared to contemporary English buildings, in contrast to the Scottish tradition of taller towers still prevalent in the 16th century. Seven identical lodgings are arranged along the west range, each opening onto the quadrangle and including windows and fireplace. Above the lodgings the west range comprised a [...] gallery. Now roofless, the gallery originally had an elaborate oak ceiling, and on display was a Roman tablet taken from the Antonine Wall. At the north end of the gallery was a drawing room linked to the north range. The gallery could also be accessed from the Silver House to the south, which incorporated a broad stairway with a treasury above.|$|E

To further streamline the design, the surface radiators were installed on the upper surface of the wing.|$|E
50|$|A {{tailless}} aircraft has no tail assembly {{and no other}} horizontal surface besides its <b>main</b> <b>wing.</b> The aerodynamic control and stabilisation functions in both pitch and roll are incorporated into the <b>main</b> <b>wing.</b> A tailless type may still have a conventional vertical fin (vertical stabilizer) and rudder.|$|R
50|$|On a canard aircraft, {{to allow}} natural static pitch {{stability}} in normal flight, the foreplane must provide lift. Also, {{in order for}} the aircraft to have safe stall characteristics the foreplane must stall before the <b>main</b> <b>wing,</b> pitching the aircraft down and allowing the aircraft to recover. This means that a safety margin must be used on the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> area so that its maximum lift coefficient and wing loading are never attained in practice. This in turn means that the <b>main</b> <b>wing</b> must be increased in size.|$|R

2500|$|When {{mounted on}} its booster pack, the Hercules missile was [...] long with a {{wingspan}} of [...] (one side only). The upper stage alone was [...] long. The fuselage had a bullet-like shape (Sears–Haack body), {{but this was}} difficult to make out due {{to the presence of}} the four large delta wings running almost {{the entire length of the}} fuselage. Each wing ended with a control flap which was separated from the wing by a short distance, leaving a gap. The back of the controls were even with the extreme rear of the missile. Smaller deltas in front of the <b>main</b> <b>wings,</b> and blended into them, provided roll control with very small flaps mounted to pivot along a line roughly 45 degrees from the line of the fuselage.

The lower set of wings were little more than stubs; their bracing to the upper wings passed through the engine nacelles (mounted on the upper wings), and they carried the pontoon undercarriage beneath them. Following typical Fairchild construction, the fuselage and empennage were made of fabric-covered welded steel tubing while the <b>main</b> <b>wings</b> were a combination of spruce spars and stainless steel ribs, also fabric covered.

2500|$|BSP is {{believed}} to have suffered both electoral (reduced support among its core sympathizers) and political losses (losing ground to new populist and nationalist parties) due to its supposed role in the entrenchment of the [...] "Who" [...] model (Bulgarian: моделът [...] "КОЙ"), which is assumed to have been exemplified by the Oresharski government. References to this model - implying inappropriate interlinkages between government, big business, media and other [...] "shadowy forces" [...] which bring about an erosion of constitutional and democratic practices - were frequently made during the anti-Oresharski demonstrations.
