5|$|The Soviet Union {{received}} {{details of}} British research from its atomic spies Klaus Fuchs, Engelbert Broda, Melita Norwood and John Cairncross, {{a member of}} the notorious Cambridge Five. Alan Nunn May was recruited later in Canada. Lavrenty Beria's report to Stalin of March 1942 included the MAUD reports and other British documents passed by Cairncross. Fuchs began disclosing information to the Soviet Union about the possible production of a British atomic bomb when he joined the Tube Alloys project, although his contribution towards Soviet espionage was more severe during the Manhattan Project. Fuchs was able to contact a London-based KPD leader, Jürgen Kuczynski, Kuczynski put him in contact with Simon Davidovitch Kremer, the secretary to the military attaché at the Soviet Union's embassy, who worked for the GRU (Russian: Главное Разведывательное Управление), the Red Army's foreign <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>directorate.</b> After three meetings, Fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to London. She was Ruth Kuczynski, the sister of Jurgen Kuczynski. She was also a German communist, a major in Soviet Military Intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with Richard Sorge's spy ring in the Far East.|$|E

Ben-Menashe also claimed that in 1986 Maxwell had told the Israeli Embassy in London that Mordechai Vanunu had given information about Israel's nuclear capability to the Sunday Times, then to the Daily Mirror. Vanunu was subsequently kidnapped by Mossad and smuggled to Israel, convicted of treason and imprisoned for 18 years.|$|E

500|$|In Israel, Chief of the <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate</b> Aharon Yariv {{stated that}} a raid would damage Fatah's prestige. On the other hand, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban and {{his chief of}} bureau Gideon Rafael — mindful of an adverse American {{reaction}} due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US — worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel. Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev promised a [...] "clean action". Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan asked for a [...] "principal approval" [...] for a raid, but this was denied by the cabinet. On 13 December, Operation Karameh was scheduled for the next night, it {{was placed in the}} hands of both Brigade 35 of the Paratroop Corps and the Sayeret Matkal special-operations force. The operation was called off, rescheduled for 12 March and then called off again. Dayan warned the other ministers that a bus might strike a mine. On 18 March, an Israeli school bus was blown up by a mine near Be'er Ora in the Arava, killing two adults and wounding ten children. This was the 38th Fatah operation in little more than three months. That night, the cabinet approved the attack. The U.S. tried to prevent it by forwarding Israel a message from King Hussein. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol called in the cabinet for further counseling; only the National Religious Party leader Haim-Moshe Shapira vocally opposed the attack, while Education Minister Zalman Aran opposed it too but remained silent.|$|E

2500|$|Following Israel's {{withdrawal}} from Sinai, captured during the 1956 Suez Crisis, the peninsula remained de facto demilitarized of most Egyptian forces. It was garrisoned by one infantry brigade, elements of several reconnaissance regiments {{and up to}} 100 tanks. Although {{the outcome of the}} Suez Crisis had been politically positive for Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Israel's <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate</b> (Aman), as well as military and civilian decision makers, had regarded Israel's military victory in the war as an effective deterrent to future Egyptian designs. In early 1960, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, therefore, estimated that Egypt would seek [...] "to avoid a military confrontation with Israel and keep the United Nations Emergency Force" [...] (UNEF) installed in the Gaza Strip following the crisis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 Ben-Menashe joined Israel's <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate.</b> He {{later said}} [...] "I {{happened}} to be the right guy at the right time.

[...] In his book Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network Ben-Menashe said that following the 1979 Iranian Revolution his Iranian background provided useful connections, with some of his school friends playing roles in the new government. These connections, Ben-Menashe said, led to his playing an intermediary role in the Israeli effort to sell arms to Iran, and close to the Israeli government decision to back the Reagan campaign's [...] "October Surprise" [...] efforts to ensure Iranian hostages were released on a timetable that strengthened Ronald Reagan and not the incumbent President Carter.|$|E
2500|$|With Ben-Menashe's claims {{remaining}} in the public eye, in early 1991 The New Republics Steven Emerson travelled to Israel, and on his return described Ben-Menashe as merely a [...] "low-level translator", even though the references described Ben-Menashe as working in [...] "key positions" [...] and handling [...] "complex and sensitive assignments." [...] Parry later wrote that other documents confirmed Ben-Menashe's travels: [...] "Ben-Menashe's passports and other documents revealed that he had traveled extensively with frequent trips to Latin America, Eastern Europe, the United States and elsewhere, not exactly {{the record of the}} stay-at-home, low-level translator that Israel was trying to sell to me and other journalists." [...] Emerson also published his claims in other outlets, and Newsweek (which Parry had left in June 1990) also attacked Ben-Menashe. In 1992, however, Moshe Hebroni, the deputy director of the <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate,</b> told Craig Unger that Ben-Menashe had worked directly with him and had access to sensitive material. Additionally, in the Israeli daily Davar, reporter Pazit Ravina wrote that [...] "in talks with people who worked with Ben-Menashe, the claim that he had access to highly sensitive intelligence information was confirmed again and again." ...|$|E

The R&AW and IB agencies are composed largely of civilians. Military personnel are often deputed to these agencies, but {{the letter of the law}} and concerns of deniability limit the use of serving military officers in some types of activity (especially collection and action). The creation of an intelligence agency co-ordinating the intelligence arms of the three military services had long been called for by senior Indian military officers. It was formally recommended by the Cabinet Group of Ministers, headed by the then Deputy Prime Minister of India Lal Krishna Advani. The Group of Ministers investigated intelligence lapses that occurred during the Kargil War and recommended a comprehensive reform of Indian intelligence agencies. The Defence Intelligence Agency was created and became operational in March 2002. As part of expanding bilateral co-operation on gathering intelligence and fighting terrorism, the United States military also provided advice to Indian military officers on the creation of the DIA.|$|R
