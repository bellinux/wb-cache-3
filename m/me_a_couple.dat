2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk.

[...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
