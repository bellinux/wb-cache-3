5|$|Donaldson {{was called}} {{up by the}} England National Game XI, who {{represent}} England at non-League level, for a European Challenge Trophy match against Belgium in November 2005. He was named in the initial 35-man squad for the Four Nations Tournament in May 2006, but {{did not make the}} final 18-man squad. Donaldson finally <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> when being named in the final 16-man squad for the team to play the Netherlands in November 2006. He made his debut in this match, coming on as a substitute in the last 15 minutes, in which he set up Craig Mackail-Smith for the final goal of a 4–1 victory. Donaldson was included in the squad to play Northern Ireland in February 2007, although York manager McEwan contemplated withdrawing Donaldson from the squad, after his comeback for York against Altrincham in February 2007. Donaldson eventually started against Northern Ireland, but was substituted after 50 minutes for Paul Benson, who scored England's only goal two minutes after coming on in a 3–1 defeat. This was the final of two caps he earned for England National Game XI.|$|E
5|$|The Denver Broncos {{selected}} Pastrana in {{the eleventh}} {{round of the}} 1969 NFL Draft with the 270th overall pick. In 1969, he saw action in two games and did not attempt a pass, but did have one reception for 15yards. The following season, he played in five games, including three as starter in relief of Steve Tensi, who had suffered a shoulder injury. Against the San Diego Chargers, Pastrana drove the team to the opposing 35-yard line and within field goal range, but he was knocked unconscious and could not call a crucial timeout. As the offensive captain, {{he was the only}} person authorized to do so under the rules at the time, and the clock expired to result in a 1717 stalemate. The rules regarding timeouts were changed after the season. In 1970, Pastrana completed 29of 75pass attempts for 420yards and one touchdown, rushed 14times for 89yards and one touchdown, threw nine interceptions, and was sacked eight times. Five of his interceptions came against the Kansas City Chiefs. Pastrana suffered a severe concussion that effectively ended his career {{near the end of the}} 1970 season and also heavily altered his personality. In the 1971 offseason, head coach Lou Saban held try-outs with seven quarterbacks. By the end of August, Pastrana <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> to the final three, alongside Don Horn and Steve Ramsey, and was the only quarterback remaining on the team from the prior season. Pastrana, however, was cut in early September.|$|E
