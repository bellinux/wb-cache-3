The results obtained from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>wire</b> with small helical anisotropy show that for lower frequencies (up to about 1 MHz), the presence of wall causes an increase in impedance, very probably due to the wall displacement. As frequency increases, the influence of the wall presence on the magnetic state causes the impedance to decrease in adjacent domains.

30|$|Here, we {{presented}} complete experimental details and {{results of the}} electrostatic complexation between cationic homoPEs and negatively charged superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. By using direct mixing method, we evidenced their ‘destabilization state’ at charges stoichiometry (isoelectric point) and ‘long-lived stable clusters state’ named arrested states apart of isoelectric point. Then, we applied the ‘desalting kinetic’ method to their complexation {{in the presence of}} an externally applied magnetic field (0.3 T). At isoelectric point, large and irregular aggregates with macroscopic sedimentation were obtained. Apart of isoelectric point (at arrested state), regular and elongated <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> can be obtained. By tuning charges ratio, we can also select the overall surface charge (either positive or negative) of these <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires.</b> Moreover, we derive the probability distribution function of wire length and study their mechanisms of reorientations under the application of a magnetic field.

30|$|We then {{investigated}} the dialysis of these salted dispersions of under an {{external magnetic field}} (B[*]=[*] 0.3 T) {{in order to produce}} one-dimensional <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires.</b> At isoelectric point, we obtained large aggregates of 100 μm with irregular morphologies, indicating the strong attractive interaction between homoPEs with charged NPs and their uncontrolled complexation. At Z[*]=[*] 0.3 and Z[*]=[*] 7, the straight and regular <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> were obtained, indicating that the extra polymer or particle charges can soften their strong attractive interaction. These wires can be either positively (obtained at Z[*]=[*] 0.3) or negatively (obtained at Z[*]=[*] 7) charged on surface. These homoPEs formed wires, as the wires made from PTEA 11 K-b- PAM 30 K copolymers, were rigid aggregates with superparamagnetic properties inherited from the single particles. We thus have shown that the previous copolymer-based co-assembly strategy could be generalized to strong and weak polyelectrolytes. In terms of cost and practicality, this represents a remarkable improvement. Beyond, the evident surface charges induced by the amine or carboxyl functions can not only enhance their colloidal stability but also facilitate their future functionalization. This simple and general approach opens significant perspectives for the design of multifunctional hybrid materials.|$|E

40|$|The magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} of thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> of {{iron and}} cobalt {{is quite different from}} the bulk phases. The spin moment of monatomic Fe wire may be as high as 3. 4 μB, while the orbital moment as high as 0. 5 μB. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) was calculated for wires up to 0. 6 nm in diameter starting from monatomic wire and adding consecutive shells for thicker wires. I observe that Fe wires exhibit the change sign with the stress applied along the wire. It means that easy axis may change from the direction along the wire to perpendicular to the wire. We find that ballistic conductance of the wire depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field, i. e. shows anisotropic ballistic magnetoresistance. This effect occurs due to the symmetry dependence of the splitting of degenerate bands in the applied field which changes the number of bands crossing the Fermi level. We find that the ballistic conductance changes with applied stress. Even for thicker wires the ballistic conductance changes by factor 2 on moderate tensile stain in our 5 × 4 model wire. Thus, the ballistic conductance of <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> changes in the applied field due to the magnetostriction. This effect can be observed as large anisotropic BMR in the experiment...|$|E
