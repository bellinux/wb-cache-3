5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the <b>mtDNA</b> include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its <b>mtDNA</b> from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale <b>mtDNA</b> rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in <b>mtDNA.</b>|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the <b>mtDNA</b> bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant <b>mtDNA</b> thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant <b>mtDNA,</b> leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of <b>mtDNA</b> molecules within the cell.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution and}} expression of mutant <b>mtDNAs</b> carrying the A-to-G mutation at position 8344 in the tRNA(Lys) gene in the skeletal muscle of four patients with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF). The proportion of mutant genomes was greater than 80 % of total <b>mtDNAs</b> in muscle samples of all patients and {{was associated with a}} decrease in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). The vast majority of myoblasts, cloned from the satellite-cell population in the same muscles, were homoplasmic for the mutation. The overall proportion of mutant <b>mtDNAs</b> in this population was similar to that in differentiated muscle, suggesting that the ratio of mutant to wild-type <b>mtDNAs</b> in skeletal muscle is determined either in the ovum or during early development and changes little with age. Translation of all mtDNA-encoded genes was severely depressed in homoplasmic mutant myoblast clones but not in heteroplasmic or wild-type clones. The threshold for biochemical expression of the mutation was determined in heteroplasmic myotubes formed by fusion of different proportions of mutant and wild-type myoblasts. The magnitude of the decrease in translation in myotubes containing mutant <b>mtDNAs</b> was protein specific. Complex I and IV subunits were more affected than complex V subunits, and there was a rough correlation with both protein size and number of lysine residues. Approximately 15 % wild-type <b>mtDNAs</b> restored translation and COX activity to near normal levels. These results show that the A-to-G substitution in tRNA(Lys) is a functionally recessive mutation that can be rescued by intraorganellar complementation with a small proportion of wild-type <b>mtDNAs</b> and explain the steep threshold for expression of the MERRF clinical phenotype...|$|R

The sample set collected from people {{who claimed to have}} a maternal ancestor with Native American physiognomic traits had a statistically significant higher frequency of Native American <b>mtDNAs</b> (69. 6 %) than did the unbiased sample set (52. 6 %). This higher frequency suggests that, {{despite the fact that the}} native Taíno culture has been extinct for centuries, the Taíno contribution to the current population is considerable and some of the Taíno physiognomic traits are still present. Native American haplogroup frequency analysis shows a highly structured distribution, suggesting that the contribution of Native Americans foreign to Puerto Rico is minimal. Haplogroups A and C cover 56. 0 % and 35. 6 % of the Native American <b>mtDNAs,</b> respectively. No haplogroup D <b>mtDNAs</b> were found. Most of the linguistic, biological, and cultural evidence suggests that the Ceramic culture of the Taínos originated in or close to the Yanomama territory in the Amazon.

40|$|A {{combination}} of restriction analysis and direct sequencing via the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) was used to build trees relating mitochondrial DNAs (<b>mtDNAs)</b> from 50 individuals belonging to five species of Australian babblers (Pomatostomus). The trees served as a quantitative framework for analyzing the direction and tempo of evolution of an intraspecific length polymorphism from a third mitochondrial ancestor. The length polymorphism lies between the cytochrome b and 12 S rRNA (srRNA) genes. Screening of <b>mtDNAs</b> within and between the five species with restriction enzymes showed that Pomatosomus temporalis was polymorphic for two smaller size classes (M and S) that are completely segregated geographically, whereas <b>mtDNAs</b> from the other four species were exclusively of a third, larger size (L). Inter- and intraspecific phylogenetic trees relating <b>mtDNAs</b> based on restriction maps, cytochrome b sequences obtained via PCR, and the two data sets combined were compared to one another statistically and were broadly similar except for the phylogenetic position of Pomatosomus halli. Both sets of phylogenies imply that only two deletion events can account for the observed intraspecific distribution of the three length types. High levels of base-substitutional divergence were detected within and between northern and southern lineages of P. temporalis, which implies {{a low level of}} gene flow between northern and southern regions as well as a low rate of length mutation.

40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondrial genomes {{provide a}} rich source of {{molecular}} variation of proven and widespread utility in molecular ecology, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The tapeworm genus Taenia includes a diversity of tapeworm parasites of significant human and veterinary importance. Here we add complete sequences of the mt genomes of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis, to a data set of 4 published <b>mtDNAs</b> in the same genus. Seven complete mt genomes of Taenia species are used to compare and contrast variation within and between genomes in the genus, to estimate a phylogeny for the genus, and to develop novel molecular markers as part of an extended mitochondrial toolkit. Results The complete circular <b>mtDNAs</b> of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis were 13, 693, 13, 492 and 13, 387 bp in size respectively, comprising the usual complement of flatworm genes. Start and stop codons of protein coding genes included those found commonly amongst other platyhelminth mt genomes, but the much rarer initiation codon GTT was inferred for the gene atp 6 in T. pisiformis. Phylogenetic analysis of <b>mtDNAs</b> offered novel estimates of the interrelationships of Taenia. Sliding window analyses showed nad 6, nad 5, atp 6, nad 3 and nad 2 are amongst the most variable of genes per unit length, with the highest peaks in nucleotide diversity found in nad 5. New primer pairs capable of amplifying fragments of variable DNA in nad 1, rrn S and nad 5 genes were designed in silico and tested as possible alternatives to existing mitochondrial markers for Taenia. Conclusions With the availability of complete <b>mtDNAs</b> of 7 Taenia species, we have shown that analysis of amino acids provides a robust estimate of phylogeny for the genus that differs markedly from morphological estimates or those using partial genes; with implications for understanding the evolutionary radiation of important Taenia. Full alignment of the nucleotides of Taenia <b>mtDNAs</b> and sliding window analysis suggests numerous alternative gene regions are likely to capture greater nucleotide variation than those currently pursued as molecular markers. New PCR primers developed from a comparative mitogenomic analysis of Taenia species, extend the use of mitochondrial markers for molecular ecology, population genetics and diagnostics. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{molecular}} basis of {{cytoplasmic male sterility}} (CMS) in sunflower (Helianthus annuus), we compared the physical organization and transcriptional properties of mitochondrial DNAs (<b>mtDNAs)</b> from isonuclear fertile and CMS lines. Mapping studies revealed much greater similarity between the two <b>mtDNAs</b> than in previous comparisons of fertile and CMS lines from other plant species. The two sunflower <b>mtDNAs</b> 1) are nearly identical in size (300 kb and 305 kb); 2) contain the same 12 kb recombination repeat and associated tripartite structure; 3) have the same dispersed distribution of mitochondrial genes and chloroplast DNA-homologous sequences; 4) are greater than 99. 9 % identical in primary sequence; and 5) are colinear over a contiguous region encompassing 94 % of the genome. Detectable alterations are limited to a 17 kb {{region of the genome}} and reflect as few as two mutations [...] a 12 kb inversion and a 5 kb insertion/deletion. One endpoint of both rearrangements is located within or near atpA, which is also the only mitochondrial gene whose transcripts differ between the fertile and CMS lines. Furthermore, a nuclear gene that restores fertility to CMS plants specifically influences the pattern of atpA transcripts. Rearrangements at the atpA locus may, therefore, be responsible for CMS in sunflower...|$|R

5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (<b>mtDNA)</b> is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage <b>mtDNA.</b> A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

The COI intron encodes a putative homing endonuclease, and the ND 5 intron contains the molecule's ND 1 and ND 3 genes. Most of the unusual characteristics of other metazoan <b>mtDNAs</b> are not found in M. senile mtDNA: unorthodox translation initiation codons and partial translation termination codons are absent, the use of TGA to specify tryptophan is the only genetic code modification, and both encoded tRNAs have primary and secondary structures closely resembling those of standard tRNAs. Also, with regard to size and secondary structure potential, the mt-s-rRNA and mt- 1 -rRNA have the least deviation from Escherichia coli 16 S and 23 S rRNAs of all known metazoan mt-rRNAs.

Variable mitochondrial sequences are potentially useful for evolutionary and taxonomic studies. We developed a molecular taxonomic marker by sequencing a highly-variable ~ 2 kb mitochondrial region, nad 5 -cox 1, from 36 populations of root-knot nematodes to elucidate relationships within the genus Meloidogyne.
