40|$|Abstract—Triage is {{of great}} {{interest}} in software projects because {{it has the potential}} to reduce developer effort by involving a broader base of non-developer contributors to filter and augment reported issues. Using issue tracking data and interviews with experienced contributors we investigate ways to quantify the impact of triagers on reducing the number of issues developers need to resolve in two OSS projects: Mozilla and Gnome. We find the primary impact of triagers to involve issue filtering, filling missing information, and determining the relevant product. While triagers were good at filtering invalid issues and as accurate as developers in filling in <b>missing</b> <b>issue</b> attributes, they had more difficulty accurately pinpointing the relevant product. We expect that this work will highlight the importance of issue triage in software projects and will help design further studies on understanding and improving triage practices. I...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, RFID {{technologies}} {{have been used}} in many applications, such as inventory checking and object tracking. However, raw RFID data are inherently unreliable due to physical device limitations and different kinds of environmental noise. Currently, existing work mainly focuses on RFID data cleansing in a static environment (e. g. inventory checking). It is therefore difficult to cleanse RFID data streams in a mobile environment (e. g. object tracking) using the existing solutions, which do not address the data <b>missing</b> <b>issue</b> effectively. In this paper, we study how to cleanse RFID data streams for object tracking, which is a challenging problem, since a significant percentage of readings are routinely dropped. We propose a probabilistic model for object tracking in a mobile environment. We develop a Bayesian inference based approach for cleansing RFID data using the model. In order to sample data from the movement distribution, we devise a sequential sampler that cleans RFID data with high accuracy and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our solution through extensive simulations and demonstrate its performance by using two real RFID applications of human tracking and conveyor belt monitoring. © 2012 ACM...|$|E

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} years, Greece has {{undergone}} several endeavors aimed at modernizing and improving {{national health care}} services {{with a focus on}} PHC. However, the extent to which integrated primary health care has been achieved is still questioned. Purpose: This paper explores the extent to which integrated primary health care (PHC) is an issue in the current agenda of policy makers in Greece, reporting constraints and opportunities and highlighting the need for a policy perspective in developing integrated PHC in this Southern European country. Methods: A systematic review in PubMed/Medline and SCOPUS, along with a hand search in selected Greek biomedical journals was undertaken to identify key papers, reports, editorials or opinion letters relevant to integrated health care. Results: Our systematic review identified 198 papers and 161 out of them were derived from electronic search. Fifty-three papers in total served the scope of this review and are shortly reported. A key finding is that the long-standing dominance of medical perspectives in Greek health policy has been paving the way towards vertical integration, pushing aside any discussions about horizontal or comprehensive integration of care. Conclusion: Establishment of integrated PHC in Greece is still at its infancy, requiring major restructuring of the current national health system, as well as organizational culture changes. Moving towards a new policy-based model would bring this <b>missing</b> <b>issue</b> on the discussion table, facilitating further development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis concludes my Master of Science in Business Studies and Computer Science at Roskilde University. Within {{the area}} of {{strategic}} use of IT, many organizations have realized the importance of IT governance, {{as well as the}} allocation of decision rights and accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in using IT. This is further acknowledged in the IT governance literature. However, even though IT governance literature on this topic has grown dramatically during the last decade, it has more or less neglected the importance of organizational context, namely in regards to explaining differences in IT governance decision arrangements among public and private service-oriented organizations. This thesis tries to shed more light on this <b>missing</b> <b>issue</b> in the literature by examining how IT governance is carried out in two specific cases of two IT organizations, one operating in public and other in the private Danish healthcare sector. The thesis especially focuses on how these contextual differences impact the organization in the public sector, because this sector is regarded as more complex. The theoretical foundation of the thesis is based on a specific IT governance theory, and additionally complemented with a general theory of strategic decision making in a public and private context. This is done {{in order to create a}} better understanding of possible contextual influences on an organization's decision arrangements regarding IT. Later on this theory is used as a ground element in the construction of the qualitative study of the two specific cases, where a comparative analysis of differences in the contextual influences on the two organization's IT governance plays a central role. The results show that contextual influences on IT governance indeed differ in the private and the public healthcare sector. Furthermore the results specifically point at various environmental factors, transactional factors and organizational processes, as the main reason for the apparent differences when it comes to IT governance decision arrangements in the organization that operates in the public sector. The results contribute not only by confirming the impact of factors already mentioned in decision making literature, but identifies a number of additional factors related to specifically IT governance that may have an impact on decision arrangements regarding IT in public service-sector organizations...|$|E
40|$|Family {{physician}} (FP) is a suggested {{model for}} controlling Iran health system challenges such as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental illnesses, and HIV-AIDS besides urbanization, and elderly issues. Although FP {{is a legal}} commitment, it faces several obstacles such as lack of infrastructure, diversity of insurances, and unwillingness of senior health policy makers about it. 1 As Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS) is a pilot center for implementation of FP model, the First International Conference on Family Physician with participation of Health Policy Research Center (HPRC) was conducted successfully on 27 th and 28 th of December 2015 in Shiraz, Iran. The main goal of this conference was developing the discourse of FP with these major subjects: ‘the philosophy of FP’, ‘FP and medical education’, ‘FP and universal health coverage’, ‘incentive and financial system in FP’, and ‘evaluation of the international, national and provincial experiences in FP’. Despite presenting interesting topics in the conference, the main <b>missing</b> <b>issue</b> was the role of nursing, specifically nursing practitioner (NP), in the conference. Experiences of other countries revealed that NP has {{an important role in}} primary health care (PHC), 2, 3 quality of care, 3 diagnosis and treatment 4 in healthcare system. Moreover, International Council of Nursing believed that nursing can be effective for universal health coverage and being cost-effective in health care delivery. 5 However, none of the nursing scholars and nursing managers actively participated in this conference. With respect to recent great changes in health care system in Iran, problem is not limited to this conference. Absence of community based approaches in nursing is obvious in three major health policies recently approved in Iran; they include establishing FP project in two provinces (Fars and Mazandaran) as pilot, making urban community health centers (UCHC) or Comprehensive Health Center in big cities 6 and Health Sector Evolution Plan (HSEP). However, the main parts of these programs are related to PHC which needs community based approaches, but there was no any active participation of nursing groups, theoretically and practically. Sometimes the ignorance of nursing position is very precise. For instance, in the conference, it was remarked that FP’s assistant will be trained on January 2016 in SUMS. Whereas Behvarz, as the most familiar discipline with nursing, has had a brilliant role in the last rural primary health care in Iran, the main question is that “Who can be better than educated nursing staff as FP’s assistant?” Although ignorance of nursing position is related to approaches of policy makers, passivity of nursing scholars and nursing managers amplifies the problem. There is a big gap between policy makers and nursing on one hand and nursing scholars and nursing managers on the other hand. In this situation, nursing groups should be more sensitive to new changes such as FP, UCHC and HSEP theoretically and practically for promoting health in the community with preventive and consultative functions of NP. This approach not only helps to establish the real position of nursing but also can decrease the health system costs. This claim surely needs a clear plan. Therefore, teaching nurses according to community-based approaches, interaction between faculty of nursing and community, and conducting surveys seem necessary. Additionally, division of labor in health care system is a focal point for assigning some duties to NPs. Implementation of this idea can practically lead to repetition of the last position of Behvarz for the new generation of nursing in Iran. Today, Iran healthcare system has faced increasing costs due to changes in the patterns of illnesses, prevalence of NCDs and other mentioned problems. Utilization of expert NPs is an approach for declining the effects of such problems. Although policies ignore community- based functions in nursing, {{it is the responsibility of}} nursing scholars and nursing managers to regenerate their position in major changes. ...|$|E
