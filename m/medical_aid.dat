Bullock proposed that the matter be dropped, but Bibb insisted that Chambers would have to retract his challenge, to which Bullock would not consent. The duel was held February 3, 1801, near Bardstown. Both combatants missed with their first shots. Both men fired again, and Rowan's second shot struck Chambers, wounding him severely. (Bibb's account says that Chambers was struck in the left side; other accounts state that the shot hit Chambers in the chest.) Rowan then offered his carriage to take Chambers to town for medical attention, and Chambers asked that Rowan not be prosecuted. Despite <b>medical</b> <b>aid,</b> Chambers died the following day.|$|E
5|$|By {{two days}} after the storm, the {{government}} of Mexico sent two airplanes to Acapulco, where the food, clothing, and medicine were distributed by truck or helicopter to the affected areas. The Mexican government arranged plans to drop food and <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> into isolated villages, although food supplies were initially insufficient for the great number of people affected by the storm. Five army units and three helicopters were sent to the region to assist in the aftermath, although planes encountered difficulties in landing due to flooded runways. Army soldiers were responsible for rescue operations, while paratroopers were sent to the most affected areas to distribute aid. Despite fears of the spread of disease in the aftermath, prompt work by medical officials prevented any epidemics due to the storm.|$|E

5|$|HMS Fife (a Royal Navy County Class Destroyer) {{was on its}} {{way back}} to the United Kingdom when the {{hurricane}} struck, and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas The Fife docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance.

5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base.

5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de Secours (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief materials {{for at least}} 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and <b>medical</b> <b>aid.</b> The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha.

5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free <b>medical</b> <b>aid.</b> Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame says he did not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.|$|E

Her treatment and forced incarceration in the asylum has remained of interest {{with respect to}} the rights of psychiatric patients; Dr Arthur Stillwell, the presiding physician, made notes on Louisa's condition and treatment, recorded in The Lancet. Louisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square, but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. In 1860 Louisa's brother, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that Louisa had given him {{as a result of his}} undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860).

He maneuvered his platoon over unfamiliar terrain in the face of hostile fire and placed his men in fighting positions. With his unit pinned down when the outpost was attacked under cover of darkness by an estimated force of two enemy battalions supported by mortar and artillery fire, he deliberately exposed himself to the heavy barrage and attacks to direct his men in defending their positions and personally supervise the treatment and evacuation of the wounded. Inspired by his leadership, the platoon quickly rallied and engaged the enemy force in fierce hand-to-hand combat.

40|$|Abstract: Long bone non-unions {{may lead}} to {{recurrent}} surgical procedures and in-hospital stays. Thus, restrictions of the health-related {{quality of life and}} of socioeconomic parameters might be expected. Knowledge of the impact on several parameters of professional life is sparse. Therefore, we analyzed the outcome in patients following non-unions of the tibial and femoral shaft after fracture compared to patients with uneventful healing. Material and Methodology: 51 patients following non-unions of the the femoral (FNU) or tibial shaft (TNU) were compared to 51 patients (groups FH and TH) with uneventful fracture healing. Physical and mental health was assessed using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). We also analyzed employment status and the usage of <b>medical</b> <b>aids.</b> Results: Scores of the SF- 12 physical and psychological were lower in group TNU compared to group TH, the score of SF- 12 physical but not psychological was significantly lower in group FNU compared to FH. Compared to uneventful healing, a significantly more frequent usage of <b>medical</b> <b>aids</b> was found in both non-union groups. A higher incidence of early retirement and unemployment was found in group FNU but not in group TNU. Conclusions: There is a profound influence on the quality of life following femoral or tibial non-unions after trauma. Compared to patients with uneventful fracture healing, patients with tibial and even more so femoral non-union show worse scores of the SF- 12. <b>Medical</b> <b>aids</b> are frequently used following both, femoral and tibial non-unions. Not tibial, but femoral non-unions frequently lead to severe restrictions in professional life such as early retirement and unemployment.
