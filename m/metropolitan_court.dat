The lawyers wanted to meet the accused alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did {{not allow them to}} meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they were talking to the accused. The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the accused. He is said to have hinted at collusion between the lawyers and the accused, causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers. The next day, in two different cases, the designated <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>Court</b> remanded all the 26 accused to police custody till 31 October.|$|E
