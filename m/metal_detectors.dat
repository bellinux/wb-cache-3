5|$|In April 2015, <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> were {{installed}} {{as a permanent}} fixture to the entrance. The attraction officially had <b>metal</b> <b>detectors,</b> security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, {{anything that could be}} placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to be absolutely empty prior to boarding. Persons in violation would be sent to the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> {{were added}} to the gates and {{security}} was doubled after a person was killed in a shooting during a crowded Mother's Day. It happened after two visitors were involved in a fight, apparently over a drug exchange before their visit to the park.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> to diagnose swallowed radio-opaque metal foreign bodies (MFBs) in children, {{and whether they}} can detect non-radio-opaque MFBs. METHODS: In a prospective study, 231 children, who presented to the {{accident and emergency department}} with a history of swallowing MFBs, were evaluated by the <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> as well as radiography to confirm and locate {{the presence or absence of}} MFBs. RESULTS: A definite history of swallowing a MFB by the child was given by 186 (81 %) parents. The <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> located MFBs in 183 children and radiographs confirmed radio-opaque MFBs in 181. In the remaining 45 (19 %), when swallowing was suspected and not definite, both <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> and radiography confirmed the presence of a MFB in only four. CONCLUSION: A high detection rate of swallowed MFBs was observed in this study, using a <b>metal</b> <b>detector.</b> It is also of value to detect non-radio-opaque MFBs like aluminium. The detection of MFBs is high when the history of swallowing is definite...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable <b>metal</b> <b>detectors.</b> Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E
5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using <b>metal</b> <b>detectors.</b> The hoard may be worth up to Â£10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as <b>metal</b> <b>detectors,</b> provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to <b>metal</b> <b>detectors,</b> X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover every nook and corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations.|$|E
