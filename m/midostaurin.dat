Mutation of the internal tandem duplication (ITD) region of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT 3) is considered high risk for decreased response and overall survival. <b>Midostaurin</b> is a Type III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor found to inhibit FLT 3 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, src, c-kit, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. In preclinical studies, <b>midostaurin</b> exhibited broad-spectrum antitumor activity toward a wide range of tumor xenografts, as well as an FLT 3 -ITD-driven mouse model of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). <b>Midostaurin</b> is orally administered and generally well tolerated as a single agent; hematologic toxicity increases substantially when administered in combination with standard induction chemotherapy. Clinical trials primarily have focused on relapsed/refractory AML and MDS and included single- and combination-agent studies. Administration of <b>midostaurin</b> to relapsed/refractory MDS and AML patients confers a robust anti-blast response sufficient to bridge a minority of patients to transplant. In combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, responses appear comparable to historic controls, while the addition of <b>midostaurin</b> to standard induction chemotherapy may prolong survival in FLT 3 -ITD mutant patients. The response of some wild-type (WT) -FLT 3 patients to <b>midostaurin</b> therapy is consistent with midostaurin&# 39;s ability to inhibit WT-FLT 3 in vitro, and also may reflect overexpression of WT-FLT 3 in those patients and/or off-target effects such as inhibition of kinases other than FLT 3. <b>Midostaurin</b> represents a well-tolerated, easily administered oral agent with the potential to bridge mutant and WT-FLT 3 AML patients to transplant and possibly deepen response to induction chemotherapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with acute}} myeloid leukemia (AML) and a FLT 3 {{mutation}} have poor outcomes. We conducted a phase 3 trial {{to determine whether the}} addition of <b>midostaurin</b> - an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that is active in patients with a FLT 3 mutation - to standard chemotherapy would prolong overall survival in this population. METHODS: We screened 3277 patients, 18 to 59 years of age, who had newly diagnosed AML for FLT 3 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine and consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine) plus either <b>midostaurin</b> or placebo; those who were in remission after consolidation therapy entered a maintenance phase in which they received either <b>midostaurin</b> or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to subtype of FLT 3 mutation: point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation with either a high ratio (> 0. 7) or a low ratio (0. 05 to 0. 7) of mutant to wild-type alleles (ITD [high] and ITD [low], respectively). Allogeneic transplantation was allowed. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients underwent randomization; 360 were assigned to the <b>midostaurin</b> group, and 357 to the placebo group. The FLT 3 subtype was ITD (high) in 214 patients, ITD (low) in 341 patients, and TKD in 162 patients. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, race, FLT 3 subtype, cytogenetic risk, and blood counts but not with respect to sex (51. 7 % in the <b>midostaurin</b> group vs. 59. 4 % in the placebo group were women, P= 0. 04). Overall survival was significantly longer in the <b>midostaurin</b> group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0. 78; one-sided P= 0. 009), as was event-free survival (hazard ratio for event or death, 0. 78; one-sided P= 0. 002). In both the primary analysis and an analysis in which data for patients who underwent transplantation were censored, the benefit of <b>midostaurin</b> was consistent across all FLT 3 subtypes. The rate of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor <b>midostaurin</b> to standard chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall and event-free survival among patients with AML and a FLT 3 mutation.

In contrast, the present study demonstrates that an eNOS gene expression-enhancing compound with additional protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitory properties can upregulate eNOS while preserving its enzymatic function. Apolipoprotein E-knockout mice were treated for 7 days with <b>midostaurin</b> (4 '-N-benzoyl staurosporine, compound CGP 41251, 50 - 125 mg/kg/day), a PKC inhibitor previously shown to increase eNOS expression and NO production in cultured human endothelial cells. <b>Midostaurin</b> treatment enhanced eNOS mRNA expression (RNase protection assay) in mouse aorta, kidney, and heart in a dose-dependent fashion.

40|$|Several {{protein kinase}} inhibitors {{are known to}} be mechanism-based inhibitors of {{cytochrome}} P 450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP 3 A 4. Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP enzymes by a drug may have long lasting and serious consequences due to the irreversible nature of the inhibition. The CYP enzyme must be resynthesized before regaining functionality, affecting the concentrations of other drugs metabolized by the same CYP enzymes and potentially leading to drug-drug interactions. Six protein kinase inhibitors were tested for mechanism-based inhibition of CYP 2 C 8 and CYP 3 A 4 using human liver microsomes; masitinib, <b>midostaurin,</b> nintedanib, quizartinib, trametinib and vatalanib. Amodiaquine was used as the substrate for CYP 2 C 8, while midazolam was the CYP 3 A 4 substrate. None of the inhibitors tested displayed time-dependent inhibition of CYP 2 C 8. <b>Midostaurin</b> and nintedanib exhibited time-dependent inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 while masitinib, quizartinib, trametinib and vatalanib did not. Both <b>midostaurin</b> and nintedanib had an inhibitor concentration causing a 50 % inhibition (IC 50) shift of > 1. 5 -fold with increased inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 after preincubation with NADPH for 30 minutes when compared to no preincubation. The mechanism-based inactivation constants kinact (the maximal inactivation rate) and KI (the inhibitor concentration that supports half-maximal rate of inactivation) were determined for <b>midostaurin</b> and nintedanib. The kinact values were 0. 053 1 /min for <b>midostaurin</b> and 0. 024 1 /min for nintedanib, while the KI values were 2. 65 µM for <b>midostaurin</b> and 16. 5 µM for nintedanib. Predictions using a mechanistic static model suggested that nintedanib is unlikely to cause CYP 3 A 4 mediated drug-drug interactions, while <b>midostaurin</b> was predicted to increase the exposure of CYP 3 A 4 substrates by several times. Reversible inhibition by trametinib is unlikely to cause drug-drug interactions involving either CYP 2 C 8 or CYP 3 A 4 substrates.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} examine the {{hypothesis}} that a pharmacologic up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) combined with a reversal of eNOS uncoupling provides a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. BackgroundMany cardiovascular diseases are associated with oxidant stress involving protein kinase C (PKC) and uncoupling of eNOS. MethodsMessenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was analyzed with RNase protection assay or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, vascular nitric oxide (NO) with spin trapping, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with dihydroethidium fluorescence. ResultsAortas of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) showed an elevated production of ROS when compared with aortas of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The aortic expression of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) oxidase subunits (Nox 1, Nox 2, Nox 4, and p 22 phox) was higher in SHR compared with WKY. In SHR, aortic production of ROS was reduced by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), indicating eNOS “uncoupling” in hypertension. Oral treatment with the PKC inhibitor <b>midostaurin</b> reduced aortic Nox 1 expression, diminished ROS production, and reversed eNOS uncoupling in SHR. Aortic levels of (6 R) - 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH 4) were significantly reduced in SHR compared with WKY. <b>Midostaurin</b> normalized BH 4 levels in SHR. In both WKY and SHR, <b>midostaurin</b> increased aortic expression of eNOS mRNA and protein, stimulated bioactive NO production, and enhanced relaxation of the aorta to acetylcholine. <b>Midostaurin</b> lowered blood pressure in SHR and, to a lesser extent, in WKY; the compound did not change blood pressure in WKY made hypertensive with L-NAME.

Second, a sponsor-initiated, multicenter, single-arm open Phase II study (CPKC 412 D 2201) confirmed a high and durable ORR of 60 % including 45 % of MR among 89 AdSM patients. Finally, a French compassionate use program managed by the French Reference Centre for Mastocytosis allowed the treatment of almost a hundred AdSM patients to date in France since the CPKC 412 D 2201 study closure. The outcome of the first 28 treated patients under cover of this on-going procedure revealed an ORR of 71 % including 57 % of MR. Most importantly, survival analysis revealed in comparison to a historical control cohort of AdSM patients who did not receive <b>midostaurin</b> a twofold lower risk of death (p= 0. 02) in midostaurin-treated patients. Side effects revealed were acceptable and manageable (mostly digestive). <b>Midostaurin</b> appears to be an effective and safe treatment of AdSM. However, its effect on the course of the AHNMD is less clear. For the future, combined therapy (hypomethylating agents, cladribine, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, chemotherapy, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) may further improve long-term survival, particularly that of MCL and AdSM patients with AHNMD.

40|$|BACKGROUND Advanced {{systemic}} mastocytosis comprises rare hematologic neoplasms {{that are associated}} with a poor prognosis and lack effective treatment options. The multikinase inhibitor <b>midostaurin</b> inhibits KIT D 816 V, a primary driver of disease pathogenesis. METHODS We conducted an open-label study of oral <b>midostaurin</b> at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in 116 patients, of whom 89 with mastocytosis-related organ damage were eligible for inclusion in the primary efficacy population; 16 had aggressive {{systemic mastocytosis}}, 57 had systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and 16 had mast-cell leukemia. The primary outcome was the best overall response. RESULTS The overall response rate was 60 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 49 to 70); 45 % of the patients had a major response, which was defined as complete resolution of at least one type of mastocytosis-related organ damage. Response rates were similar regardless of the subtype of advanced systemic mastocytosis, KIT mutation status, or exposure to previous therapy. The median best percentage changes in bone marrow mast-cell burden and serum tryptase level were - 59 % and - 58 %, respectively. The median overall survival was 28. 7 months, and the median progression-free survival was 14. 1 months. Among the 16 patients with mast-cell leukemia, the median overall survival was 9. 4 months (95 % CI, 7. 5 to not estimated). Dose reduction owing to toxic effects occurred in 56 % of the patients; re-escalation to the starting dose was feasible in 32 % of those patients. The most frequent adverse events were low-grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. New or worsening grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 24 %, 41 %, and 29 % of the patients, respectively, mostly in those with preexisting cytopenias. CONCLUSIONS In this open-label study, <b>midostaurin</b> showed efficacy in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including the highly fatal variant mast-cell leukemia...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 78 - 82. Breast {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of death worldwide from cancer due to complications with its diagnosis and resistance to therapy. Recent studies have shown that breast tumors when compared with other solid tumors also contain a subpopulation termed as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are hard to kill due to their therapy resistant capacities. These unharmed cells then result into relapse of tumor after treatment. Some established breast cancer cell lines also behave in similar fashion to CSCs in overall manner thus termed as CSC like cell lines. This study primarily focuses on characterizing CSC like cell lines from non CSC like cell lines based upon their gene expression and prediction of drugs which can target these groups separately. In this study two databases, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Genome Project (CGP), were used which contain gene expression data and drugs cytotoxicity data for most of the established cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell lines gene expression data was used to predict two gene lists which can separate breast cancer cell lines into CSC like and non CSC like cell lines by in silico analysis. These gene lists were named as Patentable and Non Patentable. Additionally four drugs were predicted which can target CSC like group (<b>Midostaurin</b> and Elesclomol) and non CSC like group (Panobinostat and Lapatinib) separately. Later these findings were validated in vitro. Non Patentable gene list could not be validated due to low concordance with microarray data. On the other hand, Patentable gene list was validated and was found concordant with microarray data. Out of four selected drugs, Panobinostat and Lapatinib showed increased toxicity to non CSC like cell lines while only <b>Midostaurin</b> showed toxicity to CSC like cell lines. To investigate further that cell lines were grown in 3 D cell culture conditions, to increase their stem cell like properties (stemness). But only one cell line MDA-MB- 157 which was found as CSC like, showed expected behavior. Additionally this cell line increased resistance to Lapatinib and Panobinostat and became more sensitive to <b>Midostaurin.</b> Correlation analysis showed some genes as potential biomarkers for selected drugs. In conclusion, in this study various genes are proposed to differentiate CSC like cell lines from non CSC like cell lines. And <b>Midostaurin</b> can be potential drug to treat CSC like cells while Lapatinib and Panobinostat showed increased activity against non CSC like cell lines. Akbar, Muhammad WaqasM. S...|$|E
40|$|FLT 3 kinase {{has become}} an {{attractive}} drug target in AML with up to 30 % of cases harboring internal-tandem-duplication (ITD) mutations. For these, conferring a worse prognosis and decreased overall survival, several FLT 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently being tested in clinical trials. However, when using these drugs as monotherapy, the problem of short duration of remissions and high incidence of TKI resistance has emerged. Here, we investigated two members of a novel class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3, 4 -diarylmaleimides, for their efficacy on mutated FLT 3 kinase. These compounds inhibit FLT 3 kinase in an ATP-competitive manner and effectively inhibit phosphorylation of downstream targets. 3, 4 -Diarylmaleimides (DHF 125 and 150) induce apoptosis in FLT 3 -ITD-dependent cells lines and patient blasts at low micromolar concentrations. They are retained in the cytoplasm of exposed cells for more than 24 h and synergize with chemotherapy and <b>midostaurin.</b> Both 3, 4 -diarylmaleimides show inhbition of FLT 3 -ITD-related kinase autophosphorylation at distinct tyrosine residues when compared to <b>midostaurin.</b> In conclusion, this novel group of compounds shows differential inhibition patterns with regard to FLT 3 kinase and displays a promising profile for further clinical development.

30|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) {{is one of}} the most common and deadly leukemias {{worldwide}} [1 – 3]. Its prognosis is poor, and a large number of AML cases will relapse after initial healing. Clinicians currently use the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT 3) inhibitors such as lestaurtinib, <b>midostaurin,</b> sorafenib, and quizartinib for AML therapy [4 – 6]. But the administration of these drugs systemically is associated with high toxicity and severe side effects [7 – 9].

40|$|Objectives: Clinical {{responses}} {{achieved with}} FLT 3 kinase inhibitors in {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) are typically transient and partial. Thus, {{there is a need}} for identification of molecular mechanisms of clinical resistance to these drugs. In response, we characterized MOLM 13 AML cell lines made resistant to two structurally-independent FLT 3 inhibitors. Methods: MOLM 13 cells were made drug resistant via prolonged exposure to <b>midostaurin</b> and HG- 7 - 85 - 01, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. Cycloheximide was used to determine protein half-life. RT-PCR was performed to determine FLT 3 mRNA levels, and FISH analysis was performed to determine FLT 3 gene expression. Results and Conclusions: We found that MOLM 13 cells readily developed cross-resistance when exposed to either <b>midostaurin</b> or HG- 7 - 85 - 01. Resistance in both lines was associated with dramatically elevated levels of cell surface FLT 3 and elevated levels of phosphor-MAPK, but not phospho-STAT 5. The increase in FLT 3 -ITD expression was at least in part due to reduced turnover of the receptor, with prolonged half-life. Importantly, the drug-resistant phenotype could be rapidly reversed upon withdrawal of either inhibitor. Consistent with this phenotype, no significant evidence of FLT 3 gene amplification, kinase domain mutations, or elevated levels of mRNA was observed, suggesting that protein turnover may be part of an auto-regulatory pathway initiated by FLT 3 kinase activity. Interestingly, FLT 3 inhibitor resistance also correlate...|$|E

40|$|Mast cell leukemia {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} {{advanced}} systemic mastocytosis characterized by ≥ 20 % mast cells in a bone marrow smear. We evaluated clinical and molecular characteristics of 28 patients with (n= 20, 71 %) or without an associated hematologic neoplasm. De novo mast cell leukemia was diagnosed in 16 / 28 (57 %) patients and secondary mast cell leukemia evolving from other advanced systemic mastocytosis subtypes in 12 / 28 (43 %) patients, of which 7 patients progressed while on cytoreductive treatment. Median bone marrow mast cell infiltration was 65 % and median serum tryptase was 565 microg/L. C-findings were identified in 26 / 28 (93 %) patients. Mutations in KIT (D 816 V, n= 19; D 816 H/Y, n= 5; F 522 C, n= 1) were detected in 25 / 28 (89 %) patients and prognostically relevant additional mutations in SRSF 2, ASXL 1 or RUNX 1 (S/A/Rpos) in 13 / 25 (52 %) patients. Overall response rate in 18 treatment-naive patients was 5 / 12 (42 %) on <b>midostaurin</b> and 1 / 6 (17 %) on cladribine, and after switch 1 / 4 (25 %) on <b>midostaurin</b> and 0 / 3 on cladribine, respectively. S/A/Rpos adversely affected response to treatment and progression to secondary mast cell leukemia (n= 6) or acute myeloid leukemia (n= 3) while on treatment (P< 0. 05). The median overall survival from mast cell leukemia diagnosis was 17 months as compared to 44 months in a control group of 124 patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis but without mast cell leukemia (P= 0. 03). In multivariate analyses, S/A/Rpos remained the only independent poor prognostic variable predicting overall survival (P= 0. 007).
