The tested gas hydrates occur in two primary horizons; an upper zone, (“D ” Unit) containing 14 meters of gas hydrate-bearing sands and a lower zone (“C ” Unit), containing 16 meters of gas hydrate-bearing sands with log-interpreted gas hydrate saturations of 60 to 75 percent.

The contents of <b>methane</b> <b>range</b> 97. 22 %– 98. 41 %, with a little amount of ethane and propane, an average wetness of 0. 74 %, and little amount of non-hydrocarbons such as CO 2, N 2, H 2, however, there's no H 2 S. The carbon isotopes of methane, ethane, and propane are characterized by their complete isotopic reversal (δ 13 C 1  > δ 13 C 2  > δ 13 C 3). The natural gas from the Wufeng–Longmaxi Formation comes from the source rocks of the same formation, it classifies as a typical shale gas. According to the statistical determination criterion, natural gas in the Jiaoshiba area {{is derived from the}} sapropelic source rocks, which is a result of high-temperature pyrolysis. It is the product of mixing primary kerogen pyrolysis and secondary pyrolysis of crude oil, with apparent features of secondary pyrolysis of oil. The reason for the complete carbon isotopic reversal is the mixing of the two aforementioned gasses. Moreover, it has some sort of relationship with the loss function of shale gas after the Late Yanshan...|$|E
40|$|Although hydrocarbon-bearing fluids {{have been}} known from the {{alkaline}} igneous rocks of the Khibiny intrusion for many years, their origin remains enigmatic. A recently proposed model of post-magmatic HC generation through Fischer-Tropsch type reactions suggests a primary CO 2 fluid. This hypothesis is based upon textural data, gas bulk and isotopic composition and low entrapment temperature of fluid inclusions that indicate an abiogenic origin for the HC gases. However, new petrographic, microthermometric, laser Raman, bulk gas and isotope data are presented and discussed {{in the context of}} previously published work in order to reassess models of HC generation. The gas phase is dominated by CH 4 with only minor proportions of higher hydrocarbons. No remnants of the proposed primary CO 2 -rich fluid are found anywhere in the complex. Primary and secondary fluid inclusions show similar compositions and entrapment conditions. The majority of the fluid inclusions are of secondary nature and trapped in healed microfractures. This indicates a high fluid flux after magma crystallisation. Entrapment condtions for primary fluid inclusions are 450 - 550 °C at 2. 8 - 4. 5 kbar. These temperatures are too high for HC gas generation through the FT reaction. Chemical analyses of rims of Fe-rich phases suggest that they are not the result of alteration but instead represent changes in magma composition during crystallisation. Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between the presence of Fe-rich minerals and fluid inclusion abundance as reported elsewhere. Fluid inclusion planes generally start and terminate at mineral boundaries. δ 13 C values for <b>methane</b> <b>range</b> from – 22. 4 to - 5. 4 ‰, confirming also an abiogenic origin for the gas. These data support an abiogenic HC origin, but are not consistent with a post-magmatic FT-type reaction. The presence of primary CH 4 -dominated fluid and melt inclusions, which contain a methane-rich gas phase, indicate that a magmatic origin is more likely. An increase in methane content, together with a decrease in δ 13 C isotope values towards the intrusion margin suggest that magmatically derived abiogenic hydrocarbons may have mixed with biogenic hydrocarbons derived from the surrounding country rocks...|$|E

This study has been directed towards the development of computer models to simulate and analyse the gas flows in <b>methane</b> drainage <b>ranges</b> and the airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the conventional techniques of methane drainage currently employed and the mathematical approach used to model gas flow in the <b>methane</b> drainage <b>range.</b> It also discusses how, when combined with measured underground data, predicted results can be used to assess the performance of the range. Subsequent analysis techniques will suggest measures that can be undertaken to optimise this performance and assess the effect of selective network reconfiguration. The second part of the thesis includes a discussion of the increasing application of booster fans in U. K. underground coal mines and a critical analysis of the mathematical methods used to model airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. One particular method was adopted in a simulation model used to analyse networks with booster fans and specified face airflows. Both simulation models developed have been used to analyse representative underground <b>methane</b> drainage <b>ranges</b> and mine ventilation networks. The thesis concludes that the accuracy of the methane drainage models can only be guaranteed when developed in conjunction with suitable measured data. The mine ventilation model requires user guidance through the solution and analysis procedure. Results are presented in a simple graphical manner and this approach, rather than the 'black box' non interactive approach, is to be favoured in the analysis of mine ventilation networks...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the coal-bed methane {{potential}} of the Zonguldak basin have indicated that the gases are thermogenic and sourced by the coal-bearing Carboniferous units. In this earlier work, the origin of coal-bed gas was only defined according to the molecular composition of gases and to organic geochemical properties of the respective source rocks, since data on isotopic composition of gases were not available. Furthermore, in the western Black Sea region there also exist other source rocks, which {{may have contributed to}} the coal-bed gas accumulations. The aim of this study is to determine the origin of coal-bed gas and to try a gas-source rock correlation. For this purpose, the molecular and isotopic compositions of 13 headspace gases from coals and adjacent sediments of two wells in the Amasra region have been analyzed. Total organic carbon (TOC) measurements and Rock-Eval pyrolysis were performed in order to characterize the respective source rocks. Coals and sediments are bearing humic type organic matter, which have hydrogen indices (HI) of up to 300 mgHC/gTOC, indicating a certain content of liptinitic material. The stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13) C) of the kerogen vary from - 23. 1 to - 27. 7 parts per thousand. Air-free calculated gases contain hydrocarbons up to C- 5, carbon dioxide (98 %). The stable carbon isotope ratios of methane, ethane and propane are defined as delta(13) C(1) : - 51. 1 to - 48. 3 parts per thousand, delta(13) C(2) : - 37. 9 to - 25. 3 parts per thousand, delta(13) C(3) : - 26. 0 to - 19. 2 parts per thousand, respectively. The deltaD(1) values of <b>methane</b> <b>range</b> from - 190 to - 178 parts per thousand. According to its isotopic composition, methane is a mixture, partly generated bacterially, partly thermogenic. Molecular and isotopic composition of the gases and organic geochemical properties of possible source rocks indicate that the thermogenic gas generation took place in coals and organic rich shales of the Westphalian-A Kozlu formation. The bacterial input can be related to a primary bacterial methane generation during Carboniferous and/or to a recent secondary bacterial methane generation. However, some peculiarities of respective isotope values of headspace gases can also be related to the desorption process, which took place by sampling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The Australian sheep {{industry}} aims {{to increase}} the efficiency of sheep production by decreasing the amount of feed eaten by sheep. Also, feed intake is related to methane production, and more efficient (low residual feed intake) animals eat less than expected. So we tested the hypothesis that more efficient sheep produce less methane by investigating the genetic correlations between feed intake, residual feed intake, methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Feed intake, methane, oxygen, and carbon dioxide were measured on Merino ewes at postweaning (1, 866 at 223 d old), hogget (1, 010 sheep at 607 d old), and adult ages (444 sheep at 1, 080 d old). Sheep were fed a high-energy grower pellet ad libitum for 35 d. Individual feed intake was measured using automated feeders. Methane was measured using portable accumulation chambers up to 3 times during this feed intake period. Heritabilities and phenotypic and genotypic correlations between traits were estimated using ASReml. Oxygen (range 0. 10 to 0. 20) and carbon dioxide (range 0. 08 to 0. 28) were generally more heritable than <b>methane</b> (<b>range</b> 0. 11 to 0. 14). Selecting to decrease feed intake or residual feed intake will decrease methane (genetic correlation [rg] range 0. 76 to 0. 90) and carbon dioxide (rg range 0. 65 to 0. 96). Selecting to decrease intake (rg range 0. 64 to 0. 78) and methane (rg range 0. 81 to 0. 86) in sheep at postweaning age would also decrease intake and methane in hoggets and adults. Furthermore, selecting for lower residual feed intake (rg = 0. 75) and carbon dioxide (rg = 0. 90) in hoggets would also decrease these traits in adults. Similarly, selecting for higher oxygen (rg = 0. 69) in hoggets would also increase this trait in adults. Given these results, the hypothesis that making sheep more feed efficient will decrease their methane production can be accepted. In addition, carbon dioxide is a good indicator trait for feed intake because it has the highest heritability of the gas traits measured; is cheaper, faster, and easier to measure than feed intake and has strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with feed intake. Furthermore, selection for feed intake, feed efficiency, methane, and carbon dioxide can be done early in sheep at postweaning age or hoggets. This early selection reduces the generation interval for breeding, thereby increasing response to selection...|$|E
40|$|The oceanographic and tectonic {{conditions}} of accretionary margins are well-suited for several potential processes governing methane generation, storage and release. To identify the relevant methane evolution pathways {{in the northern}} Cascadia accretionary margin, a four-site transect was drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 311. The d 13 C values of <b>methane</b> <b>range</b> from a minimum value of - 82. 2 per mil on an uplifted ridge of accreted sediment near the deformation front (Site U 1326, 1829 mbsl, meters below sea level) to a maximum value of - 39. 5 per mil at the most landward location within an area of steep canyons near the shelf edge (Site U 1329, 946 mbsl). An interpretation based solely on methane isotope values might conclude the 13 C-enrichment of methane indicates a transition from microbially- to thermogenically-sourced methane. However, the co-existing CO 2 exhibits a similar trend of 13 C-enrichment along the transect with values ranging from - 22. 5 per mil to + 25. 7 per mil. The magnitude of the carbon isotope separation between methane and CO 2 (Ec = 63. 8 ± 5. 8) is consistent with isotope fractionation during microbially mediated carbonate reduction. These results, {{in conjunction with a}} transect-wide gaseous hydrocarbon content composed of > 99. 8 % (by volume) methane and uniform dDCH 4 values (- 172 per mil ± 8) that are distinct from thermogenic methane at a seep located 60 km from the Expedition 311 transect, suggest microbial CO 2 reduction is the predominant methane source at all investigated sites. The magnitude of the intra-site downhole 13 C-enrichment of CO 2 within the accreted ridge (Site U 1326) and a slope basin nearest the deformation front (Site U 1325, 2195 mbsl) is ~ 5 per mil. At the mid-slope site (Site U 1327, 1304 mbsl) the downhole 13 C-enrichment of the CO 2 is ~ 25 per mil and increases to ~ 40 per mil at the near-shelf edge Site U 1329. This isotope fractionation pattern is indicative of more extensive diagenetic alteration at sites with greater 13 C-enrichment. The magnitude of the 13 C-enrichment of CO 2 correlates with decreasing sedimentation rates and a diminishing occurrence of stratigraphic gas hydrate. We suggest the decreasing sedimentation rates increase the exposure time of sedimentary organic matter to aerobic and anaerobic degradation, during burial, thereby reducing the availability of metabolizable organic matter available for methane production. This process is reflected in the occurrence and distribution of gas hydrate within the northern Cascadia margin accretionary prism. Our observations are relevant for evaluating methane production and the occurrence of stratigraphic gas hydrate within other convergent margins...|$|E

40|$|Prior to 2006, the {{knowledge}} about cold seeps around New Zealand was based mainly on accidental recovery of seep fauna or methane-derived carbonates by fishermen and {{the detection of}} flares in fish-finding sonars. Lewis and Marshall (1996; NZJGG) compiled these findings, providing the first details on 13 seep sites. Four of those are located at the Hikurangi Margin along {{the east coast of}} New Zealand’s North Island. Since then, three international cruises in 2006 and 2007 enhanced our knowledge considerably about methane seepage along the Hikurangi Margin, an area which has widely distributed and in places very strong BSR. Two cruises on the RV TANGAROA (led by GNS Science and NIWA, NZ) in 2006 focused on extensive reconnaissance work (multibeam mapping, seismic surveys, flare imaging, visual observations) as well as fauna sampling, geochemical pore water analyses and CTD casts including water sampling for methane analyses. Several new seep sites were discovered during these cruises. Using these data, very detailed investigations in four main working areas could be performed during a 10 -week expedition with RV SONNE (SO 191, led by IFM-GEOMAR, Germany). All research topics currently discussed in the scientific community were addressed using state-of-the-art equipment (e. g. deep-tow side-scan, TV-guided sampling, lander and ROV-deployments). Fourteen institutes from seven countries were involved (Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland). Echosounder and sidescan surveys unmistakably revealed active seep sites by detecting bubbles in the water column and carbonate precipitation at the seafloor forming massive chemoherm complexes. These complexes are associated with typical seep fauna like tube worms, bivalve mollusk species (Calyptogena, Bathymodiolus),and bacterial mats. At the fringe of these chemoherms dark sediment patches were observed which exihibit a novel seep habitat dominated by dense beds of two new species of heterotrophic ampharetid polychaetes. Bubble release was visually observed at several sites and recorded in the backscatter of various acoustic devices. At one site (680 m water depth) very strong, pulsing outbursts could be observed repeatedly with methane fluxes of 20 to 25 l/min (60 to 74 mol/min). Intense CTD sampling and onboard methane analyses revealed that at least three of the areas are actively venting methane with an upper boundary at about 500 m, due to a density barrier. ADCP data indicate tide-dependent changes in current speed and direction. Delta 13 C values of dissolved <b>methane</b> <b>range</b> from - 71 to - 19 permil, reflecting bacterial oxidation of methane in the water column, with a removal rate of 38 nM/day (or 11 to 19 Extensive pore-water measurements, including in situ measurements during lander deployments, were aimed at evaluating flux rates of dissolved geochemical species and free gas. These measurements revealed that the dark sediment patches represent a remarkable seep habitat because of its very high methane fluxes and total oxygen consumption rates. Detailed seismic and controlled-source electromagnetic surveys allowed quantification of gas hydrates and regional estimates of fluid-flow focusing and the impact on the gas hydrate stability and BSR occurrence. Furthermore, the geophysical data imaged fluid pathways under seeps and indicated that more seep sites could be found at the seafloor. In 2006 and 2007, 23 new seep sites have been identified and visually observed, which resulted in a total of 31 seeps sites for the Hikurangi Margin.

The carbon isotopic composition of <b>methane</b> <b>ranged</b> from – 61 to – 80 ‰ and exhibited positive correlation with methane concentration and the carbon isotopic composition of total carbonate (∑CO 2). The apparent fractionation factor (αcCH 4 -CO 2) between methane and ∑CO 2 was in the range between 1. 07 and 1. 085, which were rather high compared to previously reported values in freshwater sediments. The results sug-gested that major parts of methane were produced via CO 2 -H 2 in the Lake Biwa sediments. Water temperature, sedimentation rate, and composition of organic materials deposited are different not only among lakes but also within a lake, especially when the lake is large. The litto-ral sediment is characterized by relatively high temperature and load of organic matters from ter-restrial origins, while the profundal sediment is constantly low in temperature and rich in organic matters derived from the primary production in-side a lake (Yoshioka et al., 1988; Murase and Sakamoto, 2000).

40|$|Abstract—This {{work was}} {{conducted}} to determine the production of methane from different organic waste substrates. Laboratory-scale reactors (5. 0 L) operated at 55 °C was used. Three different types of organic wastes were used: residential food waste, chicken manure, and secondary sludge from wastewater treatment plant. After 90 days of thermophilic digestion, {{it was found that}} the <b>methane</b> content <b>range</b> from 57 to 97. 05 %. The highest production of methane was obtained with municipal wastewater sludge while the lowest production was obtained with food waste. It was also found that methane production was affected by the ratio of waste to water (w/v). Wastes dilution ratio of 1 : 2 showed comparatively higher methane content than the wastes dilution ratio of 1 : 1.

40|$|Anaerobic {{biodegradation}} {{of gasoline}} hydrocarbons, especially BTEX, can generate {{high concentrations of}} methane in the subsurface. Introducing easily fermented ethanol into gasoline may exacerbate this methane production. The purpose {{of this research is}} to evaluate the use of stable carbon and hydrogen isotope measurements to differentiate methane (CH 4) produced by biodegradation of ethanol from that produced by BTEX biodegradation. The δ 13 C of BTEX compounds ranges between- 23 ‰ and- 30 ‰. Ethanol is produced mainly from C 4 plants, such as corn and sugar cane, which have a 13 C signature between- 10 ‰ and- 16 ‰ and these unique δ 13 C signatures should be reflected in degradation products including methane. The isotope data obtained on ethanol samples from commercial sources showed 13 C and 2 H values ranging from- 11. 1 ‰ to- 13. 0 ‰ and from- 171. 9 ‰ to- 227. 2 ‰, respectively. Anaerobic microcosm studies evaluated the carbon isotope composition of inorganic carbon (IC) and CH 4 and hydrogen isotope composition of CH 4 produced by the degradation of ethanol and toluene. However, no toluene degradation was observed in the microcosm experiment using ethanol and toluene and it is not reported in this paper. The initial δ 13 C value of the ethanol was- 11. 1 ‰. The δ 13 C value of methane changed from an initial value of- 31. 4 ‰ to a final value of- 18. 1 ‰. Very depleted δ 2 H values around- 400 ‰ were obtained for methane. Preliminary findings from a field site historically contaminated by hydrocarbons reveal a δ 13 C of <b>methane</b> <b>ranging</b> between- 57. 1 ‰ and- 65. 9 ‰ which are significantly more depleted than the isotopic values found in the laboratory experiments. The results of this study have shown than a combined use of carbon and hydrogen isotopes offer a new tool to fingerprint methane produced from ethanol degradation from that of other sources of methane such as BTEX or methane naturally produced in aquifers...|$|R
40|$|The Lena River {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} Russian rivers {{draining}} into the Laptev Sea. Due to predicted increasing temperatures, the permafrost areas surrounding the Lena Delta will melt at increasing rates. With this melting, high amounts of methane will reach the waters of the Lena and the adjacent Laptev Sea. Methane oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria is the only biological way to reduce methane concentrations within the system. However, the polar estuary of the Lena River is a challenging environment for bacteria, with strong fluctuations in salinity and temperature. We determined the activity (tracer method) and the abundance (qPCR) of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria. We described the methanotrophic population with MISA; as well as the methane distribution (head space) and other abiotic parameters in the Lena Delta in September 2013. In 'riverine water' (S 20) a median 28 nM was observed. The Lena River was not the methane source for surface water, and bottom water methane concentrations were mainly influenced by the concentration in surface sediments. However, the methane oxidation rate in riverine and polar water was very similar (0. 419 and 0. 400 nM/d), but with a higher relative abundance of methanotrophs and a higher 'estimated diversity' with respect to MISA OTUs in the 'rivine water' as compared to 'polar water'. The turnover times of <b>methane</b> <b>ranged</b> from 167 d in 'mixed water', 91 d in 'riverine water' and only 36 d in 'polarwater'. Also the environmental parameters influencing the methane oxidation rate and the methanotrophic population differed between the water masses. Thus we postulate a riverine methanotrophic population limited by sub-optimal temperatures and substrate concentrations and a polar methanotrophic population being well adapted to the cold and methane poor environment, but limited by the nitrogen content. The diffusive methane flux into the atmosphere ranged from 4 - 163 µmol m 2 d- 1 (median 24). For the total methane inventory of the investigated area, the diffusive methane flux was responsible for 8 % loss, compared to only 1 % of the methane consumed by the methanotrophic bacteria within the system...|$|R
40|$|The remote {{detection}} of {{the concentration of}} methane at room temperature is performed by a sensor that is configured by the combination of radio frequency identification (RFID), and functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The proposed sensor is schemed as a thin film RFID tag in a polyethylene substrate, on which a metal trace dipole, a metal trace T impedance matching networks, a 0. 5 µm-CMOS RF/DC rectifier chipset and a sensor head of palladium-decorated single walled carbon nanotubes (Pd-SWCNTs) are surface mounted in cascade. The performances of the sensor are examined and described by the defined parameters of the received signal strength index (RSSI) and the comparative analog identifier (∆AID). Results validate the sensor’s ability to detect molecules of methane at room temperature, showing that the RSSI can increase 4 dB and the ∆AID can increase 3 % in response to <b>methane</b> concentrations <b>ranging</b> from zero to 100 ppm...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{behaviour}} {{of methane}} molecules inside carbon nanotube {{at room temperature}} is studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations. A methane molecule is represented either by a shapeless super-atom or by rigid set of 5 interaction centres localised on atoms. Different loadings of <b>methane</b> molecules <b>ranging</b> from the dense gas density to the liquid density, {{and the influence of}} flexibility of the CNT on structural and dynamics properties of confined molecules are considered. The simulation results show the decreases of the diffusion coefficient of methane molecules with density. At higher densities diffusion coefficient values are almost independent of molecular shape, but at low densities one observes faster motion of the super-atom molecule than that for the tetrahedral model of the molecule. The nanotube flexibility does not have effect on diffusivity of methane molecules, {{and its impact on the}} molecular structure is weak. It is found that methane molecules in the vicinity of the nanotube wall show tripod orientation with respect to the nanotube surface...|$|R

Success of restoration as well as greenhouse gas exchange of these bogs is influenced by environmental stress factors as drought and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We determined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of sites in the strongly decomposed center and less decomposed edge of the Pietzmoor bog in NW Germany in 2004. Also, we examined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of mesocosms from the center and edge before, during, and following a drainage experiment as well as carbon dioxide release from disturbed unfertilized and nitrogen fertilized surface peat. In the field, <b>methane</b> fluxes <b>ranged</b> from 0 to 3. 8 mg m − 2 h − 1 and were highest from hollows.

40|$|Single stage {{digestion}} {{tests were}} performed on food waste (FW) alone and mixed with olive husks (OH), to assess the influence of composition and pH on hydrogen and methane production. Process intensification with thermal pretreatment to further enhance the biological conversion of substrate constituents was investigated, too. Best performance in terms of H 2 production (up to 87 NL/kg VSfed) was observed at initial pH 7 with the co- digestion of pretreated mix, {{because of the high}} amount of solubilized carbohydrates transformed rapidly during the first hours. Pretreatment of the sole FW enhanced hydrogen production only at initial pH 7, while successive <b>methane</b> production, <b>ranging</b> from 339 to 446 NL/kg VSfed, was not significantly affected. The strategy of co-digestion with untreated OH resulted encouraging to achieve contemporarily high methane and hydrogen conversion rates. The First Order/Modified Gompertz equation, the Logistic function and the Transference Function were used for experimental data fitting; the Modified Gompertz equation proved to be the best fit for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Climate change impacts are {{increasingly}} becoming more evident e. g. through heavy rainfall episodes and subsequent flooding. Methane {{is a significant}} greenhouse gas that {{has been linked to}} these impacts and {{the oil and gas industry}} is a major source of anthropogenic methane emission. Recent studies have suggested that the tropical region hold some unexpectedly high methane concentration and that the recent changes in the global methane burden are poorly understood. To address this research gap, we present a first effort to quantify methane emissions from one of the most vulnerable oil and gas infrastructures in Nigeria (a tropical country). A combination of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier- 1 approach and an adapted Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model was used to estimate methane emissions from the system 2 C transport pipeline. We then tested the hypothesis of no significant change in methane emissions trend from the pipeline using the between group t-test inferential analysis. Key findings include: (a) a crude oil throughput of 55, 143 to 1, 500, 500 barrels (8767 to 238, 561 m 3) emitted <b>methane</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 04734 to 1. 288 MT (± 50 to 200 %) respectively, and (b) surprisingly, methane emissions along the system 2 C pipeline seem to have continued without significant change between 2005, and 2008 to 2012 despite the low crude oil throughput in 2009. This indicates the likelihood of continuous but rising methane emissions from the pipeline network over a six-year period; and only further research can ascertain if similar trend can be observed elsewhere in the tropical region. These findings are unique and contribute to the current global debate on methane emissions from the largely unmonitored tropical region. Therefore, we recommend that stakeholders should set up a study plan for the identification and continuous monitoring of methane emissions from the key oil and gas infrastructure and explore opportunities for geoengineering applications as part of climate change mitigation. Coordinated engagement in international schemes such as the Natural Gas STAR program, Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Methane Initiative amongst others would promote strategic and measurable methane reduction plans in Nigeria and other countries within/outside the tropical region...|$|R
