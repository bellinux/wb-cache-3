The percentage of students achieving five or <b>more</b> <b>good</b> GCSEs, at grades A*–C including maths and English, rose to 52.5 per cent, from 50.8 per cent in 2007. This is above the national average of 47.6 per cent.|$|E

5|$|Still an {{automatic}} choice under new national manager Javier Clemente, Žigić scored the only goal in Serbia's first competitive match {{as a separate}} country, a Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Azerbaijan in September 2006. He scored once, missed two <b>more</b> <b>good</b> chances and was then sent off for elbowing an opponent in stoppage time of the March 2007 qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan, so missed the next, a home draw with Portugal, and also missed the Finland fixture in June after surgery on a facial injury. He still scored seven goals as Serbia failed to qualify.|$|E

5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did <b>more</b> <b>good</b> than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform <b>more</b> <b>good</b> than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

25|$|Born in Sydney, Australia, Ferris {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Alfred Shaw's touring English team {{on his home}} ground in 1886/87. He took seven wickets in the match, including five in the second innings, and after several <b>more</b> <b>good</b> displays was selected for the first Test, also at Sydney. The England first innings was a disaster as they collapsed to what remains their lowest Test total of 45 all out, Ferris bowling unchanged with Charlie Turner, but despite his nine wickets in the game England, inspired by Billy Barnes' second-innings 6–28, scraped to a 13-run win.|$|E

Because England consumes within itself <b>more</b> <b>goods</b> of foreign growth, imported from the several countries where they are produced or wrought, than any other nation in the world. And--3. Because for the doing this England employs more shipping and more seamen than any other nation, and, some think, than all the other nations, of Europe.|$|R
