40|$|By {{analyzing}} the human antibody repertoire {{in terms of}} structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven VH and seven VL (four Vk and three Vl) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversi®cation, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites ¯anking the CDRs. Molecular modeling veri®ed that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all <b>master</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A ®rst set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2 109 members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} lineage choices are decided by genetic {{networks}} that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry {{in terms of}} how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU. 1 and GATA- 1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these <b>master</b> <b>genes,</b> such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the <b>master</b> <b>genes</b> to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU. 1 and GATA- 1. The PU. 1 -GATA- 1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBP alpha-FOG- 1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream <b>master</b> <b>genes</b> and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, {{is an example of a}} network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} sources of genetic diversity, ranging from {{programmed}} mutagenesis in antibody genes to random mutagenesis during species evolution or development of cancer. We propose that mutations in DNA sequence-specific transcription factors that target response elements (REs) in many genes {{can also provide}} for rapid and broad phenotypic diversity, if the mutations lead to altered binding affinities at individual REs. To test this concept, we examined the in vivo transactivation capacity of wild-type human and murine p 53 and 25 partial function mutants. The p 53 s were expressed in yeast from a rheostatable promoter, and the transactivation capacities toward > 15 promoter REs upstream of a reporter gene were measured. Surprisingly, there was wide variation in transactivation by the mutant p 53 s toward the various REs. This is the first study to address directly the impact of mutations in a sequence-specific transcription factor on transactivation from {{a wide array of}} REs. We propose a <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> hypothesis for phenotypic diversity where the <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> is a single transcriptional activator (or repressor) that regulates many genes through different REs. Mutations of the <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> can lead to a variety of simultaneous changes in both the selection of targets and the extent of transcriptional modulation at the individual targets, resulting in a vast number of potential phenotypes that can be created with minimal mutational changes without altering existing protein–protein interactions...|$|E

Where the conversion between cell types occurs in the developing embryo, the process is referred to as transdetermination. Herein we examine some well-defined examples of transdetermination. Defining the molecular and cellular basis of transdetermination will help us to understand the normal developmental biology of the cells that interconvert, as well as identifying key regulatory transcription factors (<b>master</b> switch <b>genes)</b> that may be important for the reprogramming of stem cells.

40|$|ID {{elements}} are short interspersed elements (SINEs) found in high copy number in many rodent genomes. BC 1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, {{is derived from}} the single copy BC 1 RNA gene. The BC 1 RNA gene {{has been shown to be}} a <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID {{elements are}} dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC 1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3 '-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC 1 RNA gene as a <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> for amplification of ID elements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We study root {{cells from}} the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the {{communication}} channel conformed by the ethylene signal transduction pathway. A basic equation taken from our previous work relates the probability of expression of the gene ERF 1 to the concentration of ethylene. Results The above equation is used to compute the Shannon entropy (H) or degree of uncertainty that the genetic machinery has during the decoding of the message encoded by the ethylene specific receptors embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and transmitted into the nucleus by the ethylene signaling pathway. We show {{that the amount of}} information associated with the expression of the <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> ERF 1 (Ethylene Response Factor 1) can be computed. Then we examine the system response to sinusoidal input signals with varying frequencies to determine if the cell can distinguish between different regimes of information flow from the environment. Our results demonstrate that the amount of information managed by the root cell can be correlated with the frequency of the input signal. Conclusion The ethylene signaling pathway cuts off very low and very high frequencies, allowing a window of frequency response in which the nucleus reads the incoming message as a sinusoidal input. Out of this window the nucleus reads the input message as an approximately non-varying one. From this frequency response analysis we estimate: a) the gain of the system during the synthesis of the protein ERF 1 (~- 5. 6 dB); b) the rate of information transfer (0. 003 bits) during the transport of each new ERF 1 molecule into the nucleus and c) the time of synthesis of each new ERF 1 molecule (~ 21. 3 s). Finally, we demonstrate {{that in the case of}} the system of a single <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> (ERF 1) and a single slave gene (HLS 1), the total Shannon entropy is completely determined by the uncertainty associated with the expression of the <b>master</b> <b>gene.</b> A second proposition shows that the Shannon entropy associated with the expression of the HLS 1 gene determines the information content of the system that is related to the interaction of the antagonistic genes ARF 1, 2 and HLS 1. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of a set of}} genomic human Alu elements is based on a published alignment and a recent classification of these sequences. After separation of the Alu sequences into families, the consensus sequences of these families are determined, using the correct weighting of the unidirectional decay of CG-dinucleotides. For, the tenfold greater mutation rate at CG's requires separate consideration of an independent clock at every stage of analysis. The distributions of the substitutions with respect to the new consensus sequences, taking the CG and the non-CG-nucleotide positions separately, lie far closer to the expected distributions than the total diversity. Computer analysis of the folding of RNAs derived from these sequences indicates that RNA secondary structure is conserved among Alu families, suggesting its importance for Alu proliferation and/or function. The folding pattern, further substantiated by a number of compensatory mutations, includes secondary structure domains which are homologous to those observed in 7 SL RNA and a defined region of interaction between the two Alu subunits. These results are consistent with a model in which a small number of conserved Alu <b>master</b> <b>genes</b> give rise via retroposition to the numerous copies of Alu pseudogenes, that then diversify by random substitution. The <b>master</b> <b>genes</b> appeared at different periods during evolution giving rise to different families of Alu sequences...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe complex {{spatial and}} paracrine {{relationships}} between the various liver histotypes are essential for proper functioning of the hepatic parenchymal cells. Only within a correct tissue organization, in fact, they stably maintain their identity and differentiated phenotype. The loss of histotype identity, which invariably occurs in the primary hepatocytes in culture, or in vivo in particular pathological conditions (fibrosis and tumours), is {{mainly because of the}} phenomenon of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT process, that occurs in the many epithelial cells, appears to be driven by a number of general, non-tissue-specific, master transcriptional regulators. The reverse process, the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), as yet much less characterized at a molecular level, restores specific epithelial identities, and thus must include tissue-specific master elements. In this review, we will summarize the so far unveiled events of EMT/MET occurring in liver cells. In particular, we will focus on hepatocyte and describe the pivotal role in the control of EMT/MET dynamics exerted by a tissue-specific molecular mini-circuitry. Recent evidence, indeed, highlighted as two transcriptional factors, the <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> of EMT Snail, and the <b>master</b> <b>gene</b> of hepatocyte differentiation HNF 4 α, exhorting a direct reciprocal repression, act as pivotal elements in determining opposite cellular outcomes.
