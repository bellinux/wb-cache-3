5000|$|On 23 April 1984, Kittiwake {{collided}} with the attack submarine [...] at Norfolk, Virginia, while Bergall was moored to the pier astern of her. Kittiwake was getting underway {{for the first time}} since she had undergone maintenance, during which her <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> was re-wired improperly, causing it and the screw it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on Kittiwakes bridge. This was unknown to Kittiwakes bridge personnel, who found that Kittiwake started to move astern when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the motor drive speed in order to correct it and get Kittiwake moving forward, but unwittingly caused Kittiwake to move further astern and at a higher speed. Still not realizing that Kittiwakes <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> was operating in reverse of what they expected, Kittiwakes bridge personnel then ordered another increase in Kittiwakes forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern. This continued until Kittiwakes stern backed into Bergalls sonar dome.|$|E
40|$|The {{spinning}} rocket simulator (SRS) is {{an ongoing}} project at Oral Roberts University. The goal of the SRS is to gather crucial data concerning a spinning rocket under thrust {{for the purpose of}} analysis and correction of the coning motion experienced by this type of spacecraft maneuver. The computer animation simulates a virtual, scale model of the component of the SRS that represents the spacecraft itself. This component is known as the (VSM), or virtual spacecraft model. During actual physical simulation, this component of the SRS will experience a coning. The goal of the animation is to cone the VSM within that range to accurately represent the motion of the actual simulator. The drive system of the SRS is the apparatus that turns the actual simulator. It consists of a drive motor, motor mount and chain to power the simulator into motion. The motor mount is adjustable and rigid for high torque application. A digital stepper motor controller actuates the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> for linear acceleration. The chain transfers power from the motor to the simulator via sprockets on both ends...|$|E

Country has achieved such success thanks to its geographic, strategic, and demographic advantages. The work will examine the effectiveness of advantageus economic sectors of the country to respond how much effective these streghts are for the country in today's global economy during which the work will focus its attention to the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> of the economy, the Vietnamese human resources. The shortcomings of the Vietnamese labour force and the need for reforms in education and training systems to achieve greater economic efficency will be analyzed afterwards. In conclusion, it should noted that foreign direct investment flows to all major sectors of the economy and {{play a key role in}} the development of technological level of the country. Vietnamese workforce lacks technical expertise in the health service, counstruction industry, transport and logistics and the chemical industry. Therefore it is neccessary that the local firms and educational institutions work closely together and define curricula and training programs for employees to achieve a better quality of Vietnamese workforce...|$|E

30|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} are the basement for fault diagnosis of different mechanical systems {{by means of}} vibration signals. The vibration performance has been analysed for the strength estimation or life prediction of TBM [1 – 3]. A multi-directional coupling dynamic model was established to analyse the {{dynamic characteristics}} of the cutterhead system in TBM. Different working parameters were studied {{to find out the}} optimization scheme for the cutterhead structure [1]. Zhang et al. [4] presented a dynamic model for the TBM revolving system considering the periodically varying mesh stiffness of the multiple pinions and the speed-torque characteristics of the variable frequency motor. The result showed the excavation torque could run up to a critical value in the extremely adverse excavation environments, which might result in an unexpected breakdown of TBM and even a failure of the drive motor. A multi-freedom coupling dynamic model for the cutterhead system was established to investigate its natural frequencies and vibration modes [5]. The model laid the foundation for the dynamic performance optimization and fatigue life prediction for the cutterhead system. Zou et al. [6] proposed a dynamic model for the main machine of TBM that included the cutterhead, the driving system, the thrust system, and the interaction between the TBM and the surrounding rocks in terms of the lump parameter method. Different researches show that vibration of TBM could influence the efficiency and the fatigue life of different components, especially the cutterhead and the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor.</b> However, the gripper cylinder is also vulnerable to the vibration which might be neglected. In this paper, the dynamic model of the gripper cylinder is established to analyse its vibration performance with degeneration of health condition.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{material}} {{could be}} developed into new material that would be useful for many interests. Fiber as composite raw material must be given pretreatment {{to improve the quality}} of composite. In this research, raw material for the composite was umbrella grass (Cyperus Alternifolius). A tool was designed to facilitate the processes of rolling or pressing, or abbreviated as roll press. Indeed, the design of roll press was preceded by designing the construction section that involved shaft, transmission system, bearing, pulley belt, and driver motor to move the roll. Result of rolling must be suitable for processing umbrella grass into the fiber of composite raw material. Testing was conduced to examine the work of the tool against the stalk of umbrella grass. Two testing was considered. First was testing against the variation of loads, which involved 10 kg, 12 kg and 14 kg. Second test was against the variation of roll rotation at 160 rpm, 197 rpm and 280 rpm. Result of both tests provided specific fiber derived from umbrella grass that would be compatible to be composite material. Some results of research were indicated. <b>Main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> was ½ PK with rotation (n 1) = 1430 rpm. Pulley diameter (d 1) was 75 mm. Reducer system was signified by n 2 = 831 rpm and d 2 = 129 mm, and if d 3 = 59 mm was used, the outcome was n 4 = 160 rpm with d 4 = 307 mm. In case of bearing, its sliding moment was 0. 309 N. mm and tangent force was 2. 06 N. The frame of roll press tool was designed at the dimension of length x wide x height = 600 mm x 320 mm x 1200 mm. The best parameter was 160 rpm with load force of 10 kg. By taking account all these results, it could be said that the result of roll press processing had successfully produced the fiber from umbrella grass into the suitable raw material for the composite...|$|E
40|$|Variable speed {{oil free}} screw {{compressors}} {{can be used}} in upstream oil and gas applications such as gas collection and flare gas recovery. The critical nature of these applications is such that the owners closely monitor the drive train of the package as long un-planned stoppages are extremely expensive. If any of the monitored parameters start to deviate from the norm then shut-downs and services can be scheduled in a timely manner preventing costly stoppages. This paper first describes the parameters monitored on the drive train as required by the international standards used by the oil and gas companies. The paper then leads onto an in-depth description of the instrumentation mounted on and even within the drive train, incorporating the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor,</b> gearbox and compressor, and how the instrumentation is monitored by a package machine condition monitoring system that interfaces with the package control system. As the final location of the instruments is often in extremely hazardous environments such as highly corrosive offshore marine environments or abrasive hot desert environments, and the compressors themselves are often compressing highly combustible gas such as methane or even hydrogen, the protection methods employed by the instruments to prevent explosion is then discussed. The multiple communications networks that allow the condition monitoring system to send its values to the package control system and the client’s distributed control system are also discussed. This discussion includes how the measured values make their way from the stand alone machine condition monitoring system to the compressor control system and how the two systems integrate with each other to protect the package before annunciating the system status to the client 2 ̆ 7 s distributed control system. Finally a full description is given on how these measured values impact on the running of the package with respect to the compressors service life and the control systems ability to maintain the process setpoints. A solution to the presented problem is then offered...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high stock removal rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher stock removal rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher stock removal rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed centreless grinding of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high stock removal rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200. The results enable a data based control strategy to be formulated and it is proposed that in process variable kinematics will allow a single cycle roughing and finishing operation on a suitably adapted {{centreless grinding machine}}...|$|E

The {{force of the}} drive shaft is analyzed, and the vibration form of the drive shaft is confirmed. Using the lumped parameter method to simplify the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, the lumped mass model and the force model were been obtained. When bending vibrating, the natural frequency of the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> shaft is calculated using the transfer matrix method. The calculated critical speed is 43755 r/min, which far outweighs the motor rated speed. It means that the drive shaft under normal work won't be resonance, which accords with the request of production.
