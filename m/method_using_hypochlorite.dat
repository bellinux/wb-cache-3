40|$|In a first step, the {{surfaces}} of polyethylene films have been modified by grafting urethane monoacrylate monomer under UV irradiation in ambient air. For native films, this grafting was successfully realized but the grafted surface was heterogeneous. To overcome this drawback and obtain a smooth and homogeneous coating, a wet oxidation <b>method</b> <b>using</b> sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> through two different processes was developed. The oxidation mechanism of the PE films has been established. As {{a consequence of the}} oxidation, the wettability of the grafted films was strongly increased as measured by sessile drop technique and Wilhelmy plate method. The hydrophilicity is due to carbonyl and carboxylic groups created on the treated surface. Grafting of several formulations containing different amounts of monomer, carrier and photosensitizer was successfully evidenced by analyzing the residues obtained from PE extraction in hot toluene. Indeed, FTIR, XPS, DSC and elementary analysis showed that the polyacrylate was effectively grafted on PE pre-oxidized films. Moreover, the obtained grafted surfaces corresponding to important oxidation time were homogeneous as shown by SEM and AFM. In a second step, acrylate grafting was used to induce specific properties onto the surface. This study was focused on antibacterial effect. The process starts by a dissolution of poly(4 -vinylbenzyl chloride) (PVBC) in the urethane monoacrylate monomer followed by photopolymerisation of the latter. Anchoring of different PVBC based formulations was confirmed by FTIR analysis, performed onto obtained residues after extraction in hot toluene and dichloromethane. In a last step, the grafted coatings were quaternized by using triethylamine in N, N-dimethyl formamide by a nucleophilic displacement reaction. Antibacterial effect of the quaternized samples was measured by Kirby Bauer method. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

40|$|Biotherapeutic drugs, {{derived from}} {{biological}} molecules such as proteins and DNA, are becoming an integral and exceptionally critical aspect of modern medicine. Compared to common pharmaceutical drugs, biotherapeutics are much larger {{in size and}} have greater target specificity, allowing them to treat many chronic diseases ranging from cancer to rheumatoid arthritis. The major issue with protein based therapeutics is that they readily undergo proteolysis, or enzymatic degradation, when administered through subcutaneous injections. Traditionally, biotherapeutic modification procedures have centered {{on the use of}} PEG derivatives. This process, called PEGylation, is unfavorable due to the increases in molecular weights of the proteins and the heterogeneous mixture of products formed. Instead of PEG derivatives, we propose peptoids with N- methoxyethylglycine (NMEG) side chains to decrease proteolysis. NMEG groups are more advantageous than PEG derivatives due to their low molecular weight and ability to form homogeneous products. Our work focuses on increasing the protease resistance of target biotherapeutic proteins by cross-linking a NMEG- 5 peptoid to a cytochrome c via reductive amination. In the presence of a reducing agent, an imine bond is formed through the reduction of the peptoid’s aldehyde group and cytochrome c’s primary amine groups. Due to the expensive and unstable nature of commercially available aldehyde side chains, a green chemistry <b>method,</b> <b>using</b> only sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> (bleach) and 2, 6, 6 -Tetramethylpiperidinoxy (TEMPO, free radical), oxidized the peptoid’s hydroxyl group into the desired aldehyde for cross linkage...|$|R

Although {{it has been shown that}} chlorinated derivatives of PAHs (Cl-PAHs) may be formed during the water chlorination procedure, little is known about their potential genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. The objectives of the present work were to prepare and characterize the major chlorinated derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and fluoranthene (Fluo), to develop an analytical methodology for their quantification in water samples and to analyse their potential genotoxicity. Chlorinated standards were prepared by a newly developed two phase <b>method</b> (water/n-hexane) <b>using</b> sodium <b>hypochlorite.</b> 6 -Chloro-benzo[a]pyrene was selectively obtained from BaP, while 1, 3 - dichloro-fluoranthene and 3 -chloro-fluoranthene were obtained from Fluo. All products were isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The formation of BaP- and Fluo-chlorinated derivatives under aqueous chlorination conditions was observed using a SPE-HPLC-FLD methodology. In addition, the cytotoxic and genotoxic activities of the three chlorinated derivatives were analyzed in comparison to their parent compounds, in a human-derived hepatoma cell line using the neutral red uptake and comet assays, respectively. The results showed that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 μM, 6 -Cl-BaP was able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP, suggesting a more potent genotoxic effect. In contrast, neither Fluo nor its chlorinated derivatives were genotoxic in the same cell line.

40|$|In {{the food}} industry, <b>hypochlorite</b> is <b>used</b> {{to reduce the}} {{microbiological}} load of foodstuffs. Its use may result {{in the formation of}} toxic disinfection byproducts. However it is currently generally accepted that below particular intensities its use does not represent a safety concern even in direct contact with foods. In addition however, the <b>use</b> of <b>hypochlorite</b> in contact with foods should also be considered in the framework of consumer acceptance. The formation of 3 -chlorotyrosine seems a potential analytical target to assess the <b>use</b> of <b>hypochlorite</b> in foods. Firstly, the potency of 3 -chlorotyrosine was evaluated as an indicator for the <b>use</b> of <b>hypochlorite</b> in contact with foods in comparison with the other molecular changes in proteins using casein and whey proteins as a model at various oxidant/protein ratios and at different pHs. Secondly, 3 -chlorotyrosine formation was evaluated in four fish species (whiting, European plaice, gilthead seabream and Atlantic salmon) as a result of hypochlorite dipping. The last set of experiments studied the formation and occurrence of 3 -chlorotyrosine in ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables on the Belgian market. In addition, the dietary exposure via RTE vegetable consumption for Belgian and Spanish populations, exemplifying Northern European lower RTE vegetable consumption and Mediterranean higher consumption patterns, was estimated.

40|$|Microplastics (plastics < 5 mm) are {{emerging}} pollutants of growing concern. Since the 2000 s their abundance, degradation and impacts on wildlife {{are more and}} more studied and understood. However, few data are available particularly in freshwater ecosystems. Some fish species have plastic in their stomach contents such as: Gobio gobio, Alburnus alburnus, Leuciscus leuciscus while other species have not. In controlled conditions, microplastics were found to cause negative impacts in fish: leaching of micropollutants, endocrine disruption, hatching inhibition and decrease of growth rate of larvae. The first step in the understanding of these impacts is the quantification and the characterisation of ingested plastics by organisms in the field. Plastics and other anthropogenic particles (textile fibres) were isolated from 40 stomachs of Squalius cephalus (the European chub) collected in the Seine River (Paris) in August 2016. One station is upstream and the three others are downstream of the Paris Megacity conurbation. This megacity exerts a great pressure on the Seine River. Plastics were isolated thanks to a <b>method</b> <b>using</b> sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> and all particles were then analysed by Raman spectroscopy. The method consists in a degradation overnight of the organic matter in the stomach contents by sodium hypochlorite. This mixture is then filtrated and particles longer than 5 µm are resuspended into an ethanol (99 %) solution for centrifugation. The precipitate, containing all particles denser than ethanol, is collected (1. 3 ml) and spread on a mount for Raman spectroscopy. Several lasers were used, depending on the particle’s colour. Spectra were recorded with an accumulation ranging from 5 to 50 s. Preliminary results showed that 7 individuals out of 25 already analysed (28 %) had ingested at least one anthropogenic particle (AP). Eight APs were found and characterized, the majority of them (7) being dyed fibres. One of these fibres was made of a plastic polymer, the polyethylene terephthalate. The others were made of an undetermined material as Raman analyses gave only information on the dye. The eighth particle was a fragment of polypropylene. It {{is the first time that}} fish are studied as a part of plastic pollution in the Seine River. All isolated particles have been analysed leading to precise results. The percentage of occurrence is in the common range of other studies while much lower than the European flounder coming from the River Thames and higher than fish coming from Geneva Lake. It is not surprising that the majority of APs were fibres as another study in the river Seine found that the fibres concentration in water is far greater than the fragments concentration, as well as in urban runoff. It is also possible that the retention time of fibres in the gut is longer than fragments. Toxicological impacts of fibre ingestion is still unknown despite their ubiquity in many freshwater environments. Peer reviewe...|$|R
