5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that he had heard rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> in the past, but arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up {{in his living room}} and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, Đurišić was very {{critical}} of Mihailović's leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops {{to move to the}} area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia. At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
