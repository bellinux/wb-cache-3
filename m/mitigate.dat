40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the fish {{communities}} in <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove areas in the Port Everglades estuary. This study of fish recolonization of recently (ca. 5 years) planted mangrove forests, tested the null hypothesis that the species composition, size distribution and abundance of fish collected in natural, established and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments were the same. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in John U. Lloyd Park. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in West Lake Park. A variety of sampling gear types were utilized in the collection of fishes. Sampling was only done at low tide for all areas. Differences (chi square) in the abundances of fishes occurred between the natural mangrove sites in John U. Lloyd and West Lake Parks. These differences are thought to be due largely to differences in the hydrodynamic environment (i. e. tidal flushing, discharge rates of waterflow) and seasonality (i. e. month). However, differences between the fish communities in the <b>mitigated</b> areas of both parks were not significant at the 0. 05 level of probability. Small fishes, the forage base for the larger piscivores, were equally represented in the <b>mitigated</b> sites throughout the study, and always dominated their respective communities numerically. Differences between natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas occurred in the distributions of transient species. In general, these transient fishes occurred only in the natural sites: the larval stage of one transient species, however, was found only in the <b>mitigated</b> sites. Likewise, within a species, smaller fishes were generally found in the <b>mitigated</b> sites and larger fishes were found in the natural sites. Thus, differences in the distributions of fishes between the <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove sites may be due to food availability as well as structural differences (i. e. spacing of plants) in each habitat. This study shows that <b>mitigated</b> mangrove forests are suitable habitats for small, forage species and presently there are differences in the fish populations in the natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments, the largest mangrove ecosystem remaining in Broward County...|$|R

50|$|One {{review of}} the CJP data showed that jurors who were asked a {{hypothetical}} question regarding how much certain <b>mitigating</b> factors would influence their sentencing decisions were true, 56.2 percent of the jurors would consider a lesser sentence than death if a history of mental illness was presented as a <b>mitigating</b> factor and 73.6 percent would do so if evidence of mental retardation were presented.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} all {{relevant}} <b>mitigating</b> factors {{must be considered}} in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It is not sufficient to allow the defendant to present <b>mitigating</b> factors during the trial if those factors are not considered in the sentencing. If the jury is not instructed to consider all relevant <b>mitigating</b> factors, the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights are violated as failure to do so constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that Tennard's IQ was a relevant <b>mitigating</b> factor, and that the sentencing jury should have been made to consider it for the purposes of mitigation.|$|R
50|$|Thus {{the court}} struck down jury {{instructions}} in {{death penalty cases}} that do not ask about <b>mitigating</b> factors including {{a consideration of the}} defendant's social, medical, and psychological history, saying that the jury must be instructed to consider <b>mitigating</b> factors even when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that an expanded explanation including these factors be given in the jury instructions to insure the jury weighs all the <b>mitigating</b> factors.|$|R

40|$|Why should {{differences}} between regulatory and accounting policies be <b>mitigated?</b> Because <b>mitigating</b> such differences could facilitate convergence – {{as well as}} financial stability. The paper “Fair Value Accounting and Procyclicality: <b>Mitigating</b> Regulatory and Accounting Policy Differences through Regulatory Structure Reforms and Enforced Self Regulation” illustrates how the implementation of accounting standards and policies, in certain instances, have contrasted with Basel Committee initiatives aimed at <b>mitigating</b> procyclicality and facilitating forward looking provisioning. The paper also highlights how and why {{differences between}} regulatory and accounting policies could (and should) be <b>mitigated.</b> This paper focuses on how recent regulatory reforms – with particular reference to the Dodd Frank Act, impact fair value measurements.
