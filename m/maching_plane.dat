40|$|The {{relation}} of Whitcomb's "area rule" to the linear formulas for wave drag at lightly supersonic speeds is discussed. By adopting an approximate {{relation between the}} source strength and the geometry of a wing-body combination, the wave-drag theory is expressed in terms involving the areas intercepted by oblique <b>planes</b> or <b>Mach</b> <b>planes.</b> The resulting formulas are checked by comparison with the drag measurements obtained in wind-tunnel experiments and in experiments with falling models in free air. Finally, a theory for determining wing-body shapes of minimum drag at supersonic Mach numbers is discussed and some preliminary experiments are reported...|$|R

40|$|As an {{extension}} of the transonic area rule, a concept for interrelating the wave drags of wing-body combinations at moderate supersonic speeds with axial developments of cross-sectional area has been derived. The wave drag of a combination at a given supersonic speed is related to a number of developments of cross-sectional areas as intersected by <b>Mach</b> <b>planes.</b> On the basis of this concept and other design procedures, a structurally feasible, swept-wing [...] indented-body combination has been designed to have relatively high maximum lift-drag ratios over a range of transonic and moderate supersonic Mach numbers. The wing of the combination has been designed to have reduced drag associated with lift and, when used with an indented body, to have low zero-lift wave drag. Experimental results have been obtained for this configuration at Mach numbers from 0. 80 to 2. 01. Maximum lift-drag ratios of approximately 14 and 9 were measured at Mach numbers of 1. 15 and 1. 41, respectively. Includes bibliographical references (p. 12).

50|$|The SR-72 is the {{proposed}} {{successor to the}} SR-71 Blackbird. There were unconfirmed rumors about the SR-72 dating back to 2007, when various sources disclosed that Lockheed Martin was developing a <b>Mach</b> 6 <b>plane</b> for the US Air Force. Such a development was confirmed on 1 November 2013, when the Skunk Works revelations were published about the development work on the SR-72 exclusively in Aviation Week & Space Technology.

40|$|H. J. Stewart's (1) {{analysis}} using the linearized equation of supersonic flows for finding the lift {{of a flat}} delta wing at supersonic speeds when the leading edges of the wing lie within the Mach cone of the vertex, is extended to the case when the loading edges of the wing lie outside the Mach cone of the vertex. From the condition specified on the wing, Fourier expansions are found for the downward vertical induced velocity component w, outside and on the Mach cone of the vertex. The constant velocities on the wing, outside the Mach cone of the vertex, are deduced from the shock-wave relations across the <b>Mach</b> <b>planes</b> of the leading udges. Fourier expansions are found for the axial and transverse disturbance velocities u, v. the constancy of these velocities, in regions outside the Mach cone, being deduced from the vorticity relations. The methods of the complex variable, used by Stewart, are used to obtain the induced velocity components inside the Mach cone of the vertex. The solution for the velocity component w is found from the conditions to be satisfied on the wing and on the Mach cone of the vertex. Hence, by using the vorticity relations and the Cauchy-Riemann relations, the solutions for the velocities u, v are found. The pressure distribution on the wing is deduced, and the total lift calculated, by integrating the pressure difference {{over the surface of}} the wing. The lift coefficient, based on area, is found to be independent of the angle of the wing. The corresponding drag coefficient is also found. 1...|$|R

50|$|After takeoff {{the plane}} reaches an {{altitude}} of 12 km. This classical aeronautical phase can last for 45 minutes. The pilot shuts down the jets and starts the methane oxygen rocket engine {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. The plane then raises along a vertical trajectory.

40|$|The {{production}} of self-sustained tones (up to 125 dB) by a low <b>Mach</b> number free <b>plane</b> jet impinging on a slotted plate, known as slot-tone, is experimentally studied. For all geometries of the slot’s edge tested, the tones are generated from 6 m/s {{and when a}} resonant mode of the duct from which the jet flows out is excited. The Strouhal number associated with the tones fundamental frequency describes stages. These one {{are linked to the}} number of vortices present, with vortex pairing possibilities. On the other hand, the frequency domain of the fundamental is defined by the two instability modes of the jet. If the edge of the slot is beveled and if this one is placed backwards to the flow, the tones occurs at a lower speed (3. 5 m/s) as soon as the jet becomes turbulent, and the excitation of an acoustic resonator is then not necessary...|$|R
40|$|The density {{variance}} - Mach number {{relation of}} the turbulent interstellar medium is relevant for theoretical models of the star formation rate, efficiency, and the initial mass function of stars. Here we use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations with grid resolutions of up to 1024 ^ 3 cells to model compressible turbulence in a regime similar to the observed interstellar medium. We use Fyris Alpha, a shock-capturing code employing a high-order Godunov scheme to track large density variations induced by shocks. We investigate the robustness of the standard relation between the logarithmic density variance (sigma_s^ 2) and the sonic Mach number (M) of isothermal interstellar turbulence, in the non-isothermal regime. Specifically, we test ideal gases with diatomic molecular (gamma = 7 / 5) and monatomic (gamma = 5 / 3) adiabatic indices. A periodic cube of gas is stirred with purely solenoidal forcing at low wavenumbers, leading to a fully-developed turbulent medium. We find that as the gas heats in adiabatic compressions, it evolves along the relationship in the density variance - <b>Mach</b> number <b>plane,</b> but deviates significantly from the standard expression for isothermal gases. Our main result is a new density variance - Mach number relation that takes the adiabatic index into account: sigma_s^ 2 = ln { 1 +b^ 2 *M^[(5 *gamma+ 1) / 3]} and provides good fits for b*M 1. We conclude that this new relation for adiabatic turbulence may introduce important corrections to the standard relation, if the gas is not isothermal.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{instability}} governing the self-sustained tones produced by a low <b>Mach</b> number free <b>plane</b> jet impinging on a slotted plate, known as slot-tone, is identified experimentally. The experimental apparatus permits to control the Reynolds number and {{the distance from the}} jet outlet to the plate. For a Reynolds number, the shear-layer natural frequency and the jet column mode frequency of the free jet without the obstacle are estimated and compared to the minimal and maximal frequencies of the tones (for any position of the plate). The frequency of both instabilities defines the frequency domain of the self sustained tones. The lowest frequencies of the tones, obtained when the plate is placed downstream the end of the potential core, are the result of the amplification of the column mode frequency. On the other hand, the maximal frequency of the tones, obtained when the plate is situated near the jet outlet, is close to the natural shear-layer frequency. Moreover, when the tones frequency is higher than the natural shear-layer frequency, the sound pressure level produced is very inferior to the maximal sound pressure level measured at the same Reynolds number. This confirms the prominent role of the shear-layer instability in the self-sustained tones process for the highest frequencies. Tones with a frequency lower than the jet column mode frequency are rarely observed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|While the SR-71 carried radar {{countermeasures}} to evade interception efforts, its greatest protection was its combination of high altitude and very high speed, {{which made it}} almost invulnerable. Along with its low radar cross-section, these qualities gave a very {{short amount of time}} for an enemy surface-to-air missile (SAM) site to acquire and track the aircraft on radar. By the time the SAM site could track the SR-71, it was often too late to launch a SAM, and the SR-71 would be out of range before the SAM could catch up to it. If the SAM site could track the SR-71 and fire a SAM in time, the SAM would expend nearly all of the delta-v of its boost and sustainer phases just reaching the SR-71's altitude: at this point, out of thrust, it would go ballistic. Merely accelerating would typically be enough for an SR-71 to evade a SAM; changes by the pilots in the SR-71's speed, altitude, and heading were also often enough to spoil any radar lock on the plane by SAM sites or enemy fighters. At sustained speeds of more than <b>Mach</b> 3.2, the <b>plane</b> was faster than the Soviet Union's fastest interceptor, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, which also could not reach the SR-71's altitude.
