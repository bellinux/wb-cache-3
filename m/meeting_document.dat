40|$|A Web-based {{technique}} {{for development of}} minutes for electronic meetings is presented. The minutes are developed by the secretarius (a participant responsible for administrative meeting activities) using Logan, a Web Electronic <b>Meeting</b> <b>Document</b> Manager (WEMDM). A WEMDM is used to support a range of <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> functionality, such as creation of agendas. Input into the post-meeting minutes creation process comes from both analysed meeting discussion and the re-use of summary points used during {{the review of the}} meeting. Analysis of discussion is provided by the verbatim minutes, one of a range of derivative documents generated by Logan to assist and enhance meeting discussion. The mechanism for minutes creation is covered, as well as explanation of derivatives, meeting guides and summary points created by using meeting guides...|$|E
40|$|Raikundalia (1998) {{presents}} {{a method for}} collaborative development of an agenda for computer-supported meetings. Meeting participants suggest items of discussion {{for inclusion in the}} agenda and the secretarius (a participant assigned administrative tasks, similar to a traditional secretary, but specifically for computer-supported meeting tasks) has the duty of determining which items may be included. This determination of relevant items is the process of secretarius moderation and was implemented in the prototype <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> manager, Logan. This paper proposes an extension to secretarius moderation that allows the chairperson also to moderate relevant items. Such an extension allows a group to decide if both the chairperson and secretarius or the secretarius only determine the content of agenda item discussion...|$|E

40|$|Kaindl’s scenario-based, object {{oriented}} method for requirements capture {{has proven to}} be useful for addressing the purposes within a scenario. Scenarios have been highly useful in software development. Unfortunately, scenarios typically have been used without explicitly dealing with the particular purposes of specific interactions within the scenario, or the interactions have been neglected or left implicit. Kaindl’s method complements scenarios with their purposes, achieving a more complete and consistent definition of a task model and requirements. This paper presents application of the method to the design of a Web electronic <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> manager. It is shown how Kaindl’s method has been extended further, including user interface design. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is the current standard in {{object oriented}} analysis and design.

40|$|Log files {{generated}} by electronic meeting software record the remarks typed by meeting participants {{and many other}} meeting events. In their raw format, these meeting logs are not convenient for the meeting participants to read and use as input to future meetings. LoganWeb is a tool which processes meeting log files and produces polymorphic meeting documents which contain a variety of summaries in human-readable form such as keyword indexes and participant summaries. LoganWeb generates polymorphic documents in the HTML format used for laying out documents on the World-Wide Web (Web). This allows exploitation of the powerful Web layout, hypertext and user interface facilities. Using a Web browser alongside the electronic meeting tool allows remotely located participants to consult valuable polymorphic documents from the current and past meetings. This paper describes {{the design of the}} user interface which is {{generated by}} LoganWeb in HTML. The design includes the extensive use of hyperlinks to bring together related meeting information. The powerful features of LoganWeb are illustrated by means of a meeting scenario which shows the main features of the <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> tool and its user interface...|$|E
40|$|Traditional, formal, {{face-to-face}} {{meetings are}} heavily reliant on documents for their conduct. One {{of the most}} prominent and important documents is the agenda. The agenda is vital for structuring and driving meeting discussion. The development of the agenda relies on contributions of items for discussion from meeting participants before the meeting. The secretary considers these items for their relevance and potential to achieve the meeting goal. A formal, electronic meeting, being a computer-supported equivalent of a traditional meeting, is also dependent on a useful and effective agenda for its success. This research article presents Logan, a Web Electronic <b>Meeting</b> <b>Document</b> Manager (WEMDM), that provides a novel, hypermedia-based technique for supporting the above agenda development process. Logan allows asynchronous, collaborative development of a meeting agenda. High participant involvement is supported through item contribution and secretarius moderation of contributions. Through a contribution rejection system, moderation supports selection of appropriate contributions for the agenda. Participants are helped in contributing relevant agenda items or prevented from contributing one similar to those in the current agenda via rejected contributions. The process allows flexibility in agenda development as the process may involve one or more iterations. The agenda development process is covered by displaying the interworking of participant agenda development pages. The many Web user interfaces used by the secretarius and other participants in agenda development are shown and described...|$|E

40|$|Summaries of {{meetings}} {{are very important}} as they convey the essential content of discussions in a concise form. Generally, it is time consuming to read and understand the whole documents. Therefore, summaries {{play an important role}} as the readers are interested in only the important context of discussions. In this work, we address the task of <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> summarization. Automatic summarization systems on meeting conversations developed so far have been primarily extractive, resulting in unacceptable summaries that are hard to read. The extracted utterances contain disfluencies that affect the quality of the extractive summaries. To make summaries much more readable, we propose an approach to generating abstractive summaries by fusing important content from several utterances. We first separate meeting transcripts into various topic segments, and then identify the important utterances in each segment using a supervised learning approach. The important utterances are then combined together to generate a one-sentence summary. In the text generation step, the dependency parses of the utterances in each segment are combined together to create a directed graph. The most informative and well-formed sub-graph obtained by integer linear programming (ILP) is selected to generate a one-sentence summary for each topic segment. The ILP formulation reduces disfluencies by leveraging grammatical relations that are more prominent in non-conversational style of text, and therefore generates summaries that is comparable to human-written abstractive summaries. Experimental results show that our method can generate more informative summaries than the baselines. In addition, readability assessments by human judges as well as log-likelihood estimates obtained from the dependency parser show that our generated summaries are significantly readable and well-formed.

The major fl aw {{was that it was}} a mistake to hold the two meetings at the same time in the same location since many attendees were inter-ested in both. Proposals for themed meetings to be held in 2014 are announced on page 10, and one more meeting, on the Transition to Adulthood, will be held October 18 - 20, 2012 also at the Tampa Marriott. Submissions are closed, and the number of submissions received indicates that this meeting will be as successful as the fi rst two. Organizers Rob Crosnoe and John Schulenberg have also planned an outstanding invited program. Further information is available on the SRCD website. I am very pleased that these meetings, initiated by Past President Greg Duncan, emerged as a new benefi t to members during my term as Executive Director. The purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of the topic of this next meeting, the Transition to Adulthood. The transition to adulthood has undergone as much social change in recent decades as any phenomenon that we as developmental scientists study. It used to be that young people graduated from school (high school or college), got a job, set up a household, got married, and started a family. Sociologists interested in this transition studied the density of these events in late adolescence and the early 20 ’s, attending to the sequencing and timing of these transitiona...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: At present, {{meeting is}} an {{activity}} which {{is necessary for}} work. &# 13; Gathering for discussing or solving problems is assumed {{that it has been}} held since the reign of His&# 13; Majesty King Chulalongkorn. The purposes of this research were these: (1) to investigate forms of&# 13; meeting documents in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn and the reign of His Majesty King&# 13; Bhumibol Adulyadej, (2) to analyses meeting procedures from the minutes of the meetings in the reign&# 13; of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn and the reign of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and (3) to&# 13; analyses Thai usage in the minutes of the meetings in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn&# 13; and the reign of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Approach: The meeting documents in the&# 13; reign of His Majesty King Chalalongkorn such as microfilms and four books of script photos were&# 13; analyzed, they consisted of four meeting document: (1) the minutes of the meeting of the Minister&# 13; Council in the first session on the Council of State Affairs Councilor, (2) the minute of the meeting of&# 13; the Minister Council in Rattanakosin Era of 111, (3) the minute of the meeting of the Minister Council&# 13; in the second session, part one in Rattanakosin Era of 112 and (4) the minutes of the meeting of the&# 13; Minister Council in the third session in Rattanakosin Era of 113. A total pages of these documents was&# 13; 1, 000 pages. A sample was 6 experts I creating meeting documents and 1 linguistic expert. Research&# 13; data were collected by means of an interview, the data were analyzed by means of an interpretation and&# 13; a composition technique and were presented by means of a descriptive analysis. Results: (1) Forms of&# 13; meeting documents in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn and His Majesty King Bhumibol&# 13; Adulyadej consisted of these: (i) A law of meeting regulations, (ii) a document of meeting schedule&# 13; and agenda, (iii) the minutes of the meeting, (iv) a <b>meeting</b> <b>document</b> and (v) an after-meeting&# 13; document (2) Meeting procedures in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn were proceeded&# 13; according to a law of meeting regulations; for example the regulations of the meeting, the minutes of&# 13; the meeting and the Royal Decree on Principle ad procedure for discussion meeting. Meeting&# 13; procedures in the reign of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej divided into 2 types were these: (i) &# 13; holding a meeting according to regulations ad holding a meeting according to an agenda (general&# 13; meeting) (ii) Thai usage in the minute of the meeting in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn&# 13; ad His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej had the differences in writing style, idioms, outlines and&# 13; technical terms. Conclusion/Recommendations: Research results revealed the difference in forms and&# 13; linguistic usage of meeting documents between in the reign of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn ad His&# 13; Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, especially the differences in writing styles, idioms, outlines and&# 13; technical terms concerning the meeting...|$|E
