5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E

5|$|Despite safety measures, {{incidents}} <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> {{during the}} Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse {{under the weight}} of the many visitors. During 2015 Hajj, a stampede resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others, according to the Saudi authorities. A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries, making it the most deadly such episode to date. Concerns were raised in 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj. Saudi Health Minister Abdullah Al-Rabia said authorities have detected no cases of MERS among the pilgrims so far. He also said that, despite few cases of MERS, Saudi Arabia was ready for the 2014 pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|To have {{qualified}} for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be {{a citizen of the}} nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> only once in the player's life.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls {{living in}} {{tropical}} regions can breed {{at any time}} of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.|$|E

5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E
